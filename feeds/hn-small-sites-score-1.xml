<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <p>My problem in life is that if I am doing something, I tend to try to get the most out of it. That is what people call maximalism.</p>
<p>It has been present in the habits that I tried implementing as well. It has been present in a gym membership. It has been present in learning a new language. Basically, I couldn’t do anything a healthy amount and tried to do as much as I could straight away.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed it, even though in the potential that would allow me to get the most amount of results out of the action, it would also cause me to burn out very fast. Usually so fast, that the first results just started showing when I quit.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">James Clear Atomic Habits</a>, I understood that the biggest problem with positive habit-forming is exactly what I have been doing. It said that starting with a hard habit is what will make it less likely to stick. While on the other hand, making a habit small and easy is exactly what would make a habit stick and would allow you to scale it after a period of time potentially.</p>
<p>Going to the gym every day, 7 days a week for one hour was the initial goal I would usually set. Now it's: put running shoes and walk outside of your house for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Reading 50 books in a year, now became read a page per day.</p>
<p>Learn how to build Facebook. Now is: learn how to make this button blue.</p>
<p>Everything became smaller and much easier to do. The result? I have been in the habit of doing things for more than 3 months, and I would never go back.</p>
<h2>Why Maximalism is not always bad</h2>
<p>The good news for me is that I only have to battle with my inner understanding of the world when I start as long as I have started and the habit in the motion of slowly integrating with my life, I can also start to scale it slowly. That is how I started with everything so far and to be completely honest, I don’t see a reason to do it any other way.</p>
<p>The main issue of why positive habits are so much harder to integrate in comparison to the negative habits is because the rewards and the dopamine hits are postponed to some time in the future. Actually so far, that our short term brain doesn’t see it.</p>
<p>That is why by making a habit easy and maybe even pairing with some positive reward for yourself, would make the habit sticking more likely. </p>
<p>Make sure that what you do is good for you, before putting down the reward. <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/nano-problems-09-12-2020">Don’t reward yourself for doing yourself worse.</a></p>
<h2>Why small habits count</h2>
<p>Even though some habits have stayed for me <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/practice-makes-perfect-30-11-2020">very small</a>, the presence of that small habit in my life has <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/front-page-hn">changed me completely</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t understand why spending 10 minutes per day doing something can improve me so much, then I remembered James Clear maths example.</p>
<p>1.01^365 = 37.8</p>
<p>Which is crazy to think about, and it turns out it is also true in practice.</p>
<p>Even if you can only do 5 minutes of something per day, don’t postpone it. In a month or even a year, you will look back, and you will be a completely different, better person.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>

</pre></div>


<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

December 11, 2020 | https://blog.freeyourgadget.org/on-building-bridges.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.freeyourgadget.org/on-building-bridges.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Cool gadgets give us some really great possibilities, like tracking our
activities, controlling music and smart home devices, receiving notifications
and more. But in our strive for better, faster, lighter, smarter, cheaper... we
often forget the down side of our endeavors. Apps providing connections to our
devices do receive all our movement information, including precise location. We
have written about it <a href="https://blog.freeyourgadget.org/why-gadgetbridge.html">previously</a>, in 2017. But maybe
you do not care about the details of your whereabouts being shared and only
care about your communication. And your communication with friends and family
is surely safe with secure apps that have become widely popular, right? But
unfortunately, every notification that is forwarded to your smart bracelet even
though you received it from some very secure, end to end encrypted app like
Matrix or Signal, has been seen by the bracelet's companion app. These are
closed source applications provided mostly by the vendor of the gadget and it
is only up to the vendor to decide if they send these conversations to their
servers for further processing. It is now up to us to decide if we want to give
them fully detailed view into our lives.</p>
<p>So this is where Gadgetbridge comes in, of course, but it is important to
realize that it takes a substantial effort to keep things running correctly. To
ensure stable Bluetooth connection. To provide reliable firmware update system.
To collect and display daily activities in a user friendly way. To keep up with
firmware updates of all those supported watches and make sure stuff does not
break (too much). And also, to provide a safe bridge between the smart bracelet
and the phone, so notifications are not observed by other applications. For
these very reason, Gadgetbridge does not have any network access, in fact it
does not have network permission, so the Android system does not allow it to
have any network communication at all. And this is good - good for the safety,
good for the clear mind. Nice, clean, safe bridge between your phone and your
smart bracelet's app. Thanks to all currently active but also to all previously
very active developers for all the hard work!</p>
<p>But we must have even higher goals. People would like to not only collect their
own data, but they also want to use it, look at it, analyze it or share it - if
they want. So we should not only collect all the steps, activities hear
rates... we must also provide a way to export it to be able to use it on day to
day bases, easily. To share for example GPS information recorded on some
watches, Gadgetbridge does allow exporting GPX files of recorded sports
activities as files or as intents that other applications can use. Gadgetbridge
can also export full database of all collected stuff (steps, heart rate and so
on), together with all user preferences. But we must ensure that there are also
apps that can receive our data - we should build more connections between our
apps. Recently, the good folks at <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.dennisguse.opentracks/">Open
Tracks</a> improved their
GPX input intent listener, providing yet another app that can directly receive
recorded GPS track shared by Gadgetbridge. They also worked hard to navigate
through the confusing landscape of Bluetooth Low Energy communication to be
able to accept data from heart rate sensor, enabled on the bracelet via
Gadgetbridge settings. Same heart rate data can now also be used with the
<a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.tadris.fitness/">FitoTrack</a>. The
<a href="https://infinitime.io/">InfiniTime</a> developers
<a href="https://infinitime.io/blog/2020-10/infinitime-0-9-0/">improved</a> music controls
and firmware updates, making a nice connection to Gadgetbridge. And we all
should keep looking around for improving things in our small islands of app
created silos and connect them with nice bridges. I strongly advice you to be
creative in your thinking, talk to the developers of your favorite apps and
propose ways for apps to keep talking to each other. No <strike>[hu]man</strike> app should be
an island.</p></div></div>]]>

You need to be deliberate about what you create. Your podcast gets its uniqueness from you, as you are the creator and director. </p><p>Your podcast is a result of your<strong> imagination</strong> and your <strong>ability to execute</strong>.</p><p>You must have a reason for starting your podcast, and this where the “WHY” and “WHAT” questions come in. The answer to these questions will help you create a podcast that is both unique to you but will also be able to add massive value to anyone that subscribes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Why Do You Want To Start A Podcast?</strong></h3><p>There are various reasons for starting a podcast, and it varies per person. This question can have a lot of answers, but your conviction is the most important factor.</p><p><em>How much do you want to start a podcast?</em></p><p>Because if your answer is not a firm yes, then you may have challenges putting in the consistent effort to make it grow.</p><p><em>Why do you want to start a podcast?</em></p><p>There could be various reasons...<br></p><ul role="list"><li>To promote your business</li><li>To talk about your passion</li><li>To preach to the world</li><li>To share your message</li><li>To establish yourself as an authority</li><li>To have fun</li></ul><p>Whatever your reason is, you must be convinced.</p><p>This conviction will help you create a lasting relationship with your audience as you continue to execute over time when others fail to be consistent.</p><p>If&nbsp;you look at all the most popular podcasts... you will see that they have been running for years and even decades. This is what you must be prepared to do to generate a sizeable audience.</p><h3><strong>What Is The Topic Of Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>It's now time to choose a theme/topic for your podcast. </p><p>This is the BIG one. It's make or break.</p><p>You MUST consider:</p><ul role="list"><li>Your passion on the topic</li><li>Your expertise and experience of the topic</li><li>The ability for your to monetise the topic</li></ul><p>Here at bCast, we are all about podcast profitability. We're not hobbyists. We know you need to get paid if you're going to do this for the long term and build a podcast worth listening to.</p><p>Now monetisation can come from advertising... so you don't necessarily need to have products or services in the niche or topic of your podcast... but you will need an intense passion.</p><p>Once you have spent a long time sitting in a dark room thinking about this... you then need to understand the #1 thing that will define the success or failure of your podcast:</p><p><strong><em>How are you different or better for a specific group of people?</em></strong></p><p>As if you are not... and you don't have a load of money to spend on Facebook Ads, it's going to be hard to make your podcast grow. Trust me... we know.</p><p>Maybe you only ask specific types of questions; perhaps you focus on a particular niche, perhaps you only interview three people at a time… it can be anything as long as it makes you different or better for a specific group of people.</p><p>If you are VERY particular about this… you will more than double your chances of succeeding.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Your Listeners?</strong></h3><p>Now that you have answered the WHY and WHAT, it is time to answer the WHO question.</p><p>Every podcast needs listeners, and in order for your podcast to grow... you must know exactly who your listeners are and where to find them.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-08046cb77a20-4992c8f8"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8d8ab496d65849f731ba00/5fa3cf937aa690314e79dafd__co8aVE5evZ3_Tzk8ZugkGqAFkT8oBN3HT-ksoEWq5FNU4yYXhOaV3P8uJZ27GaH8Ha-aIdbGh3PPQqOLLXsAZ-K6sSfKjXfmjcmVJW5xRfolNsufXY7OnFRKVLn4GMako-ZIAM_.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>You need to find out:</p><ul role="list"><li>Where they are&nbsp;</li><li>How old they are</li><li>What catches their attention</li><li>What they eat for breakfast</li><li>Who they hate</li><li>Who they love</li></ul><p>This is why it's normally a great strategy for you to actually BE&nbsp;YOUR&nbsp;PERFECT&nbsp;LISTENER. This is a shortcut through this stage of the process as if this is the case, you should know the answers to all of those questions ;)</p><p>Once this is defined you then need to list out a number of places where these people hang out online:</p><ul role="list"><li>Blogs</li><li>Other podcasts</li><li>Facebook Groups</li><li>subReddits</li><li>Linkedin Groups</li><li>YouTube Channels</li></ul><p>We will need this list later in the process when we move through the launch and grow stages.</p><h3><strong>How Do You Name Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>There are a number of strategies to follow here...</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Make it concise</em></strong></li></ul><p>Succinct podcast names land better as they convey the message most strongly.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Do not neglect the relevant keyword</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>If your podcast is about soccer, let the name convey that; this is important in searches, as your podcast name will pop up in searches related to your industry.</p><ul role="list"><li>‍<strong><em>Make it easy on the tongue</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>You don’t want a twisted name, as you will mention it time and again on your podcast – it should be smooth to say.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Keep it simple</em></strong></li></ul><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>You don’t want the stress of explaining your podcast name every time. Embrace simplicity</p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>Look out for rhyme and alliteration opportunities</em></strong></li></ul><p>The best names of anything normally incorporate rhyme and/or alliteration... be on the look out for these opportunities and incorporate them if they arise.</p><p>To make this clearer... here are some great examples along with an explanation for why:</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/sales-ops-demystified" target="_blank"><strong>Sales Ops Demystified</strong></a>: We include the core key word AND the value proposition of the show. It's clear and concise and succinctly tells the potential listener why they should listen.</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/mobile-growth-pancakes" target="_blank"><strong>Mobile Growth and Pancakes</strong></a>: Keyword conscious and not boring. This podcast name is exciting, and a listener will want to hear what they have to say. It lays a foundation for what to expect, which is discussing mobile growth in a fun and slightly... different way.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/shine-a-podcast-by-star" target="_blank"><strong>Shine: a Podcast by Star</strong></a>: Simple and short. The host already directs the listener's thought from the first word. It also promotes the host, as a name is attached to the podcast and conveys an aspect of the hosts brand: shining through technology.</p><p><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/be-more-a-podcast-by-peakon" target="_blank"><strong>Be More - a podcast by Peakon</strong></a>: If you want to be more, you have to listen. Everyone wants to be more, and this podcast name exploits that emotional aspect with this name: it's aspirational. The listener wants to know how they can "be more".&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How Do You Describe Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>Research has shown that your <a href="https://www.thepodcasthost.com/promotion/podcast-discoverability/" target="_blank">podcast description</a> is the number one factor that new listeners consider when deciding whether to subscribe. When describing your podcast, you must be able to offer value to the listener quickly. You must tell in precise terms, what they stand to gain by listening to your show.</p><p>You also have to consider search engines as you construct e your podcast description. Your show description must be able to rank to stand a chance of getting any free exposure from Google. Include relevant keywords in the industry you cover.&nbsp;</p><p>When writing your description, you should consider attention span. You need to grab listeners' attention by putting the juicy points first. You also need to make fair use of the description by avoiding repetition.&nbsp;</p><p>Be concise, offer value, and grab attention with the first lines.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How Do You Pick The Right Category For Your Podcast?</strong></h3><p>The primary way podcast listeners discover podcasts is through searching within podcast listening apps. They navigate through different categories and topics and look for the best shows in that category – <strong>this is why</strong> you need to place your podcast in the right category. It will increase the chance that your perfect listener will discover your podcast.</p><p>You get three chances:</p><ul role="list"><li>1 Primary category</li><li>2 Sub categories</li></ul><p>I won't share much more on this as I assume you know the category in which your podcast should reside!</p><h3><strong>What Podcast Format Should You Adopt?</strong></h3><p>There are different formats for podcasts. The good thing is, you have creative control over the structure of your podcast. In most cases, the format you choose depends on the message you are trying to convey to your audience.&nbsp;</p><p>There are different types of formats:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Interview podcast:</strong> this format involves a host that brings guests on the show, and interviews them. These guests are usually experts in their field, and the host asks them relevant questions in their industry.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Monologue podcast:</strong> this format involves the host alone. The host will run solo and speak about their experiences and area of expertise. It is mostly educational and a teaching type of format.</li><li><strong>Co-hosted podcast:</strong> this format will involve two hosts that will have conversations. They share their experiences and have a back and forth when needed.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Story-based podcast:</strong> this format involves a host that tells a story like a drama to the audience. The story could be fiction or non-fiction. The host finds ways to spice it up through the use of different effects.</li></ul><p>That said, there is room for more than one format on your podcast. You could adopt different forms for different episodes, depending on the message you are trying to pass.</p><p>So why not start out with one... test, gather …</p></div></div></div></div>

So I did.</p><p>And there we were, talking about everything — his political education, why he goes back and forth between thinking of himself as a progressive and not, his highly influential recent book, “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>” — when my phone began to crackle with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">news of an historic antitrust case against Facebook</a>.</p><p>Naturally, I began to ask Matt about it.

Today: Matt Stoller on Facebook, this important case, and how monopoly is mistaken as a policy issue when in fact it represents an existential question of whether we are actually a democracy.</p><p>Then, before long, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107144/">part deux</a>, the political education of Matt Stoller — thinker, writer, civil servant, trustbuster, Twitter beefer, and, presently, aspiring political philosopher.</p><p>Without shame, I’ll add, in the spirit of Matt’s ideas, that if you want to do your part to support small, independent media, and haven’t yet, consider subscribing to The Ink.</p><h3>“The way we do business is the way we do justice”: a conversation with Matt Stoller, part one</h3><p>ANAND: Right as we're talking, I get a news alert: “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/facebook-antitrust-monopoly.html">Facebook illegally crushed competition by buying up its rivals, according to lawsuits filed by 48 states and federal regulators</a>.” So this is the big case that we've been waiting for. Can you explain to a person who has never focused on this issue before in their life, and who just uses Facebook to try to get with their high-school ex, why is this a big deal? What does this mean?</p><p>MATT: So Facebook is a financial conglomerate. People think of Facebook as that website you use or the app that you use, but really Facebook, as a political institution, is a financial conglomerate and owns dozens of different companies, including Instagram and WhatsApp and Facebook, the social network. And it's a giant advertising company. So they have roughly three billion users. And they try to get their users to do things that their advertisers want them to do, because that's how you sell advertising.</p><p>The business model is to divert revenue that used to go to newspapers and publishers to themselves. And so by manipulating people in this specific way that they do, which is to keep them using their system and keep surveilling them so that they can target them with ads, they are, in the process, crushing newspapers and publishers, who no longer have any financing, particularly local newspapers and niche publications like Black-owned newspapers.</p><p>So increasingly those kinds of publications don't exist. You don't have reporters covering state houses and city halls and whatnot. Instead, people are now consuming things that Facebook likes them to consume because it keeps them using, and it keeps them available to sell ads to them, which are anti-social publications or posts, like anti-vax stuff or QAnon or whatever it is.</p><p>So that's the basic problem. It's a $70-, $80-, $100-billion-a-year revenue company that's destroying newspapers and publishers all over the world and getting people to pass conspiracy theories to each other so that Facebook can make money on advertising.</p><p>ANAND: You're an anti-monopoly guy. If there were three or five companies in healthy competition with each other, all doing exactly what you just described, wouldn't it still be problematic? Is the issue here that there's only one of them of that heft, or would a competitive market with five such players still be incredibly troubling?</p><p>MATT: There's a lot more that you have to do than just break them up. But the answer is, it would improve things dramatically if they were broken up, and you don't have to imagine it.</p><p>There used to be a bunch of social networks. Facebook's main competitor was Myspace, but there were a bunch of others. There was BlackPlanet; there was Friendster. And the way that Facebook actually defeated Myspace was by promising a safer, more private experience. They defeated Myspace by saying, We will treat your data carefully; in fact, when we change the terms of service, we will let our users vote on the terms of service.</p><p>This was back in 2007, 2008, 2009. And once they killed their competition, and then they bought up nascent competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp, then they didn't have to compete by offering a higher-quality service, a.k.a one that was less intrusive in terms of surveillance. They could just surveil anybody they wanted, and you didn't really have a choice.</p><p>ANAND: Where do you think this case is going?</p><p>MATT: They’re going to aim to break up the company. The House Antitrust Subcommittee did this long investigation of big tech, which includes Facebook. And one of the things they found is that Mark Zuckerberg was writing emails saying they were buying these companies to block competition. And so that's evidence that the mergers were illegal, because you're not supposed to buy companies to block competition. That's a violation of the Clayton Act. My guess is that they're going to have a pretty good complaint.&nbsp;</p><p>ANAND: Based on the history of such cases, would your assumption be that Facebook is broken up within a period of years?</p><p>MATT: Yes.</p><p>However, we haven't enforced the law for 20 years, so it’s not entirely clear. The law at this point is crazy and incoherent because we haven't done enforcement, and to the extent that we have, judges have just made wildly inconsistent rulings.</p><p>ANAND: This kind of action that's being announced today is the epitome of a systemic, public response to a problem. And when I, like you, advocate for those types of things, I often hear this response that I'm sure you do, too, which is, “OK, that's fine, but what about individual actions?” A lot of people are like, “Yes, let’s delete Facebook.” Or: “Why aren't you supporting the Facebook boycott?”, and there are different views on it.</p><p>There are some people who make the argument that those kind of small personal things are sideshows, distractions, maybe even unhelpful, because they reduce the perceived need for bigger systemic change. I fall more into that camp. There are others who say it's a gateway drug, it's a waystation, like: “Delete Facebook and then work yourself up to a political response." How do you weigh in on that?</p><p>MATT: I think it's a bad vision of politics. It's not doing politics to say, “Me, as a consumer, I can change power arrangements based on what I consume or don’t.” That's a real 1970s consumer-rights Democrat vision of the world, and that's one in which you as a citizen are irrelevant.</p><p>A boycott is only political if the goal is a policy change. If you go in and you say, "Well, I don't like Facebook, I want to change Facebook, so I'm going to delete Facebook," that's not going to do anything. If it's part of some larger political action saying, "Well, I'm going to delete Facebook, and then I'm going to push policymakers to break it up," I mean, I guess that makes sense.</p><p>But the general view of these boycotts is that just not using Facebook is the political action. But that's actually not a political action.</p><p>ANAND: An issue like monopoly is different from, say, healthcare, where you don't have to explain to most people the problem with our healthcare system. How do you think about making the issue of monopoly real to people and vivid and relevant to their lives?</p><p>MATT: I'm going to challenge the premise. I don't think monopoly is an <em>issue</em>. I think monopoly is a worldview.</p><p>My book is called “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Goliath/Matt-Stoller/9781501182891">Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy</a>.” Anti-monopolism is a lens through which you understand power, and particularly commercial power. That’s the lens that I see the world through. And I don't just focus on Facebook or Google. I’m focused on anti-monopolism in general. How you use business institutions to coerce and bully — or liberate — other people in your society.</p><p>There's a monopolist who controls the cheerleading industry, which is very weird. I just learned there is a private-equity company that is trying to monopolize the software that churches run. There is a monopoly of Ultimate Fighting Championship-style contests. And then in healthcare there are endless numbers of monopolists. Ultimately, what a monopolist is is a person or institution that is controlling and governing a market. It's a private government versus a public government.</p><p>ANAND: You’re saying it’s incompatible with democracy.</p><p>MATT: Right. It’s a different system. When Mark Zuckerberg says he’s going to arrange electoral discourse in this particular way, or going to start a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-first-20-members-of-facebook-supreme-court-2020-5">Supreme Court</a>, or going to ban this or allow that, he is operating as the global privacy commissioner. <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/4/9/17214752/zuckerberg-facebook-power-regulation-data-privacy-control-political-theory-data-breach-king">He even said</a>, "In a lot of ways Facebook is more like a government than a traditional company." That's a direct quote.</p><p>As a society, the way we do business is the way we do justice.</p><p>ANAND: Understanding how these platforms work, do you think that if Mark Zuckerberg wanted to tip an election, he could? Would that even be illegal under our current system?</p><p>MATT: I don't know if it's possible, but it's certainly legal if he decided to.</p><p>I listened to this podcast with Zuckerberg where he said — this was right before he became unpopular, so he was still being relatively …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><p>No, engineers don’t suck at time estimates - and generally speaking humans are better estimators than what most people believe. This seems rather surprising given all we’ve heard about the problems of bad time estimations, projects going overboard, etc and of course, your personal experience with software time estimates. But if people are really bad at estimation, how does that fit with our obvious evolutionary need to make quick decisions based on partial data? if we can’t estimate well how did we decide if a gap is wide enough to jump over, if an animal is worth the hunt, if a certain area is more likely to have water and shade? Without estimation skills we wouldn’t survive. So what’s going on?</p><p>One obvious explanation is that we are only good at estimating physical things such as sizes and distances. However, this does not seem likely given the large number of non-physical decisions we needed to make, like selecting a mate.
Another, more likely explanation is that the estimates are good, but the interpretation and usage of the estimates is flawed. In other (slightly cynical) words: the engineers are good at estimating, it’s the project managers who suck at using the estimates.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>“your estimate was wrong” - is something i’ve heard many times. But this sentence doesn’t make any sense… after all, an estimate is by definition not exact; in fact, if the results would always agree with estimates foul play would be immedialy suspected. If I estimated one day and the actual time was 1.5 days, was I “wrong”? most people would say I wasn’t. But if if the actual time was 20 days most people would argue I was wrong. Somewhere between one and 20 days there is an implicit “reasonable error” threshold we never discussed! I never gave an error margin for my estimate, did I?</p><p>Since we don’t expect an estimate to be an exact guess of the actual value, what do we expect from an estimate? When we make decisions based on estimates, we can only be right or wrong in our decision, you can’t be “a lot more right”. We need to guess a value beyond a certain threshold and within a certain tolerance, with high probability of being right because that our lives depend on that gap being just short enough for us to jump over. Decisions are almost always non-linear like that and it should not be surprising given the nature of knowledge and learning. We take in examples and extrapolate patterns and behaviours. Which means we are dealing with groups, and probability distributions. This may be surprising at first, because when you are estimating this one <em>particular</em> job, you don’t think of a distribution of a million other <em>different</em> jobs. An estimate is predicting the future in which we see the actual value.
</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/time-estimate.jpg" alt="/img/time-estimate.jpg"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/time-estimate.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div><p>What we need to know, is that in a certain number of futures, say 90% of them, a value won’t be over or under a certain threshold. Or phrased mathematically, that the 90th percentile of the distribution of futures will be over (or under) a certain number. An estimate is a percentile! but which percentile? is it the median? the 99th?
For software time estimates it has been <a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html">observed to be the median</a> (50th percentile), meaning to be right about half the times. Is this inherent? Estimates can desmonstrably be calibrated to higher percentiles by as little as <a href="https://www.tonym-v.com/blog/2019/10/2/improve-your-estimations-with-the-equivalent-bet-test">brief emotional self manipulation</a>; You could easily estimate the 90th percentile of many things - just read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business-ebook/dp/B00INUYS2U">How to measure anything</a>.</p><p>Usally when I tell this to people, they often respond with “we’ll train to estimate the average”. Sadly, this is not possible. The mean is a statistically “unstable” or “unrobust” aggregate, where as percentiles are “stable” or “robust”. Consider a group of task completion times [73, 67, 12, 38, 18, 11, 42]. The mean is ~37.29 and the median is pretty close, 38. But as soon as we get another measurement, say 293, the mean changes significantly to 69.25 while the median changes only slightly to 42. The mean is sensitive to outliers, and the more skewed and high variance the distribution the less robust and stable it will be.</p><p>Having estimated tasks, what do we do with them? We sum them up.</p><p>Either for project budget or for by enqueuing with the next tasks, we sum them. But wait, we know that percentiles are not additive! how can this ever work? it never does. Summing up percentiles compounds errors and with skewed distributions, and in particular heavy tailed distributions, the errors are very large. Let’s have a look at what a task completion time distribution would look like:</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/task-time-distribution.png" alt="/img/task-time-distribution.png"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/task-time-distribution.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div><p>A task has some minimum time it has to take, but beyond that it can pretty much take as long as inifinity. We all know from experience, that when things get out of control they go wayyyy out of control. Once you hit a rare bug, you might be chasing a wild goose for two months. That 10% over the estimate might be a day late or a year, the higher percentile you pick the more extreme the errors relatively.</p><p>To be honest, it’s old news; This has been known for a long time. Percentile based project predictions have been done as early as World War II, perhaps even before that - yet they remain fairly unknown in the industry. Not only are we ignorant of proven methods, we invent new ones which are outright harmful. Remember that burn down chart? the <em>backlog</em> is nothing more than a sum of time estimates! And every two weeks, sitting in the famous sprint retrospective people work to calibrate their estimates to the random walk sum of task completion times on the burndown chart. How do you calibrate a percentile to a sum? If the distribution is something like a log-normal distribution, the random walk sum will converge to the mean, and the median is relatively close to the mean - which is summable, and both are pretty stable. So by repeatedly calibrating estimates to the running-sum of task completion times (the backlog) you will converge close to the median. Now go tell your project manager there is a 50% chance of their project running late, anywhere between a day and eternity, and see how they respond. A 50% chance of uncapped delay is a useless estimate.</p><p><strong>Scrum is a training method for useless time estimates</strong>. It actively destroys your ability to manage your project.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against Agile; The spirit of Agile, some of the methods and ceremonies of Scrum have value. But Scrum <em>as a system</em> is actively harmful, especially in high variance situations where the work is far from the nice log-normal distribution. If you <a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/the-burndown-chart-fallacy/">optimize for an arbitrary metric</a>, you will get arbitrary results. In ops/SRE and pure research many people have intuitive sense that Scrum and traditional project management are wrong, although they can’t quite articulate why. The reasons become very clear when we consider what happens to sum based project management methods if the task distribution becomes heavy tailed. A task that is one week late is likely to take <em>at least</em> one more week - is a common thumb rule in such domains; This is called a “Power law” and can be modeled by the famous Pareto distribution. The thing about the Pareto distribution is that its mean does not converge! In other words, using sum based planning methods with such distributions is equivalent to managing by rolling dice. A little worse actually, as dice are a cheap method of generating random numbers where as time estimates are intrusive and sometimes expensive. This isn’t a problem unique to Scrum, nor does it originate from it. The problem is the assumption of determinism and accuracy which is the prevaling “machine age” mindset. Pretty much all of the common project management tools have the same issue - have a look at a Gantt chart, it has no probability intervals or error ranges. They are all worse than useless. It shouldn’t be a surprise that despite people being bad at estimating large tasks naive estimates are reliably more accurate than project management tools.</p><p>Recognizing the probabilistic nature of the world is key. Probability isn’t a tool for making predictions, it is a tool for quantifiying uncertainty. Instead of managing resources (which are usually highly certain) we should be managing uncertainty, with probabilistic methods appropriate for the task. With this mindset, the first thing to do is understand the business context and the distributions involed: are you in a low or high variation domain? Industrial methods which aim to improve throughput and efficiency all assume low variance, sometimes actively force low variance by getting rid of outliers; this isn’t necessarily possible in your business context. Industrial methods are good when used in context, but horrible when used in high variability and unpredictable domains. For those we have other methods, which emphasize low latency and rapid adaptation. Instead of Scrum, you could try:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/">Monte-Carlo simulations based on time estimates</a></li><li><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.1-chapter-07">Time boxing and bets</a></li><li>Latency optimizing methods which dispense with time estimates, like Kanban</li></ul><p>I’ve listed the methods above in order of rising uncertainty, Monte-Carlo simulations or time boxing would probably be easiest to start with. The biggest obstacle in implementing these is convincing managers that “predictability” isn’t so important as they imagine. For high variation domains it’s nothing more than a fantasy anyway.</p><p>So there you have it: people don’t suck at estimation. They suck at management 🤷</p><hr></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PRCyBqa.jpg" alt=""><div><section><p>Kubernetes has become the <em>de facto</em> container orchestrator since it's initial release in 2014. It is a great tool for managing diverse workloads in clusters of machines, possibly spanning multiple availability zones. As the usage grows, new requirements for how to deploy and operate specialized software emerges. The Operator pattern is one of the more prominent responses to these new requirements.</p>
</section><article><section><p>The Operator pattern is best described in the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">official Kubernetes documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Operator pattern aims to capture the key aim of a human operator who is managing a service or set of services. Human operators who look after specific applications and services have deep knowledge of how the system ought to behave, how to deploy it, and how to react if there are problems.</p>
<p>People who run workloads on Kubernetes often like to use automation to take care of repeatable tasks. The Operator pattern captures how you can write code to automate a task beyond what Kubernetes itself provides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Operators automate operation of applications and services with human know-how.</p>
<h2>How does an Operator work?</h2>
<p>An Operator consists at a minimum of one Custom Resource Definition (<code>CRD</code>) and a Controller. The <code>CRD</code> describes the various configuration options for this kind of resource. Given a custom resource for a <code>PostgresDatabase</code>, one might find options for specifying custom <code>StorageClass</code>es, resource allocation, backup schedule/destinations, authentication methods, etc.</p>
<p>Given an instance (<code>CR</code>) of <code>PostgresDatabase</code>, it's now the job of the controller to ensure that the desired state is reconciled with the cluster. In this example one can assume that the controller will create a <code>StatefulSet</code> for running the database itself, along with needed configuration in a <code>ConfigMap</code>, certificates for mutual TLS in a <code>Secret</code>. Backup can be done by either mounting and writing to a volume defined in the <code>CR</code> or injecting a sidecar for sending backups to another location.</p>
<p>Patching, reboots and failovers can be specified in the <code>CR</code> and taken care of by the controller, using methods recommended by experienced DBA's. The fact that complex operational knowledge can be encoded into the controller is a key enabler for many organizations that would like to run complex software, but not necessarily invest countless hours into learning the nitty-gritty details on how to operate it.</p>
<p>Like any other software there will be bugs and abstractions will leak. There's no silver bullet.</p>
<h2>How do I create my own Operator?</h2>
<p>As with the rest of the Kubernetes community, multiple solutions exists.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a declarative experience, check out <a href="https://kudo.dev/">KUDU</a></li>
<li>If you'd like a more official way to do it, see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder">kubebuilder</a></li>
<li>The most popular option seems to be <a href="https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk">Operator SDK</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As with most cloud native software, Go seems to be the lingua franca. There is nothing stopping you from writing an Operator in Java, C#, Python or any other language that can communicate with the Kubernetes APIs.</p>
<h2>Examples of known Operators</h2>
<p>The community has produced a lot of Operators for about everything one can imagine. These are some popular examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd">Argo CD</a> – a  declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager">cert-manager</a> – automatically provisions TLS certificates via the ACME protocol. Can be used with certificate issuers such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, <a href="https://www.buypass.no/ssl/resources/acme-free-ssl">Buypass</a> and <a href="https://zerossl.com/documentation/acme/">ZeroSSL</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator">Prometheus Operator</a> – often used in combination with <a href="https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus">kube-prometheus</a> for a batteries included monitoring suite</li>
<li><a href="https://kubedb.com/">KubeDB</a> – a real-life implementation of the <code>PostgresDatabase</code> example, plus support for MySQL/MariaDB/MongoDB/Redis/Memcached and more</li>

If the physicist-dad discovers a method to get the baby to eat her breakfast, it is unlikely to work by dinner. This is significant because eating is one of four fundamental dimensions of the Baby Universe, and the same principle of random solutions also applies to the other three: playing, crying and sleeping.

My thesis-writing wife’s fresh-pumped milk was in demand and its administration required complex algorithms for its optimal, timely use. Solid food, once introduced, posed a whole new set of problems, as each spoonful required extensive parental coercion. This may have had its upsides: recent research shows that the more you talk to your child, the higher the child’s IQ will be. The fine print that the researchers don’t mention is that this IQ boost comes at your expense, as you must donate those IQ points to the child via non-stop one-way conversations: “Look. Yams. Mmmmm. You like yams. You liked yams yesterday. Oooh, yaaaaaams.”</p><p>Later, my daughter acquired a rudimentary ability to feed herself, and the physics of the eating dimension became more complex. If I offer her a spoonful of food, she comes running to see what is on the spoon. If the food is not to her liking, she is scattered like a charged particle from a similarly charged hard sphere. But when, instead, a sticky ball of white rice is presented to her, it triggers a primal urge to make chaos. The “entropy of rice” principle dictates that the dispersion of rice across a 2D “table” is sudden, yet erratic. After adequate time, every grain of rice is scattered into a circle with a radius equal to one baby arm. Given infinite time, it is predicted that babies would not rest until every grain of rice was at every end of the universe.</p><p><img src="https://smalldata.dev/images/baby_physics/yogurt_face.jpeg" alt="baby - yogurt face">
<sup>Photo credit : Debby Shemella, aka Grandma (2012)</sup></p><p>As the preceding paragraph indicates, the “eating” dimension of the Baby Universe is closely coupled to the “playing” dimension. Before she could crawl or walk, my daughter would nevertheless want to change her position during playtime. She employed the theory of relativity to satisfy this urge: by moving her playmat from underneath her, she could therefore move herself off the mat. Once mobile, she liked to increase her potential energy by dragging herself up and onto whatever obstacle she could find. If stairs existed, that obstacle was most definitely stairs. This is unfortunate, because although babies understand gravity if they are dropping something (and can even anticipate the “Boom!” the object makes upon impact), they have no comprehension of gravity if they are the body upon which it is acting. It is therefore the physicist-parent’s job to decrease the baby’s potential energy whenever it grows too large, and it is the baby’s work to regain what was taken away.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbAYEdjcyjc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe></p><p><sup><em>The
<a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PechaKucha</a> talk that started this research.</em></sup></p><p>The two remaining dimensions of the Baby Universe – crying and sleeping – are also tightly coupled. To deal with daytime crying sessions, I devised a “terror threat level” system of graded responses, with passivation techniques such as singing, dancing, guitar and something I copied from
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCLp7zodUiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monty Python’s “Ministry of Silly Walks”</a>. For inducing sleep, I adopted similarly complex patterns of rocking, bouncing, walking, singing, shushing and waiting. Some of these patterns involved a Swiss ball – a large, inflated exercise ball that serves as a rocking chair for the 21st century. This ball has harmonic degrees of freedom in the side-to-side and front-to-back directions as well as the primary up-and-down one, and is essential for bouncing and rocking a baby to sleep. In addition, it is good for the physicist-parent’s core strength, and can be easily deflated and packed up before relocating for yet another postdoc.</p><p>Once the baby is asleep, the physicist-parent is faced with the challenge of escaping the room – in my case over creaky hardwood floors. Doing this before my daughter realizes she is asleep requires knowledge of the “path of least noise”. Once I have exited the room, though, I have a dilemma. No sounds come from the crib. Is my daughter asleep or awake? A measurement is required. As I silently slide on my socks into the dark room, my measurement wakes her and her original state remains unknown. This is Schrödinger’s baby.</p><p><strong>My time at home</strong> has been a great period in my life and I know I will miss this when I’m back at work. As I write this essay in my head, my daughter rests on my shoulder. Her breathing turns to snoring and I synchronize my own breathing to be in phase with hers. Together we plan all the things I need to do during her naptime. I definitely don’t have time for a nap of my own.</p><hr><p><img src="https://smalldata.dev/images/baby_physics/author_muse.jpeg" alt="author and muse">

December 10, 2020 | https://iteachproductandgrowth.com/p/what-is-product-management | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://iteachproductandgrowth.com/p/what-is-product-management">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This topic has been about written extensively. I first drafted this for a company I was consulting as they were getting their product management function into place for the first time and wanted help understanding the exact role of a product manager. I recently looked at it again and have made some updates and edits based on some additional years of work and leadership.</p><p>It is based on 16 years as both a product manager and a product leader and my observations of the common characteristics of the best product managers.</p><p>After writing it, I realized it sounds quite a bit like Ben Horowitz's Good PM, Bad PM essay from years back, so I'm linking it here to be clear I had no intention of stealing the concepts from that post (although I did write it independently and realized how similar it was after reading it).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/wp-content/uploads/Good_Product_Manager_Bad_Product_Manager_KV.pdf">Good PM, Bad PM</a></p><p><strong>What is product management:</strong></p><p>I view product management as the embodiment of the business, the customer, and the technical side of the company. It’s your responsibility to balance across all the stakeholders and make sure that you are the person pushing the product and the business forward.</p><p>Product managers should be a jack of all trades. They have the ability to pull data, do some basic wireframes, make quick insights from data, they can be involved in technical discussion at a high level, they can help the engineering team make tradeoffs. Product managers plug the holes in the team boat to keep it sailing towards the destination. They take on the tasks and work that no one else on the team can do in order to facilitate great outcomes for the team and business.</p><p>Their job is to push the engineers to get things done, but not just by urging them. It’s by working alongside them to help them make the best tradeoffs, to prevent them from getting caught up in an engineering challenge that isn’t important, and by focusing them on the customer. It’s also your job to shield them from bullshit (meetings, random requests, random thoughts, etc).</p><p>Product management is a key thought partner for design. We work together with design to understand the customer and the need we are solving as a business. But good product managers don't let design go crazy. Building software is not an art project, and we are not painting the Mona Lisa. We are here to deliver functional and great software to users, but that comes with constraints and tradeoffs. It's often the job of a PM to rein in and re-focus the design team on what matters and to get them to sit with engineering to understand tradeoffs.</p><p><strong>The most valuable resource you have is hands on keyboard time from your engineering team,</strong> and you should be striving to maximize it everyday. If your engineers are working a theoretical 8 hour day and more than 1-2 hours is not being spent coding (in meetings, meeting with management, doing other things) you are not doing your job as a product manager. Your job is to make the requirements crystal clear, the priorities clear, and then clear a path for your team to get it's work done.</p><p>As you grow as a PM, you run your product team the same way. You protect them and foster in them the idea that it’s their job to get shit done, to own their metrics, and to find a way to ship when the odds are against. And you hold them to that standard - you are constantly questioning a bit below the surface to understand the tradeoffs they are making and helping them think through the right way to motivate the team, make the correct tradeoffs, and manage effectively to constantly iterate and get things done.</p><p><strong>Product managers should be the best at politics at the company.</strong> You should be best friends with everyone who can help you get your code shipped and your product delivered. Don’t make enemies with engineering, with QA, or with design, instead be the bigger person and be ok apologizing because it gives you the upper hand in the relationship and the ability to ask them for favors and speed later.</p><p>I've seen great Product Managers ruined by holding a grudge with a critical stakeholder at organizations. Don't let this happen - find a way to re-establish the relationship, even if it means you have to apologize for something you don't necessarily think is your fault.</p><p><strong>Empathy is your friend as a PM</strong> - learn to embrace it and leave your emotions at the door. You don’t want the QA or engineering manager holding up your deployment at the 11th hour because they’ve picked you as a target for some random issue they want to bring up. You want to be the PM who takes them out to drinks and who they rely on so that when your code is coming in late, they support you and make the release happen.</p><p>You also need to be adept at managing upper management. You want them involved, but not too involved. Enough that the leadership team has confidence in you and your ability to get things done. But you don't want them constantly questioning when the next release is, looking at wireframes, reading requirements. It's up to you to strike the balance so that they have trust in your ability to do your job.</p><p><strong>Good product managers don’t need project managers.</strong> They manage the project and roadmap on their own. In fact, in a well functioning organization, it’s increasingly unclear to me what a project manager actually does (this does not include companies with cross-platform multi-dependencies, just teams that are trying to ship and get things done on time).</p><p><strong>Good product managers know their customers.</strong> And they understand the customer, either because they understand the data, or they talked to the customer, or they know the space or all of the above. They should have all of these skills, but I find that most PMs specialize in 1 or 2. It’s ok to be a bit more data centric, but you need to be able to balance that with understanding what the user is saying to you.</p><p><strong>They understand how they impact operations and marketing.</strong> They also improve these organizations by figuring out the technology solutions they can deliver and then by making them happen. For example, if you are a trusted person for optimizing marketing landing pages, for making the marketing spend more effective, or for driving conversion up throughout the funnel, you will want to improve the tooling and ease of optimizing these parts of the product. It's not efficient to have to manually deploy a new landing page every time your marketing or operations partner needs it done.</p><p><strong>Product managers can and should be metrics driven.</strong> They should not be driven solely by grand ideas or visions - those can be the basis for their original thinking, but at the end of the day, they need to actually find a way to get things done when it doesn’t seem easy and drive their metrics and the business forward. A good product manager can take the product vision and translate it into a metric that will demonstrate if the feature or optimization is having the expected impact.</p><p>The takeaway of all of this is that a great product manager is generally someone who has a wide skillset. You need to wear many hats, you need to be able to tackle lots of unforeseen problems, you need to be a strong writer, speaker, and creative thinker. You need to influence even though people don't report to you. It's a hard job, <a href="https://barronernst.com/so-you-want-to-be-a-product-manager/">there's no perfect background for it</a>, and you need to find ways to strongly move the organization forward to make an impact.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Ransomware – A Devastating Form of Digital Extortion]]>

December 10, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/11 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/11">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We live in a digital era where the most precious commodity no longer is oil or gold, but data. But what if this data, including personal files, customer lists and company data, flight traffic information, or even sensitive hospital records were stolen? What would you do, or pay, to get it back?</p>
</section><article><section><p>Ransomware has been on the rise the past years, where criminals effectively take all the data on your computer hostage and demand a ransom to give it back to you. Refusing to pay may result in your data being lost permanently. </p>
<p>Everyone is a potential target for ransomware, including single individuals, small to large companies, and even public institutions. A disconcerting trend is the targeting of hospitals and the public sector. Only last year the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles was <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/02/18/california-hospital-ransomware-attack-hackers/">attacked by ransomware</a>, blocking the company’s access to their own network and crucial patient data for 10 whole days. The hospital ended up paying the ransom of $17 000 in bitcoin to decrypt the data. </p>
<p>The demands have also increased drastically the last few years, where the <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/q2-2020-ransomware-marketplace-report">average ransom payment</a> having increased to an exorbitant $178 000 in Q2 of 2020. Some bigger companies also receive very high demands. For instance, Garmin was attacked in 2020 with an initial ransom demand of $10 million, which some <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/confirmed-garmin-received-decryptor-for-wastedlocker-ransomware/">sources</a> claim they chose to pay. And this does not include the costs of other factors such as downtime, loss of revenue, mistrust from consumers, and resources used to get everything up and running again. </p>
<p>Clearly, ransomware is a growing problem with an increase in both attacks and in the ransom demands themselves, as well as the targeting of sectors with the possible consequence of directly endangering lives. </p>
<p>But how to the criminals make their attacks so successful, either forcing a victim to pay or having to accept the loss of their data? The main principle of ransomware is that attackers will encrypt all the files rendering them unreadable, and only by buying the key to decrypt the files will they be accessible again. The first step to achieve this, is to obtain access to a computer or network in order to install the ransomware. </p>
<h2>How does ransomware get installed on my computer?</h2>
<p>Ransomware is a type of malware, which is a malicious piece of software that installs itself without permission on someone’s computer or even an organization’s whole system. The most common ways the attackers get access to your computer are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phishing – a cyber-attack imitating a trusted source, where an employee or private person is tricked into installing the malware without knowing it. This can be through clicking a link or downloading an attachment in a seemingly legit email.</li>
<li>Drive by downloads – visiting compromised websites that then installs the malware on your computer.</li>
<li>Security vulnerabilities – if systems are not up to date and are known to have weaknesses, then attackers will exploit these to install their malware. </li>
</ol>
<h2>How does ransomware encrypt my files?</h2>
<p>Once the ransomware is installed, it encrypts all the data on your computer. Unfortunately, the encryption methods used now are so complex that it is unfeasible to decrypt the files without the decryption key, which is known only to the attackers. To achieve a secure encryption of your data, the attackers use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption. </p>
<h4>Symmetric encryption</h4>
<p>One of the oldest ciphers in history is the shift cipher, which shifts each letter a set number of times back or forth in the alphabet. Knowing this set number, also referred to as the “key”, is therefore enough to both encrypt and decrypt a text. Julius Caesar was believed to use a shift cipher, substituting each letter with the one 3 spaces to the right. This is one of the simplest examples of a symmetric encryption. </p>
<p>Today, there are more advanced versions, which can be broadly categorized as block ciphers (encrypts in byte-sized blocks) or stream ciphers (encrypts single digits). These methods are fast and only require the same key to encrypt and decrypt. </p>
<h4>Asymmetric encryption</h4>
<p>Asymmetric encryption is slower and uses two keys instead of one: one public and one private. The private key is only in the possession of the key pair owner, whereas the public one is widely distributed. When using the public key to encrypt a message it can only be decrypted using the private key, and vice versa.  </p>
<h4>Ransomware take advantage of both encryption methods.</h4>
<p>One of the most common ways a ransomware takes over your computer, is through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the ransomware is installed on a computer, it comes with an asymmetric public key, which it used to establish contact with the attackers’ server. All communication is encrypted using this asymmetric encryption, making it impossible to intercept and interpret the communication between the affected computer and the server. </li>
<li>The ransomware will then request a new asymmetric public key from the server, which is specific for the victim’s computer (making it impossible to share a key with other victims). </li>
<li>Once received, the ransomware also creates a symmetric key, which quickly encrypts all the files. </li>
<li>The symmetric key is then encrypted using the asymmetric key specific to the victim. This means that only the private key on the attackers’ server can be used to unlock the symmetric key, which again will decrypt all the files. </li>
</ol>
<p>This makes the whole process fast and yet very secure, and almost impossible to decrypt without paying the ransom. </p>
<h2>Victims of ransomware</h2>
<p>Originally, ransomware was used to target individuals, with a low enough ransom so most people would choose to pay. While individuals are still affected, organizations are targeted on a more regular basis, and can offer a more lucrative pay-off if successful. In fact, <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/12/the-state-of-ransomware-2020/">one study</a> showed that over half of the companies had been subjected to a ransomware attack in the past year, and that 73% of these attacks were successful. A recent trend also shows an increase in attacks targeting <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/politics/hospitals-targeted-ransomware-attacks/index.html">government institutions and hospitals</a>.  </p>
<h2>Costs and solutions</h2>
<p>An estimate shows that total ransom demands will reach a staggering <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-20-billion-usd-by-2021/">20 billion USD by 2021</a>. </p>
<p>While paying the ransom is strongly discouraged as it helps create a marked for extorting money in this manner, some still choose to pay the ransom to retrieve their data. One recent <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/12/the-state-of-ransomware-2020/">study</a> of 5000 IT people showed that about 26% chose to pay and that of these, 95% did actually get the decryption key needed to unlock their files again. Over half chose not to pay and instead used backups of their data, while the rest used other methods.</p>
<p>However, even though paying up may seem like the best way to get things restored again, it may actually double the costs of being affected. All organizations attacked by ransomware had a high cost due to downtime, network costs, lost opportunity etc. even without paying the ransom. In fact, the authors of this <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2020/05/12/the-state-of-ransomware-2020/">study</a> argue that the organizations that chose to pay  had the same costs as those who did not with getting their systems back online, except they also had the cost of removing the encryption in addition to their other expenses.</p>
<p>As most attacks are successful and as it is nearly impossible to decrypt your files after an attack, it’s best to try and prevent an attack in the first place. Good strategies include having regular and off-site backup of data, installing anti-ransomware on your system, training employees in recognizing phishing, and closing any technological vulnerabilites that could be exploited. Stay tuned for more on this and other good preventative measure in our next article.</p></section></article></div>]]>

        <small>2020-12-09</small>
        <p>I generally don’t track startup news and financing rounds closely but it filters in because I enjoy tech. And these two Elixir-based companies made a blip on my radar recently with their successful rounds. So why not. Let’s be a little bit business.</p>
<p>So I don’t particularly love the VC-backed model of building businesses. It sort of makes sense for some types of endeavors but generally I’m an organic growth and small teams kind of person. I’ve been in a fast-growing small startup and have the scars to prove it. I’ve also seen good and bad examples of how these kinds of startups can work. Startups that can work at a sustainable pace basically mostly feel like any other company and are fine. Startups that are under fire or in financial panic are generally rough to work inside of. Not my type of business to run and own these days but highly relevant to our sector and Elixir is quite popular in the startup space, as it took on the mantle of Ruby’s successor.</p>
<p>I don’t know either of these companies intimately. I basically just found out about <a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/">Boulevard</a>, I might have heard the name before but not sure. <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> I know as an occasional gamer and community participant, they’re huge of course. These companies are at different scales and with different levels of name recognition I dare say. But they both build on Elixir and have done so since fairly early on. They both also seem to be killing it as they say in the biz. I think, I’m only tangentially in any biz.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/discord-is-close-to-closing-a-round-that-would-value-the-company-at-up-to-7b">Discord is close to closing a round with a $7B valuation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.joinblvd.com/blog/boulevard-series-b-financing">Boulevard closed a $27 million Series B</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these are serious money. Different levels of serious but either way, quite serious. I’ve written a little bit about <a href="https://underjord.io/elixir-as-competitive-advantage.html">Elixir as a competitive advantage</a> and this just adds some good sauce on top of that.</p>
<p>And I do believe the technology choice has given these companies a genuine advantage. Let’s pontificate.</p>
<p>Discord’s use-case is so very closely mapped to telecom needs that it’s almost absurd. They do calls and chat, presence and soft real-time. So building on something with the backing of Erlang and the BEAM, straight out of Ericsson, probably fit pretty much perfectly.</p>
<p>Boulevard’s case isn’t as clear to me. I think they are closer to the startup that would have defaulted to Rails a bunch of years back. So what this tells me (my sample size is like 6+) is that whatever Rails brought to the table Elixir seems to be matching. They actually had a Sean Stavropoulos on the Elixir Talk podcast that just resurfaced to talk. And he called out the lower memory usage on Heroku and a bunch of other sweet stuff. Good listen I thought. Their use-case is not as clear because they aren’t necessarily connecting calls and sending audio, doing lots of real-time stuff and all that. They might be but their business model would likely not demand it. To me this strengthens the image of Phoenix and Elixir covering the 80-90% use-case. Which is even more important.</p>
<p>As I’ve been prone to claiming. I think Elixir allows you to build better solutions. It gives you an exceedingly powerful baseline if you treat it like any other high-level language with a web framework. But you have enormous headroom to build systems that are a nightmare to build in languages with a similar expressiveness. The trade-offs you currently make with Elixir are things that place the language and runtime squarely in the space of building distributed services. I wouldn’t use it for a CLI application because of startup time (though Lumen might fix that), I wouldn’t use it for a mobile app because it doesn’t really fit (Lumen might help there, but I don’t expect it to). But I mostly build services. And there it just allows me to do more with less. Less hardware, less dependencies, less complexity. And it gives more. More guarantees, more clarity, more consistency and more reliability.</p>

If you want more of my writing I have a newsletter where I write on similar topics but perhaps more ephemerally and more experimental stuff. You’ll find a signup thing in the footer.</p>

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis.

Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist. He said it's important for doctors who could eventually prescribe psychedelics to be well versed in their effects.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Dr. Sean O'Sullivan is one of 16 health professionals who has been granted an exemption from Canada's drug laws to use magic mushrooms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Sean O'Sullivan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"You would not expect a guide to take any journey over any terrain with&nbsp;which the guide was not familiar. When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Here's a trick to get more out of your technical classes: use Mathematica on the homework.</p><p>I notice something weird about the psets at MIT. People spend 30 seconds thinking about a problem before looking it up on Slader. But then they're willing to spend 30 minutes bashing out the resulting algebra.</p><p>This happened to me when I took mechanics. I spent lots time filling up pristine printer paper with algebra and calculus to isolate some variable, but almost none thinking about the principles, structures, and rules that governed the problems. [1]</p><p>These days, I think about a problem until I'm happy with the setup. Then I plug the equations into Mathematica, write "using Mathematica," and circle the answer. This takes about a minute. Usually I lose half a point for not showing my work, which I accept gladly. </p><p>So it's obvious that using Mathematica is faster than doing the computation by hand. But is it better?</p><p>If you care about being good at the underlying subject, then it is. The three hours you save with Mathematica gives you three hours to think about the intuition and implications of the problem itself. Being fluent in Mathematica allows you to deal with any problem you find interesting, now or in the future, and not just the easily-integrable ones in the book. And once you have a problem in Mathematica, it's way easier to play with it and build real intuition for how things like it behave.</p><p>Using Mathematica will cause your computational abilities to rot. That's fine. At first, it will feel really uncomfortable, almost like you're cheating. But remember, purpose of Physics I is to teach you physics, not to make you practice integration. And last I checked, everyone forgets how to do integration by the time they're 30 anyway. You don't feel bad about putting multiplication into a calculator, and you shouldn't feel bad about putting a system of equations into one either.</p><p>I'm not saying to always use Mathematica. If the problem asks for the determinant of M, don't put <code>Det[M]</code> into Mathematica and copy down the answer. In other words, don't use Mathematica to get around the purpose of doing a problem. But when computation is not the core of the problem, Mathematica is great.</p><p>When you start using Mathematica, getting the answers will be slow and distracting. That's to be expected: you'll pay a steep penalty at the beginning. But over time you'll come to understand the quirks and the power of Mathematica, and it will fade into the background, much like your TI-84.</p><p>Without the algebraic mess, the underlying subject often seems more beautiful.</p><h3 id="notes">Notes</h3><p>This essay is structured like <em>Write Like You Talk,</em> as part of a project to impose more rigor on my writing style.</p><p>[1]: This is a confusion between what's tractable and what's important. Doing algebra is tractable but unimportant, whereas gaining intuition for a problem is important but feels intractable. (Where do you even start?)</p>

<p>November 2020</p>
<p>(Click <a href="#list">here</a> to go straight to the list.)</p>

<div id="blockquote">
    <div><p><em>â€œI certainly understand the value of knowing key ideas from different disciplines and building my own latticework, but I didnâ€™t learn any of that in school, and Iâ€™d be starting from ground zero."</em></p><p>
        Charlie Munger, quoted in Robert Hagstrom's <em>Investing: The Last Liberal Art</em>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Familiarity with the great works has moral, civic, social, economic, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">progress-related</a> benefits. Taken together, they give a fair history of humanity's inventing, improving, and imagining.</p>

<p>You can probably skip 99.9% of all books. You can read them (to borrow Mortimer Adler's idea) for knowledge or for entertainment, but the books that truly matter likely number only in the few hundred, and not more than a thousand. These are the books, as Adler says, that <em>grow with you</em>, as time goes on. These are the books that have much to teach us on philosophy, science, and living a good life. These are great books.</p>

<p>They form the basis of the humanities, and of a classic liberal arts education. Reading them helps you cheat, as it were, and get ideas and wisdom from other people.</p>

<p>This project has two underlying theories: first, everything in life is about communication, and reading great books improves your ability to think, speak, and write. Being able to articulate your position is a necessary element of leadership. Second, these books are, as Jordan Peterson put it, the intellectual ancestors of many of the great ideas today -- ideas like democracy or how to live a good life. One can debate the Bible's veracity, but not its influence.</p>
    

<p>This project has two inspirations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Graham Allison and Niall Fergon's idea of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">"Applied History,"</a> and
    </li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi">Daf Yomi</a>, the Jewish tradition in which people read the (roughly) 2,700 pages of the Babylonian Talmud in (roughly) seven-and-a-half years.
</li></ul>

<h3>The plan:</h3>
<p>To read around 150 classic works in the next four years, one year per topic of: antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Enlightenment, and modernity. (Each year also has a couple of "wild card" books to avoid burning out.)</p>

<p>Apache Spark is a perfect fit for processing large amounts of data. It’s not,&nbsp;
however, a perfect fit for our language stack at
<a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>. We are largely an Elixir shop with a solid
amount of Go, while Spark’s native stack is Scala but also has a Python API.
We’re not JVM people so we use the Python API—via the Databricks platform. For
most of our work, that’s just fine. But, what happens when you want to write a
custom user defined function (UDF) to do some heavy lifting? We could write new
code in Python, or… we could use our existing Go libraries to do the job! This
means we have to wrap up our Go code into a jar file that can be loaded into the
classpath for the Spark job. This is how to do that.</p>

<p>(Note that everything below could equally apply to UDAFs—aggregate functions)</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-do-this-crazy-thing">Why Did You Do This Crazy Thing?</h2>

<p>You might be wondering how well this works. To put that issue to rest: it works
well and has been effective for us. That being established, let’s talk about
our use case. We have a large amount of data stored in a binary container
format that wraps Protobuf records, stored on AWS S3. Spark is great with S3,
but cannot natively read these files. Complicating things further, schemas for
the Protobuf records need to be kept up to date for all the tools that process
this data in anything but the most trivial way.</p>

<p>Over time we have built a set of battle-tested Go libraries that work on this
data. Furthermore, we already maintain tooling to keep the Protobuf schemas and
Go libraries up to date. It seems natural to leverage all of that goodness in
our Spark jobs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Battle-tested libs that have been in production for awhile, with good tests.</li>
  <li>We already manage pipelines to keep the schemas up to date for the Go libs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the tradeoffs of reimplementing those libraries and the CI jobs, or
wrapping Go code up into jar files for use as Spark UDFs, we did the sane
thing!</p>

<h2 id="spark-udfs">Spark UDFs</h2>

<p>Spark is flexible and you can customize your jobs to handle just about any
scenario. One of the most re-useable ways to work with data in Spark is <a href="https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/content/spark-sql-udfs.html">user
defined functions
(UDFs)</a>.
These can be called directly inside Spark jobs or Spark SQL. In our case we use
a UDF to transform our custom binary input and Protobuf into something that
Spark more easily understands: JSON.</p>

<p>This means we can do something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pyspark.sql.functions</span> <span>as</span> <span>F</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pyspark.sql.types</span> <span>as</span> <span>T</span>

<span>)</span>

<span>)</span>

<span># Continue working with the dataframe</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By transforming the data into JSON, we get to work on something that is much
more native to Spark than Protobuf. Because we use the libraries that are
already maintained with up to date bindings, we don’t have to manage that
inside Spark itself. We only have to update our UDF in the jar loaded by the
job.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-spark-udf-in-go">Building a Spark UDF in Go</h2>

<p>Before we look too hard at anything else we need to get Go code into a wrapper that
lets us call it from Java. Then we’ll need to write a little Java glue to wrap
the Go code into the right types to make Spark happy when calling it. Luckily,
for this use case it’s all pretty simple.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-go-code-into-a-java-library">Wrapping Go Code Into a Java Library</h3>

<p>First, we need some Go code to wrap. The library we talked about was built for
one purpose, but we need a little wrapper function to do just the part we need
to call from Spark. In our case we’ll take a single value from Spark and return
a single value back. Both of those values will be of type <code>[]byte</code> which makes
things really simple going between Go and Java, where this type interchanges
easily. I made a file called <code>spark_udf.go</code> that looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span></span><span>package</span> <span>eventdecoder</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>"bytes"</span>
        <span>"compress/gzip"</span>
        <span>"io/ioutil"</span>

        <span>"github.com/company/yourlib"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>Decode</span><span>(</span><span>data</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>zReader</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>gzip</span><span>.</span><span>NewReader</span><span>(</span><span>bytes</span><span>.</span><span>NewReader</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>))</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// We return an error as the body!</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>uncompressedData</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>ioutil</span><span>.</span><span>ReadAll</span><span>(</span><span>zReader</span><span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// We return an error as the body!</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>yourlib</span><span>.</span><span>DoSomeWork</span><span>(</span><span>uncompressedData</span><span>)</span> 

        <span>// Handle errors, etc</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>bytes</span><span>.</span><span>Join</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>"\n"</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we have that, we need to get it into a jar file with all the bindings
that will let Java call into the Go function. As part of the <code>gomobile</code> efforts
to integrate Go with Android, there are some tools that will handle two way
wrappers between Java and Go.
<a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gobind"><code>gobind</code></a> will generate Java
bindings for exported functions in a Go module. You could start there and build
up the necessary tools to make this work. Sadly, it’s not at all trivial to get
it into a shape that will build nicely.</p>

<p>After messing around with it for awhile, I found a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/sridharv/gojava"><code>gojava</code></a> that wraps all the hard parts
from gobind into a single, easy to use tool. It’s not perfect: it does not
appear to be under active development, and does not support Go modules. But, it
makes life so much easier, and because none of this stuff changes that often,
the lack of active development isn’t much of a hindrance here. The ease of use
makes it worth it for us. Getting a working Java jar file is a single step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span><span>JAVA_HOME</span><span>=</span>&lt;your_java_home&gt; <span>\</span>
        <span>GO111MODULE</span><span>=</span>off <span>\</span>
        gojava -v -o <span>`</span><span>pwd</span><span>`</span>/eventdecoder.jar build github.com/&lt;your_module_path&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will generate a file called <code>eventdecoder.jar</code> that contains your Go code
and the Java wrappers to call it. Great, right? If you are using Go modules,
just use <code>go mod vendor</code> before running <code>gojava</code> to make sure that you have all
your dependencies in a form that <code>gojava</code> can handle.</p>

<h3 id="adding-the-right-interface">Adding the Right Interface</h3>

<p>But we are not done yet. The Go code in the jar we built does not have the
right interface for a Spark UDF. So we need a little code to wrap it. You could
do this in Scala, but for us Java is more accessible, so I used that. Spark
UDFs can take up to 22 arguments and there are different interfaces defined for
each set of arguments, named <code>UDF1</code> through <code>UDF22</code>. In our case we only want
one input: the raw binary. So that means we’ll use the <code>UDF1</code> interface. Here’s
what the Java wrapper looks like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span></span><span>package</span> <span>com.community.EventsUDF</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>org.apache.spark.sql.api.java.UDF1</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>go.eventdecoder.Eventdecoder</span><span>;</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>implements</span> <span>UDF1</span><span>&lt;</span><span>byte</span><span>[],</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>private</span> <span>static</span> <span>final</span> <span>long</span> <span>serialVersionUID</span> <span>=</span> <span>1L</span><span>;</span>

        <span>@Override</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>call</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span><span>[]</span> <span>input</span><span>)</span> <span>throws</span> <span>Exception</span> <span>{</span>
				<span>// Call our Go code</span>

        <span>}</span>

<p>We stick that in our path following the expected Java layout. So if
<code>spark_udf.go</code> is in the current directory, below it we put the above files in
<code>java/com/community/EventsUDF/Decoder.java</code>. Note that this needs to match your
package name inside the Java source file.</p>

<h3 id="assembling-it">Assembling It</h3>

<p>We’re almost there! But, we need the Spark jar files that we’ll compile this
against. Our project has a <code>Makefile</code> (which I’ll share at the end of this
post) that downloads the correct jars and sticks them in <code>./spark_jars</code>. With
those being present, we can compile the Java code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span>javac -cp <span>\</span>
	spark_jars/spark-core_<span>$(</span>VERSION<span>)</span>.jar:eventdecoder.jar:spark_jars/spark-sql_<span>$(</span>VERSION<span>)</span>.jar <span>\</span>
	java/com/community/EventsUDF/Decoder.java</code></pre></figure>

<p>With that compiled we can just add it to our Jar file and we’re ready to go!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span><span>cd</span> java <span>&amp;&amp;</span> jar uf ../eventdecoder.jar com/community/EventsUDF/*.class</code></pre></figure>

<p>That will update the jar file qnd insert our class. You can load that up into
Spark and call it as shown at the start of this post.</p>

<h2 id="important-notes">Important Notes</h2>

<p>You need to build this for the architecture where you will run your Spark job!
Spark may be in Scala, and we may have wrapped this stuff up into a Java jar,
but the code inside is still native binary. You may have some success with
<code>GOOS</code> and <code>GOARCH</code> settings, but it has not been repeatable for us with
<code>gojava</code>. We’ve built our UDFs that we use on Databricks’ platform under Ubuntu
18.04 with Go 1.14 and they work great.</p>

<p>Another gotcha that <a href="https://github.com/andrijaa">Aki Colović</a> found when
working with this stuff, is that your Go package <em>cannot contain an underscore</em>
or it makes the Java class loader unhappy. So don’t do that.</p>

<h2 id="a-makefile-to-make-it-simpler">A Makefile to Make it Simpler</h2>

<p>There were a few finicky steps above and this needs to be repeatable. So, I
built a <code>Makefile</code> to facilitate these UDF builds. It does all the important
steps in one go. As you will see below, we have cached the right versions of
the Spark jars in S3, but you can pull them from wherever you like. If you are
into Java build tools, feel free to use those.</p>

<p>The <code>Makefile</code> I wrote looks like this. You will likely have to make little
changes to make it work for you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Being pulled into the garage to help my father work on cars was a constant threat throughout my childhood. During these sessions, I was subjected to countless automotive adages, none of which resonated more than this:</p><blockquote><p>The car was designed to be built on an assembly line.</p></blockquote><p>Once this idea is internalized, all kinds of oddities underneath the hood start to make sense. It builds the instinct to keep that 10mm wrench within reach because the factory would have prioritized tooling costs over using more appropriately sized bolts for the wire harness. It delivers that “a-ha” realization to remove the front-left wheel to service the battery. Truth be told, if it weren’t for this adage, I wouldn’t have been able to keep my temper under control when I had to rip out the entire dashboard just to replace the heater core in my beloved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Thunderbird_%28tenth_generation%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ford Thunderbird</a>!</p><p>Many of the Fords I worked on owe their market success to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">W. Edwards Deming</a>, an electrical engineer turned process-management guru. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pragmatist</a>, Deming believed that <strong>without theory, there is no learning</strong>. To illustrate his point, he told a story about a rooster:</p><blockquote><p>The barnyard rooster Chanticleer had a theory. He crowed every morning, putting forth all his energy, flapped his wings. The sun came up.</p><p>The connexion <em>[sic]</em> was clear: His crowing caused the sun to come up; there was no question about his importance. There came a snag. He forgot one morning to crow. The sun came up anyhow. Crestfallen, he saw his theory in need of revision. <em>[1]</em></p></blockquote><p>But we’re not rummaging for faulty gaskets (or contemplating orbital mechanics). Management has pulled us – not into a garage, but a “war room,” tasking us with closing an incident ticket for an unfamiliar codebase. Our mindset is one of survival. I missed so many car lessons throughout the years because of this attitude – let’s not repeat my mistake despite these similar conditions!</p><p>Instead of solely focusing on patching and getting back to our routine, let’s approach this unfamiliar codebase with some theories. If our predictions are correct, we’ll find the bug faster and put out a more comprehensive fix. If wrong, our egos may be bruised, but we’ll learn. Even if the lessons themselves aren’t relevant to our projects, at least we’ll have better theories for the next time management yanks us back into that war room.</p><p>While car engineers must make concessions for quick assembly, they also tailor the factories doing the manufacturing. Thanks to predictive planning, Subaru employees know everything each step needs, not just the tools and raw materials, but also the amount of time. This knowledge gives Subaru management the framework required to set deadlines throughout the company, keeping things flowing from procurement to delivery. Unfortunately, when the managers of software engineers habitually apply predictive planning to the world of software, everything falls apart:</p><blockquote><p>Predictive planning requires known duration tasks. This means that the more unknown duration tasks there are in a work flow, the more predictive planning breaks down. Software projects have a high percentage of unknown duration tasks in the form of research tasks. These research tasks are often left unfinished due to the the team being focused on delivering Something™ by the predictive planning calculated date, rather than delivering valuable software when it is ready. <em><a href="https://iism.org/article/is-management-pressuring-you-to-deliver-unfinished-code-59" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Because modern business is built on deadlines, I’d like to recommend an adage when approaching unfamiliar codebases:</p><blockquote><p>The source code evolved to survive its environment.</p></blockquote><p>Once internalized, all kinds of horrors become relatable. It suggests that the tuples map is duplicated because the developer didn’t have the time to ensure memory-safe concurrency. It delivers that “a-ha!” moment when we see that <em>all</em> config values are injected via environmental variables, and that the yaml file is a long-abandoned scrap of good intentions. And it helps us maintain sanity when an entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">god class</a> requires refactoring just to change the behavior of a single button.</p><p>To set ourselves up for success, let’s take a few moments to ask some questions and build theories on top of this adage before diving into the problematic codebase!</p><p><strong>Was the team’s manager a Java developer at one point in their career?</strong> Maybe the manager got involved in technical decisions, resulting in the use of that antiquated ORM library in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project#:~:text=In%20many%20disciplines%20a%20greenfield,of%20existing%20buildings%20or%20infrastructure." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">greenfield project</a>.</p><p><strong>Did the top sales rep want a customized theme used in every pitch?</strong> Maybe that’s why the theme system suffers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inner-platform effect</a>, and the CSS attributes are stored in a relational database.</p><p><strong>Was the inventory microservice originally meant to validate orders?</strong> Maybe that’s why the customer microservice has to pass along a shipping address to check if an item is in stock!</p><p>We can count on the consequences of predictive planning and the echos of work conditions to be lurking in the code. A few extra moments spent digging into the project’s history can give us the base we need to propose theories. When our theories are correct, we’ll produce better fixes, and when they’re wrong, we can learn lessons to both course-correct and apply to our projects.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li>[1] Deming WE 1994 ‘The New Economics: For Industry, Government, Education’ MIT Press: Massachusetts pp102-3</li><li>[2] Gandalf Hudlow 2020 <a href="https://iism.org/article/is-management-pressuring-you-to-deliver-unfinished-code-59" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">'Is management pressuring you to deliver unfinished code?'</a> iiSM.org (<a href="https://archive.is/wip/xs6WR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">archive link</a>)</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the core requirements of the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes networking model</a> is that every pod should get its own IP address and that every pod in the cluster should be able to talk to it using this IP address. There are several network providers (flannel, calico, canal, etc.) that implement this networking model.</p><p>As I started working on Kubernetes, it wasn’t completely clear to me how every pod is assigned an IP address. I understood how various components worked independently, however, it wasn’t clear how these components fit together. For instance, I understood what CNI plugins were, however, I didn’t know how they were invoked. So, I wanted to write this post to share what I have learned about various networking components and how they are stitched together in a kubernetes cluster for every pod to receive an IP address.</p><p>There are various ways of setting up networking in kubernetes and various options for a container runtime. For this post, I will use
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/flannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flannel</a> as the network provider and
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd</a> as the container runtime. Also, I am going to assume that you know how container networking works and only share a very brief overview below for context.</p><h2 id="some-background-concepts">Some Background Concepts</h2><h3 id="container-networking-a-very-brief-overview">Container Networking: A Very Brief Overview</h3><p>There are some really good posts explaining how container networking works. For context, I will go over a very high level overview here with a single approach that involves linux bridge networking and packet encapsulation. I am skipping details here as container networking deserves a blog post of itself. Some of the posts that I have found to be very educational in this space are
<a href="#container-networking">linked in the references below</a>.</p><h4 id="containers-on-the-same-host">Containers on the same host</h4><p>One of the ways containers running on the same host can talk to each other via their IP addresses is through a linux bridge. In the kubernetes (and docker) world, a
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veth (virtual ethernet)</a> device is created to achieve this. One end of this veth device is inserted into the container network namespace and the other end is connected to a
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linux bridge</a> on the host network. All containers on the same host have one end of this veth pair connected to the linux bridge and they can talk to each other using their IP addresses via the bridge. The linux bridge is also assigned an IP address and it acts as a gateway for egress traffic from pods destined to different nodes.
<img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/08/how-a-kubernetes-pod-gets-an-ip-address/bridge-networking.png" alt="bridge networking"></p><h4 id="containers-on-different-hosts">Containers on different hosts</h4><p>One of the ways containers running on different hosts can talk to each other via their IP addresses is by using packet encapsulation. Flannel supports this through
<a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-vxlan-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vxlan</a> which wraps the original packet inside a UDP packet and sends it to the destination.</p><p>In a kubernetes cluster, flannel creates a vxlan device and some route table entries on each of the nodes. Every packet that’s destined for a container on a different host goes through the vxlan device and is encapsulated in a UDP packet. On the destination, the encapsulated packet is retrieved and the packet is routed through to the destined pod.
<img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/08/how-a-kubernetes-pod-gets-an-ip-address/flannel-networking.png" alt="flannel networking"></p><p><em>NOTE: This is just one of the ways how networking between containers can be configured.</em></p><h3 id="what-is-cri">What Is CRI?</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRI (Container Runtime Interface)</a> is a plugin interface that allows kubelet to use different container runtimes. Various container runtimes implement the CRI API and this allows users to use the container runtime of their choice in their kubernetes installation.</p><h3 id="what-is-cni">What is CNI?</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNI project</a> includes a
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spec</a> to provide a generic plugin-based networking solution for linux containers. It also consists of various
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plugins</a> which perform different functions in configuring the pod network. A CNI plugin is an executable that follows the CNI spec and we’ll discuss some plugins in the post below.</p><h2 id="assigning-subnets-to-nodes-for-pod-ip-addresses">Assigning Subnets To Nodes For Pod IP Addresses</h2><p>If all pods are required to have an IP address, it’s important to ensure that all pods across the entire cluster have a unique IP address. This is achieved by assigning each node a unique subnet from which pods are assigned IP addresses on that node.</p><h3 id="node-ipam-controller">Node IPAM Controller</h3><p>When <code>nodeipam</code> is passed as an option to the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kube-controller-manager’s</a> <code>--controllers</code> command line flag, it allocates each node a dedicated subnet (podCIDR) from the cluster CIDR (IP range for the cluster network). Since these podCIDRs are disjoint subnets, it allows assigning each pod a unique IP address.</p><p>A kubernetes node is assigned a podCIDR when the node first registers with the cluster. To change the podCIDR allocated to nodes in a cluster, nodes need to be de-registered and then re-registered with any configuration changes first applied to the kubernetes control plane. <code>podCIDR</code> for a node can be listed using the following command.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl get no &lt;nodeName&gt; -o json | jq '.spec.podCIDR'
10.244.0.0/24
</code></pre><h2 id="kubelet-container-runtime-and-cni-plugins---how-its-all-stitched-together">Kubelet, Container Runtime and CNI Plugins - how it’s all stitched together</h2><p>When a pod is scheduled on a node, a lot of things happen to start up a pod. In this section, I’ll only focus on the interactions that relate to configuring network for the pod.</p><p>Once a pod is scheduled on the node, the following interactions result in configuring the network and starting the application container.
<img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/08/how-a-kubernetes-pod-gets-an-ip-address/kubelet-cri-cni-flowchart.png" alt="kubelet-cri-cni-flowchart"></p><p>Ref:
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/v1.11.1/docs/architecture.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd cri plugin architecture</a></p><h2 id="interactions-between-container-runtime-and-cni-plugins">Interactions between Container Runtime and CNI Plugins</h2><p>Every network provider has a CNI plugin which is invoked by the container runtime to configure network for a pod as it’s started. With containerd as the container runtime,
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd CRI plugin</a> invokes the CNI plugin. Every network provider also has an agent that’s installed on each of the kubernetes node to configure pod networking. When the network provider agent is installed, it either ships with the CNI config or it creates one on the node which is then used by the CRI plugin to figure out which CNI plugin to call.</p><p>The location for the CNI config file is configurable and the default value is <code>/etc/cni/net.d/&lt;config-file&gt;</code>. CNI plugins need to be shipped on every node by the cluster administrators. The location for CNI plugins is configurable as well and the default value is <code>/opt/cni/bin</code>.</p><p>In case of containerd as the container runtime, path for CNI configuration and CNI plugin binaries can be specified under <code>[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".cni]</code> section of the
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/master/docs/config.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">containerd config</a>.</p><p>Since we are referring to Flannel as the network provider here, I’ll talk a little about how Flannel is set up. Flanneld is the Flannel daemon and is typically installed on a kubernetes cluster as a daemonset with <code>install-cni</code> as an
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml#L172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">init container</a>. The <code>install-cni</code> container creates the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ronaknnathani/957a56210bd4fbd8e11120273c6b4ede" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNI configuration file</a> - <code>/etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist</code> - on each node. Flanneld creates a vxlan device, fetches networking metadata from the apiserver and watches for updates on pods. As pods are created, it distributes routes for all pods across the entire cluster and these routes allow pods to connect to each other via their IP addresses. For details on how flannel works, I recommend the
<a href="#how-flannel-works">linked references below</a>.</p><p>The interactions between Containerd CRI Plugin and CNI plugins can be visualized as follows:
<img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/08/how-a-kubernetes-pod-gets-an-ip-address/kubelet-cri-cni-interactions.png" alt="kubelet-cri-cni-interactions"></p><p>As described above, kubelet calls the Containerd CRI plugin in order to create a pod and Containerd CRI plugin calls the CNI plugin to configure network for the pod. The network provider CNI plugin calls other base CNI plugins to configure the network. The interactions between CNI plugins are described below.</p><h3 id="interactions-between-cni-plugins">Interactions Between CNI Plugins</h3><p>There are various CNI plugins that help configure networking between containers on a host. For this post, we will refer to 3 plugins.</p><h4 id="flannel-cni-plugin">Flannel CNI Plugin</h4><p>When using Flannel as the network provider, the Containerd CRI plugin invokes the
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/meta/flannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flannel CNI plugin</a> using the CNI configuration file - <code>/etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist</code>.</p><pre><code>$ cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist
{
  "name": "cni0",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "type": "flannel",
      "delegate": {
		 "ipMasq": false,
        "hairpinMode": true,
        "isDefaultGateway": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre><p>The Fannel CNI plugin works in conjunction with Flanneld. When Flanneld starts up, it fetches the podCIDR and other network related details from the apiserver and stores them in a file - <code>/run/flannel/subnet.env</code>.</p><pre><code>FLANNEL_NETWORK=10.244.0.0/16 
FLANNEL_SUBNET=10.244.0.1/24
FLANNEL_MTU=1450 
FLANNEL_IPMASQ=false
</code></pre><p>The Flannel CNI plugin uses the information in <code>/run/flannel/subnet.env</code> to configure and invoke the bridge CNI plugin.</p><h4 id="bridge-cni-plugin">Bridge CNI Plugin</h4><p>Flannel CNI plugin calls the Bridge CNI plugin with the following configuration:</p><pre><code>{
  "name": "cni0",
  "type": "bridge",
  "mtu": 1450,
  "ipMasq": false,
  "isGateway": true,
  "ipam": {
    "type": "host-local",
    "subnet": "10.244.0.0/24"
  }
}
</code></pre><p>When
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/main/bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bridge CNI plugin</a> is invoked for the first time, it creates a linux bridge with the <code>"name": "cni0"</code> specified in the config file. For every pod, it then creates a veth pair - one end of the pair is in the container’s network namespace and the other end is connected to the linux bridge on the host network. With Bridge CNI plugin, all containers on a host are connected to the linux bridge on the host network.</p><p>After configuring the veth pair, Bridge plugin invokes the host-local IPAM CNI plugin. Which IPAM plugin to use can be configured in the CNI config CRI plugin uses to call the flannel CNI plugin.</p><h4 id="host-local-ipam-cni-plugins">Host-local IPAM CNI plugins</h4><p>The Bridge CNI plugin calls the
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/ipam/host-local" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host-local IPAM CNI plugin</a> with the following configuration:</p><pre><code>{
  "name": "cni0",
  "ipam": {
    "type": "host-local",
    "subnet": "10.244.0.0/24",
    "dataDir": "/var/lib/cni/networks"
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Host-local IPAM (IP Address Management) plugin returns an IP address for the container from the <code>subnet</code> and stores the allocated IP locally on the host under the directory specified under <code>dataDir</code> - <code>/var/lib/cni/networks/&lt;network-name=cni0&gt;/&lt;ip&gt;</code>. <code>/var/lib/cni/networks/&lt;network-name=cni0&gt;/&lt;ip&gt;</code> file contains the container ID to which the IP is assigned.</p><p>When invoked, the host-local IPAM plugin returns the following payload</p><pre><code>{
  "ip4": {
    "ip": "10.244.4.2",
    "gateway": "10.244.4.3"
  },
  "dns": {}
}

                        <p>Epistemic status: Making a stab at the ineffable. The ineffable dodges and I miss. Again, argh! It always does that. Oh well, gonna keep stabbing anyway.</p><hr><p>Hey kids, wassup. Wanna talk about <em>magic</em>? 'Course you do. First, a disclaimer: I don't advocate sorcery. Aleister Crowley et al may have been onto something, but I recommend against following that example, because you might <code><a href="https://linuxize.com/post/what-does-chmod-777-mean/#never-use-chmod-777">chmod 777</a></code> your brain and that would go poorly for you. (Oversimplifying, but I don't want to digress on demons right now.)</p><p>Second, a definition: Magic means changing how you move through the world such that it changes how the world flows around you. Using your intentions, intentionally, to alter reality. Remember, your intentions are already inside of reality; the surge and ebb cannot help but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect">radiate through the entire matrix</a>. Magic is doing that on purpose — willing your will <em>through</em> yourself to <em>beyond</em> yourself. And back again threefold, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Three_(Wicca)">according to the witches' adage</a>.</p><p>In my opinion, the mechanisms are fairly mundane, albeit in the sense that dissecting a frog will kill it. (Mercifully the scalpel is rarely seized before the frog is already dead.) Paying attention is the extraordinary part! Magic combines prosaic phenomena such as confirmation bias and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">frequency illusion</a> —&nbsp;together, synchronicity — to metamorphose your sensory-processing apparatus and the self that alchemically arises from it. Pareidolia is a <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1335444264218550272">feature, not a bug</a>. You can step into your own OODA loop, thus affecting the production of your mood, your energy, your vibe. Your whole being, the <em>that-which-is</em> that constitutes you.</p><p>Magic means taking advantage of internal recursion to simultaneously conduct and channel your desires. Unsurprisingly, the endeavor is dangerous, sometimes unto destruction —&nbsp;the spirit can be stretched and twisted into a snare, or a whip. Again, take care to safeguard read-write access. (And again, I'm oversimplifying, because any interaction with anything entails some degree of write access.)</p><p>The school of magic to which I devote myself is Christianity. Don't take this as a diminishment of the religion; I have faith. The Lord's Prayer, the Jesus Prayer, and the Hail Mary are powerful incantations. I'll write more about that in the future... today, briefly, I want to discuss gratitude. There are secular practices of gratitude, of course, which I know are also effective — for a long time I was an atheist and I still counted my blessings, and it still worked.</p><p>When you habitually think in certain ways, dwell on certain topics, that changes your brain. Physically — "neural pathways" or whatever the correct jargon may be. Repeatedly evoking gratitude in yourself carves grooves of goodness through your cognition. Actively seeking joy in your experiences is like strumming a harp over and over until the chord never ceases echoing in your heart.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">spells are a type of prayer and prayers are a type of spell; which category-notion supersedes is a matter of personal salience</p>— 🎀 sonyasupposedly.com 🤖 (@sonyasupposedly) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly/status/1337107671674015744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>From the most remote terrestrial wilderness to the most densely populated cities, humans are inexorably changing the planet. We have put 1 million species at risk of extinction, degraded soil and habitats, polluted the air and water, destroyed forests and coral reefs wholesale, exploited wild species, and fostered the proliferation of invasive species.&nbsp;And we have caused a global climate crisis.</p>



<p>This planetary neglect and mismanagement helped pave the way for the Covid-19 pandemic. Our disruption of natural ecosystems has led to escalating health crises, including an increase in zoonotic diseases that arise when pathogens pass between animals and humans. There is no excuse for humanity to have allowed this to happen, and even less excuse for us to allow it to happen again.</p>



<p>To prevent the next pandemic, and to address today’s many other health challenges, we must ensure the biological integrity of our planet for current and future generations. That means governments, and all of us, must work across disciplines and sectors of society not only to prevent, monitor, and reduce disease, but also to prioritize biodiversity conservation.</p>



<figure id="promo-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://undark.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cv19.png" width="80px"></td><td><br><em>For all of Undark’s coverage of the global Covid-19 pandemic, please visit our extensive <a href="https://sinapticas.com/covid19">coronavirus archive</a>.</em></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Thriving ecosystems provide the foundation for life, health, and wellbeing on our planet. The decline of species and the degradation of ecosystems, coupled with the increased encroachment of people and commercial activities into the planet’s remaining wild places, has provided more opportunities for disease to spill over from animals to humans on a global scale. In the case of Covid-19, scientists agree that a bat species from Asia was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01541-z">likely the ancestral host</a> of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. While the timing and place of the spillover are still unclear, the extensive commercial use of wildlife for human consumption and the fur trade have created human-wildlife interfaces that could have promoted the evolution of the virus and ultimately facilitated the transmission to humans.</p>



<p>On October 25, 2019, shortly before the emergence of Covid-19, the Wildlife Conservation Society, as part of a conference hosted&nbsp;by the government of Germany and attended by global health and conservation leaders, issued&nbsp;“<a href="https://oneworldonehealth.wcs.org/About-Us/Mission/The-2019-Berlin-Principles-on-One-Health.aspx" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The 2019 Berlin Principles on One Health</a>,”&nbsp;a call to promote ecosystem health and integrity while also addressing issues like climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and pandemic preparedness. It advocated for global stakeholders to take such actions as developing institutions that integrate understanding of human, animal, and environmental health; devising holistic approaches toward combatting disease that account for interconnections among species, ecosystems, and humans; increasing investment in human, livestock, wildlife, plant, and health infrastructure; and enhancing the capacity of health surveillance and information sharing to coordinate international responses.</p>



<p>In short, the “One Health” approach espoused in the Berlin principles acknowledges the inseparability of human, wildlife, and ecological health. It recognizes that, to achieve optimal health outcomes for all, we must have a collaborative, dynamic, and trans-disciplinary approach at all levels.</p>



<p>Failures in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic have likely made it harder to put the Berlin principles into place. Turns toward nationalism and isolationism, a simmering distrust in science, widespread disinformation, and a pervasive misperception that health and the environment are at odds with economic stability and human wellbeing are but some of the sociopolitical impediments to building a healthier planet.</p>



<p>But combatting the biodiversity, health, and climate crises is not a zero-sum game. It is vital that governments work collaboratively on all three fronts to prevent the next global pandemic. Urgent action must be taken to retain the essential health links between humans, wildlife, domesticated animals and plants, and all of nature. We must ensure the conservation and protection of biodiversity that, interwoven with intact and functional ecosystems, provides the foundational infrastructure of life, health, and well-being on our planet. A key element will be multilateral and multidisciplinary collaboration. No one country, group, discipline, or sector of society holds enough knowledge and resources to single-handedly prevent the emergence or spread of global diseases.</p>



<p>Last month, after a tumultuous year that followed the launch of the Berlin Principles, the Wildlife Conservation Society and German government reconvened — <a href="https://oneworldonehealth.wcs.org/OnePlanet-OneHealth-OneFuture-2020.aspx?_ga=2.119100937.1431903687.1605017483-1716010279.1580393456">this time virtually</a> — to discuss and identify what One Health might look like in practice and how best to put it to use. Speakers from Europe, North America, Asia, Latin America, and Africa were unified in their call to work across professions, disciplines, and sectors to strengthen the foundational role of biodiversity in human, animal, and environmental health. They were clear that, unless we fully embrace biodiversity conservation, we will not prevent the next pandemic of zoonotic origin.</p>



<p>Since the close of World War II, the global population has more than tripled to roughly 7.8 billion people, and the world has become increasingly interconnected. Globalization has brought tens of millions of people out of poverty and increased human lifespans and quality of life. However, greed, the destruction and exploitation of ecosystems, and indifference to the human and environmental consequences of these activities have paved the way for the current crises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the world recovers from Covid-19, business as usual cannot and should not be the order of the day. We can no longer ignore our interconnectedness with the ecosystems around us for the sake of narrow interests or short-term economic gains. We’ll need a new paradigm — one built around a global, integrated, multilateral, and all-inclusive approach to wellbeing. If we are to prevent the next pandemic, we’ll need One Health.</p>

  <p><em><strong>On December 16, 2020 Shipit! presents: Performance Tips from the Storefront Renderer Team.&nbsp;Celso and Maxime will share how the&nbsp;team optimized this Ruby application for the particular use case of serving storefront traffic. <a href="#Register">Please Register!</a></strong></em></p>
<p><strong>By Celso Dantas and Maxime Vaillancourt</strong></p>
<p>In the previous post about <a href="https://shopify.engineering/how-shopify-reduced-storefront-response-times-rewrite" target="_blank" title="How Shopify Reduced Storefront Response Times with a Rewrite" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">our new storefront rendering engine</a>, we described how we went about the rewrite process and smoothly transitioned to serve storefront requests with the new implementation. As a follow-up and based on readers’ comments and questions, this post dives deeper into the technical details of how we built the new storefront rendering engine to be faster than the previous implementation.</p>
<p>To set the table, let’s see how the new storefront rendering engine performs:</p>
<ul>
<li>It generates a response in less than ~45ms for 75% of storefront requests;</li>
<li>It generates a response in less than ~230ms for 90% of storefront requests;</li>
<li>It generates a response in less than ~900ms for 99% of storefront requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the new storefront rendering engine, the average storefront response is nearly 5x faster than with the previous implementation. Of course, how fast the rendering engine is able to process a request and spit out a response depends on two key factors: the shop’s Liquid theme implementation, and the number of resources needed to process the request. To get a better idea of where the storefront rendering engine spends its time when processing a request, try using the <a href="https://shopify.engineering/in-depth-liquid-render-analysis-shopify-theme-inspector-chrome-extension" target="_blank" title="How to Do an In-depth Liquid Render Analysis with Theme Inspector" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shopify Theme Inspector</a>: this tool will help you identify potential bottlenecks so you can work on improving performance in those areas.</p>
<figure><img alt="A data scheme diagram showing that the Storefront Renderer and Redis instance are contained in a Kubernetes node. The Storefront Renderer sends Redis data. The Storefront Renderer sends data to two sharded data stores outside of the Kubernetes node: Sharded MySQL and Sharded Redis" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-renderer-data-schema_c5f379b7-619f-4ddb-8064-d093550c4731.jpg?v=1607636250" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-renderer-data-schema_c5f379b7-619f-4ddb-8064-d093550c4731.jpg?v=1607636250">
<figcaption>A simplified data schema of the application</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before we cover each topic, let’s briefly describe our application stack. As mentioned in the previous post, the new storefront rendering engine is a Ruby application. It talks to a sharded MySQL database and uses Redis to store and retrieve cached data.</p>
<p>Optimizing how we load all that data is extremely important. As one of our requirements was to improve rendering time for Storefront requests. Here are some of the approaches that we took to accomplish that.</p>

<p>To reduce the number of network round trips to the database, we use <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/multi-statement.html" target="_blank" title="MySQL - 14.8.2 Multi-Statement" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MySQL’s multi-statement feature</a> to allow sending multiple queries at once. With a single request to the database, we can load data from multiple tables at once. Here’s a simplified example:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This request is especially useful to batch-load a lot of data very early in the response lifecycle based on the incoming request. After identifying the type of request, we trigger a single multi-statement query to fetch the data we need for that particular request in one go, which we’ll discuss later in this blog post. For example, for a request for a product page, we’ll load data for the product, its variants, its images, and other product-related resources in addition to information about the shop and the storefront theme, all in a single round-trip to MySQL.</p>

<p>As shown above, the new storefront rendering engine uses handcrafted, optimized SQL queries. This allows us to easily write fine-tuned SQL queries to select only the columns we need for each resource and leverage JOINs and sub-SELECT statements to optimize data loading based on the resources to load which are sometimes less straightforward to implement with a full-service object-relational mapping (ORM) layer.</p>
<p>However, the main benefit of this approach is the tiny memory footprint of using a raw MySQL client compared to using an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer that’s unnecessarily complex for our needs. Since there’s no unnecessary abstraction, forgoing the use of an ORM drastically simplifies the flow of data. Once the raw rows come back from MySQL, we effectively use the simplest ORM possible: we create plain old Ruby objects from the raw rows to model the business domain. We then use these Ruby objects for the remainder of the request. Below is an example of how it’s done.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Of course, not using an ORM layer comes with a cost: if implemented poorly, this approach can lead to more complexity leaking into the application code. Creating thin model abstractions using plain old Ruby objects prevents this from happening, and makes it easier to interact with resources while meeting our performance criteria. Of course, this approach isn’t particularly common and has the potential to cause panic in software engineers who aren’t heavily involved in performance work, instead worrying about schema migrations and compatibility issues. However, when speed is critical, we accept to take on that complexity.</p>

<p>An HTTP request for a Shopify storefront may end up requiring many different resources from data stores to render properly. For example, a request for a product page could lead to requiring information about other products, images, variants, inventory information, and a whole lot of other data not loaded on multi-statement select. The first time the storefront rendering engine loads this page, it needs to query the database, sometimes making multiple requests, to retrieve all the information it needs. This usually happens during the request at any given time.</p>
<figure><img alt="A flow diagram showing the Storefront Renderer's requests from  the data stores and how it uses a Query Book Keeper Middlewear to eager-load data" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-request-bookeeping-solution_adbd68eb-cc30-4be5-9bdf-104011224ad2.jpg?v=1607636269" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/flow-request-bookeeping-solution_adbd68eb-cc30-4be5-9bdf-104011224ad2.jpg?v=1607636269">
<figcaption>Flow of a request with the Book-keeping solution</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As it retrieves this data for the first time, the storefront rendering engine keeps track of the queries it performed on the database for that particular product page and stores that list of queries in a key-value store for later use. When an HTTP request for the same product page comes in later (which it knows when the cache key matches), the rendering engine looks up the list of queries it performed throughout the previous request of the same type and performs those queries all at once, at the very beginning of the current request, because we’re pretty confident we’ll need them for this request (since they were used in the previous request).</p>
<p>This book-keeping mechanism lets us eager-load data we’re pretty confident we’ll need. Of course, when a page changes, this may lead to over-fetching and/or under-fetching, which is expected, and the shape of the data we fetch stabilizes quickly over time as more requests come in.</p>
<p>On the other side, some liquid models of Shopify’s storefronts are not accessed as frequently, and we don’t need to eager-load data related to them. If we did, we’d increase I/O wait time for something that we probably wouldn’t use very often. What the new rendering engine does instead is lazy-load this data by default. Unless the book-keeping mechanism described above eager-loads it, we’ll defer retrieving data to only load it if it’s needed for a particular request.</p>

<p>Much like a CPU’s caching architecture, the new rendering engine implements multiple layers of caching to accelerate responses.</p>
<p>A critical aside before we jump into this section: adding caching should never be the first step towards building performance-oriented software. Start by building a solution that’s extremely fast from the get go, even without caching. Once this is achieved, then consider adding caching to reduce load on the various components on the system while accelerating frequent use cases. Caching is like a sharp knife and can introduce hard to detect bugs.</p>
<h2>In-Memory Cache</h2>
<figure><img alt="A data scheme diagram showing that the Storefront Renderer and Redis instance are contained in a Kubernetes node. Within the Storefront Renderer is an In-memory cache. The Storefront Renderer sends Redis data. The Storefront Renderer sends data to two sharded data stores outside of the Kubernetes node: Sharded MySQL and Sharded Redis" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-renderer-data-schema-in-memory-cache.jpg?v=1607636398" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Storefront-renderer-data-schema-in-memory-cache.jpg?v=1607636398">
<figcaption>A simplified data schema of the application with an in-memory cache for the Storefront Renderer</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At the frontline of our caching system is an in-memory cache that you can essentially think of as a global hash that’s shared across requests within each web worker. Much like the majority of our caching mechanisms, this caching layer uses the LRU caching algorithm. As a result, we use this caching layer for data that’s accessed very often. This layer is especially useful in high throughput scenarios such as flash sales.</p>
<h2>Node-local Shared Caching</h2>
<p>As a second layer on top of the in-memory cache, the new rendering engine leverages a node-local Redis store that’s shared across all server workers on the same node. Since the database is available on the same machine as the rendering engine process itself, this node-local data transfer prevents network overhead and improves response times. As a result, multiple Ruby processes benefit from sharing cached data with one another.</p>
<h2>Full-page Caching</h2>
<p>Once the rendering engine successfully renders a full storefront response for a particular type of request, we store the final output (most often an HTML or JSON string) into the local Redis for later retrieval for subsequent requests that match the same cache key. This full-page caching solution lets us prevent regenerating storefront responses if we can by using the output we previously computed.</p>
<h2>Database Query Results Caching</h2>
<p>In a scenario where the full-page output cache, the in-memory cache, and the node-local cache doesn’t have a valid entry for a given request, we need to reach all the way to the database. Once we get a result back from MySQL, we transparently cache the results in Redis for later retrieval based on the queries and their parameters. As long as the cache keys don’t change, running the same database queries over and over always hit Redis instead of reaching all the way to the database.</p>
<h2>Liquid Object Memoizer</h2>
<p>Thanks to the Liquid templating language, merchants and partners may build custom storefront themes. When loading a particular storefront page, it’s possible that the Liquid template to render includes multiple references to the same object. This is common on the product page for example, where the template will include many references to the product object: <br><code>{{ product.title }}</code>, <code>{{ product.description }}</code>, <code>{{ product.featured_media }}</code>, and others.</p>
<p>Of course, when each of these are executed, we don’t fetch the product over and over again from the database—we fetch it once, then keep it in memory for later use throughout the request lifecycle. This means that if the same product object is required multiple times at different locations during the render process, we’ll always use the same one and only instance of it throughout the entire …</p></div></div>

<p>A <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study has found</a> that elderly patients who underwent emergency surgery on their surgeon’s birthday had significantly higher 30-day mortality rates than patients whose surgery took place on any other day of the year. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>



<p>The 30-day mortality rate (defined as death within 30 days after surgery)&nbsp;for the “surgeon’s birthday” group was 6.9%. This was 23% higher than the 5.6% rate for the “other day” group.</p>



<p>The study, which appears today in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BMJ</a>),&nbsp;looked at 980,876 procedures performed in US hospitals by 47,489 surgeons.&nbsp;Of those procedures, 2,064 (0.2%) took place on a surgeon’s birthday.&nbsp;The patients were all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 99. They had all undergone one of 17 common emergency surgical procedures between 2011 and 2014.</p>



<h2>Distractions during the most common emergency surgery types </h2>



<p>Examples of those 17 procedures included cardiovascular surgeries, hip and femur fracture, appendectomy, and small bowel resection. The study focused on&nbsp;emergency surgery, so as to&nbsp;minimize the potential selection bias. For example, surgeons might otherwise choose patients based on their illness severity, or patients might choose their surgeon.</p>



<p>As the authors write, “The effect size of surgeons’ birthday observed in our analysis (1.3 percentage point increase or a 23% increase in mortality), though substantial, is comparable to the impact of other events, including holidays (e.g., Christmas and New Year) and weekends.” <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>



<p>In fact, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3m5rimG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of surgery</a> has often demonstrated that external factors can influence surgical outcomes. The authors refer to a 2014 study showing that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23345314/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patients admitted to Scottish emergency rooms on&nbsp;public holidays had a 27% increase</a> in 30-day mortality.&nbsp;Other research has found, for example,&nbsp;that doctors are more likely to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1910546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prescribe antibiotics</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opioids</a> — and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2733171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less likely to order&nbsp;cancer screening tests</a> — as the workday progresses. This is most likely because the “cumulative cognitive demand” of such decisions gradually takes its toll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research on judges has yielded similar results. It has found, for example, that external factors as diverse as outdoor temperatures and sports results can influence judges’ decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A natural experiment: ER surgery on the doctor’s birthday</h2>



<p>But the authors say the “natural experiment” in the present study is more revealing than, for example, holiday-related mortality rates. That is because “those events not only affect physicians’ performance but also influence patients’ decision to seek care (i.e., patients seeking care on these special days might be sicker than those seeking care on other days), as well as hospital staffing.” Unless, of course, the patients know their surgeon’s birthday, which is unlikely (though that may change if this study becomes widely known).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 1.3% effect size was the result after a very through series of controls. These included, for example, excluding those surgeons with the highest patient mortality rates. Other controls included assigning a random “pseudo-birthday” to surgeons to see whether the results still held up, or checking whether the surgeon did an above-average number of procedures on their birthday. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p>



<p>Likewise, the researchers controlled for “milestone” birthdays (such as 40 or 50). They also controlled for whether a birthday fell on a Friday, which might make after-work birthday festivities more likely.&nbsp;Their findings also held up when the analysis was restricted to procedures with the highest average mortality, or to only the most ill patients.&nbsp;In fact, without these adjustments, the 30-day mortality rate difference between the birthday and non-birthday groups (the unadjusted rate) was even higher (7.0% vs. 5.6%, or a 1.4% difference).</p>



<h2><strong>Why</strong> does emergency surgery suffer on surgeon’s birthday?</h2>



<p>The authors propose a few potential explanations for this “birthday effect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include hurrying through an emergency surgery to be on time for after-work birthday events; <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-finds-users-not-notifications-initiate-89-of-smartphone-interactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distracting</a> birthday-related phone calls or text messages; more conversations with well-wishing staff members; and a decreased likelihood to go back to the hospital that evening if a patient’s condition deteriorates.</p>



<p>They also found that some surgeons did not work on their birthdays. While 2,144 surgeons in this study performed procedures one day before their birthday, and 2,027 did so one day after their birthday, only 1,805 surgeons carried out procedures on their actual birthday. This does not affect the results of the study’s analyses. But it does suggest “that birthdays are an important enough factor for some surgeons to choose not to operate on that day, which supports the credibility of our assumption that a birthday could be a distracting factor for those surgeons who choose to operate on that day,” the authors write.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Limitations</strong> <strong>and future directions</strong></h2>



<p>The researchers emphasized that this study focused on common procedures, and on older Medicare patients. This means that the findings may not apply to other types of patients, or to other surgical procedures.</p>



<p>Still, the authors write, these results may lead to “additional support for surgeons who have potentially distracting events,” such as birthdays, “to make sure that patients receive high quality surgical care regardless of when undergo surgery.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@riahsolomon?source=post_page-----e8a923d271cd--------------------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="Riah Solomon" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/2*sDQQIlKnLTsqBaU0H-tDAQ.jpeg" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="68a4">More and more enterprises are offering customer managed keys (CMK), having seen the value in giving control to customers as data privacy regulations spark change.</p><p id="9d8b">However, not all CMK are created equal.</p><p id="6a97">We’ve found it increasingly frustrating to hear CMK and its many different names used to describe a variety of architectures, some of which don’t meet the baseline requirement of giving a customer control of their data. It’s time to set the record straight and give you the tools to research and plan for CMK at your own company.</p><p id="4a64">Don’t just take our word for it. We’re not the only ones who think CMK is one of the best data privacy options available to SaaS businesses. As you’ll see in the infographic below, Salesforce, Slack, Box, Rally Software and others have all proven that CMK is both feasible and profitable.</p><p id="89f5">Let’s start with a simple definition from our <a href="https://ironcorelabs.com/cmk/" rel="noopener">CMK overview page</a>.</p><blockquote><p id="a493">Customer Managed Keys, or CMK, is a cloud architecture that gives customers ownership of the encryption keys that protect some or all of their data stored in SaaS applications. It is per-tenant encryption where your customers can independently monitor usage of their data and revoke all access to it if desired.</p></blockquote><p id="f12c">Ownership of keys is one of the key points that differentiates CMK from other similar security architectures. If the customer doesn't have full ownership of the keys and the SaaS vendor can see or access those keys in any way, that’s not what we call CMK.</p><p id="e5e8">Many variations of CMK exist within the industry. Here’s an infographic comparing some of these approaches.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5590/1*OpLsoEjcYapSZIL_HKrDww.jpeg" width="2795" height="8579" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*OpLsoEjcYapSZIL_HKrDww.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*OpLsoEjcYapSZIL_HKrDww.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*OpLsoEjcYapSZIL_HKrDww.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*OpLsoEjcYapSZIL_HKrDww.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/20/1*OpLsoEjcYapSZIL_HKrDww.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="c8e1">To learn more about the trust models mentioned above, read our recent blog.</p><p id="44cb">We’ve talked with a lot of Security Architects, CISOs, CTOs and CEOs about CMK, and here are some of the most common questions they ask.</p><h2 id="24fb">1. What data privacy regulations do you or your customers need to comply with?</h2><p id="ba81">CMK meets the needs of most compliance regimes by giving full audit trails on data access. It can also help with tricky cases like holding EU data post-Schrems II.</p><p id="b086">Standard contractual clauses and updated privacy policies aren’t a sufficient basis to allow U.S. companies to hold the data of E.U. citizens. New privacy regulations and rulings mean that companies must use technical measures to protect data or else risk lawsuits and fines.</p><p id="4178">CMK architectures where your customers hold their own keys allows you to hand over data that’s encrypted if a Government so compels you. Many thorny regulatory requirements are eased using CMK with customer held keys.</p><h2 id="2ed2">2. How much effort is it to get started and what are the tradeoffs?</h2><p id="bb9b">The most important thing to understand is that CMK is that it’s not an all-or-nothing approach. There’s a lot of flexibility with CMK to make it what you need it to be based on the requirements of your app. Usually, this means starting with a small subset of data, shipping the feature so your customers get the benefit of data control, and then adding more slices of data later as necessary.</p><p id="6d7b">But let’s be real. Encrypting data creates barriers to working with that data and sets up some tradeoffs. But these tradeoffs typically aren’t as big of a deal as many people fear. Here are the most common concerns we hear.</p><ul><li id="e915"><strong>Performance:</strong> Will this slow down our app? Usually not. There is some performance overhead, but if you architect it well, your users won’t notice any difference.</li><li id="7399"><strong>Analytics:</strong> Can we still query on this data? It depends. If the data is in a standard SQL database, then you probably can’t query on the encrypted fields. But with CMK you can decrypt on the server, so you have the option of fetching and post-filtering or summing or whatever it is you need to do. There are also options for finding data such as using search.</li><li id="43ad"><strong>Search: </strong>Can I search on an encrypted field? Probably yes, but you may have to change how you do the search so you can keep the data secure and private. IronCore Labs offers an encrypted search feature for our CMK product. Ask us if it’s right for your use case.</li><li id="c196"><strong>Scope:</strong> What do I need to encrypt? You likely need to encrypt things like social security numbers, names, and street addresses. You probably don’t need to encrypt things like preferences and purchase histories and state and country. Start with the most sensitive data and build from there.</li></ul><h2 id="cce2">3. What will this cost me?</h2><p id="ffb9">Probably nothing. In most cases, CMK produces large returns in the form of new business, larger customers, and, if you choose to sell it for a premium, new revenue streams from existing customers.</p><p id="768f">If you add CMK, it’s critical that your product marketing, sales, and renewal teams are out touting it to your customers and prospects. It will make their jobs easier and their commission checks larger.</p><p id="eaba">There are ways of getting started that require almost zero up-front costs and little time. And for bigger changes, it’s better to get a product on the roadmap when your team realizes CMK is a feature your customers will pay a premium for. We cover this more in a <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ironcorelabs.com/insights-from-slack-and-salesforce-grow-your-saas-with-premium-data-privacy-2937773da733">blog on Salesforce’s CMK product</a>.</p><blockquote><p id="b015">How much does Salesforce charge customers for premium data control like this?<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/platform/shield/" rel="noopener"> They charge 30%</a> on top of the current contract. It’s an expensive feature, but your enterprise customers are willing to pay for premium privacy to protect their data (and their reputation/revenue).</p></blockquote><p id="05ab">For most data privacy or security features, SaaS vendors have to absorb the cost of implementation and any commercial tools as overhead. CMK is different. This is a premium privacy feature. <strong>And it pays for itself.</strong></p><p id="5210">With extensive experience in data privacy, enterprise security, and cryptography, we’ve got a team ready to get you started with CMK today. Companies can spend years creating CMK from scratch, but we built the<a href="https://ironcorelabs.com/products/saas-shield/" rel="noopener"> SaaS Shield CMK Kit and SaaS Shield CMK for Amazon S3</a> products to make life easier for you and better for your customers.</p><blockquote><p id="c0fe">IronCore Labs’ CMK solution is perfect to bring extra privacy and control to our customers. They’ve been a great partner to us.</p><p id="24aa">— Michele Kubicek, Manager, Product Management, Rally Software</p></blockquote><p id="2c44">Here’s what your security features could look like with IronCore, with us giving you the tools to create the premium layer of security.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4496/1*DlR5cMk7QcqdDL0AnKW3bQ.jpeg" width="2248" height="1063" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*DlR5cMk7QcqdDL0AnKW3bQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*DlR5cMk7QcqdDL0AnKW3bQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*DlR5cMk7QcqdDL0AnKW3bQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*DlR5cMk7QcqdDL0AnKW3bQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*DlR5cMk7QcqdDL0AnKW3bQ.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><h2 id="6913">Ready to get started?

<p>Moritz Systems have been <a href="https://www.moritz.systems/blog/lldb-debugger-improvements-for-freebsd/">contracted</a>
by the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation</a> to modernize the
<a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> debugger’s support for
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.  We are working on a new plugin
utilizing the more modern client-server layout that is already used
by Darwin, Linux, NetBSD and (unofficially) OpenBSD.  The new plugin is
going to gradually replace the legacy one.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/LLVM_Logo.svg" alt="LLVM">
</p><center><small><small>This dragon image is owned by Apple Inc.</small></small></center>

<p>The Project Schedule was divided into three milestones, each taking
approximately one month:</p>

<ul>
<li>M1 Introduce new FreeBSD Remote Process Plugin for x86_64 with
basic support and upstream to LLVM.</li>
<li>M2 Ensure and add the mandated features in the project (process
launch, process attach (pid), process attach (name), userland
core files, breakpoints, watchpoints, threads, remote debugging)
for FreeBSD/amd64 and FreeBSD/i386.</li>
<li>M3 Iterate over the LLDB tests. Detect and as time permits fix bugs.
Ensure bug reports for each non-fixed and known problem. Add missing
man pages and update the FreeBSD Handbook.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.moritz.systems/blog/freebsd-remote-plugin-is-now-the-default-in-lldb/">previous report</a>
we have announced the completion of the second project’s milestone,
that is achieving the feature parity with the legacy plugin and enabling
the new plugin by default on 32 and 64-bit x86.  We have explained how different
platforms express process and thread identifiers and how <code>SIGTRAP</code> is used
to deliver event notifications to the debugger.  We have also described
the two alternative approaches on hooking the debugger up to the process -
either via launching it, or attaching to a running process.</p>

<p>The third milestone was focused on fixing bugs, updating the test suite
state and documentation.  We are proud to announce that this stage
is finished as well, and therefore <strong>the whole contract is accomplished
timely and successfully</strong>.
In this article, we would like to shortly summarize our work
and describe some of the more interesting areas of focus in detail.</p>

<h2 id="a-race-condition-while-copying-watchpoints-to-new-threads">A race condition while copying watchpoints to new threads</h2>

<p>The primary goal in the third milestone was to go through failing tests
and either fix them, or at least document the failures and mark
the respective tests as expected to fail.  The first really interesting
problem we’ve found while investigating the
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/7e2ef84fe7232368f92ec0835c3eda869c85a445/lldb/test/API/commands/watchpoints/multiple_threads/main.cpp">commands/watchpoints/multiple_threads</a>
test.
The purpose of the test is to verify that watchpoints work when
the respective variables are altered by a non-main thread.</p>

<p>Originally, the test was done in two variants: with the watchpoint being
set before starting the new thread, and after starting it.  The first
variant was supposed to verify whether LLDB correctly copies existing
watchpoints to new threads as they are being started.  The second
variant verified whether the <code>watchpoint</code> command correctly adds
the new watchpoint to all running threads.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/debug_regs_copying.svg" alt="Debug Registers in threading application"></p>

<p>What’s important here is that hardware-assisted watchpoints on x86
are configured via altering the state of Debug Registers.  Like other
register sets, the values of DRs are thread-local, and therefore
the debugger needs to set them separately for every thread.
Furthermore, new threads inherit the DR state from parent threads
on FreeBSD, and our original watchpoint code relied on new threads
having the correct DR at start.</p>

<p>However, there is a catch.  The new thread is not reported to
the debugger until it is actually ready to start.  During this time,
the DRs are copied from the parent thread and it continues execution.
In fact, it is entirely feasible that the process is stopped due
to breakpoint in the parent thread before the new thread is actually
reported ready.  This creates an ample opportunity for the user to set
a new watchpoint, and this is precisely what happened to us during
the test.</p>

<p>At this point, the debugger is not yet aware that another thread
is being created.  However, the kernel has already copied the Debug
Register values from the parent thread.  As a result, the new thread
is created with the old DR values, while the debugger assumed that it
had the new values instead.</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=250954">reported this confusing behavior</a>
to the FreeBSD Bugzilla.  For the time being, we’ve changed the plugin
to explicitly copy DRs when a new thread is reported, therefore
guaranteeing that any changes during the problematic period are
propagated.  We have also extended the original test to cover three
scenarios: watchpoint set before requesting the new thread, watchpoint
set immediately after requesting it (i.e. falling into our race
condition) and watchpoint set after waiting for the new thread
to actually start running (i.e. covering the original intent).</p>

<h2 id="simplifying-the-register-reading-and-writing-logic">Simplifying the register reading and writing logic</h2>

<p>The original register reading and writing logic in the new plugin
has been inspired by the code present in the NetBSD plugin.  It roughly
consisted of <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/58abbf821ce88f4d35cdfa36cdb486e2d56a04e2#diff-fe8211dffcb3e79e018065063ac970a718e5905c699517348d80c61859fcd989L538">a large switch-case construct</a>
that mapped enumeration values into appropriate operations on system
structures.  There were three large switches in total: one for reading
register values, one for writing register values and one for mapping
enumeration values from i386 to amd64 platform.  Furthermore, the first
two needed large separate variants for i386 and amd64.</p>

<p>At the same time, LLDB already carried another set of register
information that was created via macros by inspecting struct field
offsets and sizes.  Unlike the plugin logic, it did not use system
structures but instead <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/58abbf821ce88f4d35cdfa36cdb486e2d56a04e2/lldb/source/Plugins/Process/Utility/RegisterContextFreeBSD_x86_64.cpp#L17">inlined them</a>.
This is because the same structures are used to access core dumps,
and avoiding system headers makes it possible to compile the code
and inspect FreeBSD core dumps on other systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/register_mode.svg" alt="LLDB Registers"></p>

<p>Unlike NetBSD, the Linux plugin actually reused the offsets and sizes
from this data to access register sets.  We have decided to follow suit,
and replace the aforementioned custom logic with accesses based
on offset and size values, and this allowed us to reduce code
duplication significantly.  We have also added platform-specific <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6adb55877c4bae6c75ab0d2c0374fab6787bff2d/lldb/unittests/Process/Utility/RegisterContextFreeBSDTest.cpp">tests
that verify that the offsets and sizes are correct, compared to system
structures</a>.</p>

<p>What’s even more important is that this change improved maintainability
a lot.  We have had hit cryptic bugs that turned out to be caused
by wrong integer type being used inside the switch-case.  Storing
the sizes inside a list makes it possible to easily verify their
correctness and avoid future bugs due to size mismatches.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-cases-of-the-legacy-plugin-being-wrongly-used">Fixing cases of the legacy plugin being wrongly used</h2>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/lldb_plugins.svg" alt="LLDB plugins"></p>

<p>The process plugins in LLDB are split into two kinds: client plugins
and server plugins.  Client plugins are used by the LLDB client, while
server plugins are used by <code>lldb-server</code> to implement the remote
protocol.  The legacy FreeBSD plugin is a client plugin - it is loaded
by LLDB and used to debug a program.  The modern FreeBSD plugin is
a server plugin - it is loaded by the LLDB server and used to implement
the GDB remote protocol.  Another plugin called <code>gdb-remote</code> provides
a glue between the client and server.  It is loaded by the client,
it spawns lldb-server and fulfills client’s requests by communicating
with the server.</p>

<p>Therefore, by switching between the legacy and remote FreeBSD plugins,
we are actually switching between using the legacy client plugin
and the <code>gdb-remote</code> plugin that spawns lldb-server with the remote
FreeBSD plugin.  Our original switching logic (based on the prior art
from the Windows plugin) consisted of two pieces: <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/2c2eb5e6702bf3bbb8fb8f09790b1ab7b139e879/lldb/source/Plugins/Platform/FreeBSD/PlatformFreeBSD.cpp#L250">a boolean switch in
PlatformFreeBSD</a>
and a code blocking the legacy plugin from being loaded when the new
plugin should be used.  However, we have established that the latter
is not really necessary, and we have removed the latter part as we
changed the preferred plugin.</p>

<p>During the final testing period, we’ve found and fixed two cases where
this was not correct: when choosing plugin for <code>process connect</code>,
and when attaching to a running process.</p>

<p>The <code>process connect</code> command is supposed to iterate through all
available process plugins, find one that initializes successfully
and use it to establish a connection to the server.  However, it lacked
any means of actually determining whether the plugin in consideration
supported remote connections at all.  This was acceptable for
non-transitional platforms that had only one candidate client plugin.
However, on FreeBSD it could randomly choose either the legacy plugin,
or the <code>gdb-remote</code> plugin.  To resolve this, we have added <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/18e4272a4fe4667a44f4d323140645a83ddfd864">explicit
filtering for remote connection support</a>,
using similar approach as for determining core file support.</p>

<p>The plugin used for launching and attaching processes was supposed
to be controlled by the aforementioned boolean switch.  If the new
plugin was to be used, the method returned true and the launch/attach
implementation from
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/1a1cc0ba7db549025ab1a504633ae4554042fd60/lldb/source/Plugins/Platform/POSIX/PlatformPOSIX.cpp#L359">PlatformPOSIX</a>
was being used.  Otherwise, it returned false and the legacy plugin
kicked in.</p>

<p>The <code>PlatformPOSIX::DebugProcess()</code> method used to launch programs
explicitly forced the <code>gdb-remote</code> plugin.  However,
the <code>PlatformPOSIX::Attach()</code> method did not specify the plugin name
and could therefore use either.  To fix this, we’ve updated it to force
<code>gdb-remote</code> consistently within the class.</p>

<h2 id="the-interaction-between-dynamic-loader-and-the-debugger">The interaction between dynamic loader and the debugger</h2>

<p>The dynamic loader is the system component responsible for loading
shared libraries that are used by the program.  This includes both
loading the linked libraries as specified by <code>DT_NEEDED</code> ELF header,
and loading additional modules at runtime via <code>dlopen(3)</code>.</p>

<p>The dynamic linker provides a <code>r_debug</code> structure that can be used
by the debugger to inspect its state, as well as monitor events - that
is, loading and unloading shared libraries.  The <code>r_debug</code> structure
is consistent across most of the Unix systems (with Solaris being
an exception).  On FreeBSD, it is declared in <code>&lt;sys/link_elf.h&gt;</code> as:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>struct</span> r_debug {
        <span>int</span>             r_version;      <span>/* Currently '1' */</span>
        <span>struct</span> link_map <span>*</span>r_map;         <span>/* list of loaded images */</span>
        <span>void</span>            (<span>*</span>r_brk)(<span>struct</span> r_debug <span>*</span>, <span>struct</span> link_map <span>*</span>);
                                        <span>/* pointer to break point */</span>
        <span>enum</span> {
                RT_CONSISTENT,          <span>/* things are …</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>Toward the bottom are the mistakes we make as programmers most frequently. They are also typically the fastest to catch
and correct.</p>
<p>Syntax errors happen as soon as you save the file and try to build. It’s even the very first thing a compiler
will do: parse your files. If it can’t parse it, you’ll get a syntax error.</p>
<p>Second, we type function/variable names wrong or we forget the shape of data in a variable and use it wrong. If you’ve
got a good test pyramid, your tests will run fast and often and hopefully catch these problems quickly. But it requires
that your tests are thorough and optimized. Let’s face it, this is hard and most test suites aren’t. That’s why a
lot of teams
are turning to type safety, because you can collapse the second level into the first so that both syntax and
reference/type errors are caught immediately when you try to compile/build.</p>
<p>Type safety also allows powerful tooling that can tighten feedback loops further by offering relevant suggestions, information
on hover &amp; descriptive inline errors.</p>
<p>And, once again, with languages with value type errors and exhaustive results handling (i.e. Elm, Rust, etc.), you can
even make the third layer of this pyramid provide immediate feedback at build time, further tightening your feedback
loop.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><strong>Today, we are going to show you how to set up a literate programming environment, allowing you to use an IDE (VS Code) and an interactive computing environment (Jupyter), without leaving your browser, for free, in under 5 minutes. You’ll even see how VSCode and Jupyter work together automatically!</strong>  But first, what is literate programming?  And how did I go from skeptic to a zealot of literate programming?</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.  According to Knuth, literate programming provides higher-quality programs by forcing programmers to explicitly state the thoughts behind the program.  This process makes poorly thought-out design decisions more obvious. Knuth also claims that literate programming provides a first-rate documentation system, which is not an add-on, but is grown naturally in the process of exposition of one’s thoughts during a program’s creation. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first learned about literate programming, I was quite skeptical.  For the longest time, I had wrongly equated <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a> with literate programming.  Indeed, Jupyter is a brilliant interactive computing system, which was awarded the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-receives-the-acm-software-system-award-d433b0dfe3a2">Software System Award</a>, and is loved by many developers. However, Jupyter falls short of the literate programming paradigm for the following reasons:<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>It can be difficult to compile source code from notebooks.</li>
  <li>It can be difficult to diff and use version control with notebooks because they are not stored in plain text.</li>
  <li>It is not clear how to automatically generate documentation from notebooks.</li>
  <li>It is not clear how to properly run tests suites when writing code in notebooks.</li>
</ul>

<p>My skepticism quickly evaporated when I began using <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>, a project that extends notebooks to complete the literate programming ideal.  I spent a month, full time, using nbdev while contributing to the python library <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastcore">fastcore</a>, and can report that Donald Knuth was definitely onto something.  The process of writing prose and tests alongside code forced me to deeply understand why the code does what it does, and to think deeply about its design.  Furthermore, the reduced cognitive load and speed of iteration of having documentation, code, and tests in one location boosted my productivity to levels I have never before experienced as a software developer.  Furthermore, I found that developing this way bolstered collaboration such that code reviews not only happened faster but were more meaningful.  In short, nbdev may be the most profound productivity tool I have ever used.</p>

<p>As a teaser, look how easy it is to instantiate this literate programming environment, which includes a notebook, a docs site and an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed! <img title=":point_down:" alt=":point_down:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f447.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

</video>



<h2 id="features-of-nbdev">Features of nbdev</h2>

<p>As discussed in the <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">docs</a>, nbdev provides the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Searchable, hyperlinked documentation, which can be automatically hosted on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a> for free.</li>
  <li>Python modules, following best practices such as <a href="http://xion.io/post/code/python-all-wild-imports.html">automatically defining <code>__all__</code></a> with your exported functions, classes, and variables.</li>
  <li>Pip and Conda installers.</li>
  <li>Tests defined directly in notebooks which run in parallel.  This testing system has been thoroughly tested with <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</li>
  <li>Navigate and edit your code in a standard text editor or IDE, and export any changes automatically back into your notebooks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you are in a notebook, you can also add charts, text, links, images, videos, etc, that are included automatically in the documentation of your library, along with standardized documentation generated automatically from your code.  <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/">This site</a> is an example of docs generated automatically by nbdev.</p>

<h2 id="github-codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">Conda</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fastai/nbdev_template">nbdev_template</a>, setting up a development environment with nbdev is far easier than it used to be. However, we realized it could be even easier, thanks to a new GitHub product called <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">Codespaces</a>.  Codespaces is a fully functional development environment in your browser, accessible directly from GitHub, that provides the following features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A full VS Code IDE.</li>
  <li>An environment that has files from the repository mounted into the environment, along with your GitHub credentials.</li>
  <li>A development environment with dependencies pre-installed, backed by <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.</li>
  <li>The ability to serve additional applications on arbitrary ports.  For nbdev, we serve a Jupyter notebook server as well as a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> based documentation site.</li>
  <li>A shared file system, which facilitates editing code in one browser tab and rendering the results in another.</li>
  <li>… <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces">and more</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Codespaces enables developers to immediately participate in a project without wasting time on DevOps or complicated setup steps.  Most importantly, CodeSpaces with nbdev allows developers to quickly get started with creating their own software with literate programming.</p>

<h2 id="a-demo-of-nbdev--codespaces">A demo of nbdev + Codespaces</h2>

<p>This demo uses the project <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastcore">fastai/fastcore</a>, which was built with nbdev, as an example.   First, we can navigate to this repo and launch a Codespace:</p>

<video alt="Codespaces demo" playsinline="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="">
    <source type="video/mp4" src="https://github.com/machine-learning-apps/demo-videos/raw/master/codespaces-nbdev/1_open.mp4">
</video>



<p>If you are launching a fresh Codespace, it may take several minutes to set up. Once the environment is ready, we can verify that all dependencies we want are installed (in this case <code>fastcore</code> and <code>nbdev</code>):</p>

<video alt="Codespaces demo" playsinline="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="">
    <source type="video/mp4" src="https://github.com/machine-learning-apps/demo-videos/raw/master/codespaces-nbdev/2_verify.mp4">
</video>



<p>Additionally, we can serve an arbitrary number of applications on user-specified ports, which we can open through VSCode as shown below:</p>

<video alt="Codespaces demo" playsinline="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="">
    <source type="video/mp4" src="https://github.com/machine-learning-apps/demo-videos/raw/master/codespaces-nbdev/3_nb_small.mp4">
</video>



<p>In this case, these applications are a notebook and docs site.  Changes to a notebook are reflected immediately in the data docs.  Furthermore, we can use the cli command <code>nbdev_build_lib</code> to sync our notebooks with python modules.  This functionality is shown below:</p>

<video alt="Codespaces demo" playsinline="" muted="" loop="" autoplay="">
    <source type="video/mp4" src="https://github.com/machine-learning-apps/demo-videos/raw/master/codespaces-nbdev/4_reload_small.mp4">
</video>



<p>This is amazing!  With a click of a button, I was able to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Launch an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed.</li>
  <li>Launch two additional applications: a Jupyter Notebook server on port 8080 and a docs site on port 4000.</li>
  <li>Automatically update the docs and modules every time I make a change to a Jupyter notebook.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg.  There are additional utilities for <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/test.html">writing and executing tests</a>, <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/sync.html#Diff-notebook---library">diffing notebooks</a>, <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/magic_flags.html#How-do-comment-flags-correspond-to-magic-flags?">special flags</a> for hiding, showing, and collapsing cells in the generated docs, as well as <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/cli.html#nbdev_install_git_hooks">git hooks</a> for automation.  This and more functionality is covered in <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">the nbdev docs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="give-it-a-try-for-yourself">Give It A Try For Yourself</h2>

<p>To try out nbdev yourself, <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial.html">take this tutorial</a>, which will walk you through everything you need to know.  The tutorial also shows you how to use a repository template with the configuration files necessary to enable Codespaces with nbdev.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-write-blogs-with-notebooks-too">You Can Write Blogs With Notebooks, Too!</h2>

<p>This blog post was written in <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a> which is also built on nbdev!  We recommend <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a> if you want an easy way to blog with Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2, a deep-learning model that predicts protein structures, achieved significant improvements over other methods in the biannual CAPS protein folding prediction competition.</li>
  <li>The improvements are so large that some claim protein folding is a solved problem. However, while almost all applaud the impressive advancement, many note the caveats and limitations of AlphaFold 2 in both the problem of protein folding and downstream uses in biology.</li>
  <li>After weighing the opinions of many experts, we take the view that while AlphaFold 2 should be celebrated, it is still just one step (though a big one!), and will not significantly advance practical applications like drug discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>

<p>On the last day of November 2020, Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP), a biennial challenge for computational biologists on the problem of “protein folding”, released its results, showing DeepMind’s AI-driven <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">Alphafold 2</a> outperforming its competitors by a large margin. 
The pace of Alphafold’s improvement came as a shock to many researchers and mainstream media publications, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55133972">who heralded the development as a game-changer for biology</a>. 
Others acknowledged the uses of the tool, but <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/">cautioned that there were many more challenges </a>in the protein-folding prediction space that may warrant a tempering of expectations, let alone the broader field of biology.</p>

<p>In the world of proteins, form determines function. 
Thus, the ability to look forward and predict protein structures would help all kinds of biology subfields, from the more basic science work to drug discovery. 
Historically, attempts to model proteins have failed due to exponentially increasing computing costs, but <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/3433701.3433707">specialized computational hardware</a> appears well-equipped to address this issue.</p>

<p>Alphafold made some waves with its 2018 CASP win, but the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/12/google-s-deepmind-aces-protein-folding">media coverage was decidedly more muted then</a>. 
The pace of Alphafold’s 2020 improvement on top of its own success in 2018 was shocking for many experts, who felt that a solution to the <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/major-scientific-advance-deepmind-ai-alphafold-solves-50-year-old-grand-challenge-of-protein-structure-prediction/">50-year old protein-solving problem </a>was finally in sight. 
One important note is that AlphaFold 2, like other methods submitted to CASP, doesn’t actually model <em>how</em> proteins fold - it just predicts the final structure of the protein after it has folded.</p>

<p>There are a number of quality blog posts that explain protein folding and AlphaFold 2. <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford">Jason Crawford</a> at Roots of Progress gives an accessible review of protein folding in <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/alphafold-protein-folding-explainer">What is the “protein folding problem”? A brief explanation.</a> It is also summarized in this excellent Twitter thread:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today Google <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepMind?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DeepMind</a> announced that their deep learning system AlphaFold has achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy on the “protein folding problem”, a grand challenge problem in computational biochemistry.</p><p>What is this problem, and why is it hard?<a href="https://t.co/OjbP3RBPEi">https://t.co/OjbP3RBPEi</a></p></div>— Jason Crawford (@jasoncrawford) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1333576221418930176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>For a more technical explanation of AlphaFold 2 itself, we refer readers to the blog posts by <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/">Mohammed AlQuraishi</a> and <a href="https://www.blopig.com/blog/2020/12/casp14-what-google-deepminds-alphafold-2-really-achieved-and-what-it-means-for-protein-folding-biology-and-bioinformatics/">Carlos Outeiral</a>. In summary, DeepMind trained a neural network model on 170k known protein structures in the publicly available <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">Protein Data Bank dataset (PDB)</a>. In addition to its many novel architecture designs, one important aspect of this neural network seems to be its use of attention mechanisms, a similar kind of architecture used by recent state-of-the-art language models like GPT-3.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An attention-based technique was used, which has shown promise across ML in language/vision/etc. This allows for efficient learning (ie capturing relations between elements) and uncovering broader principles: <a href="https://t.co/hKTcb5mTkr">https://t.co/hKTcb5mTkr</a></p>— Ali Madani (@thisismadani) <a href="https://twitter.com/thisismadani/status/1333481997210161160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

<h2 id="the-reactions">The Reactions</h2>

<h3 id="from-the-press">From the Press</h3>

<p>The press was very optimistic about AlphaFold 2’s progress in protein folding and its broader implications in biology and beyond, with headlines like:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="from-the-experts">From the Experts</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/c_outeiral/status/1334779365280903169">Carlos Outeiral</a>, Computational Biology research scientist at Oxford, also highlighted the “astoundingly” impressive results of AlphaFold 2, in the post <a href="https://www.blopig.com/blog/2020/12/casp14-what-google-deepminds-alphafold-2-really-achieved-and-what-it-means-for-protein-folding-biology-and-bioinformatics/">CASP14: what Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 really achieved, and what it means for protein folding, biology and bioinformatics</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After three decades of competitions, the assessors declared that AlphaFold 2 had succeeded in solving a challenge open for 50 years: to develop a method that can accurately, generally and competitively predict a protein structure from its sequence (or, well, a multiple sequence alignment, as we will see later). There are caveats and edge cases, as in any application — but the magnitude of the breakthrough, as well as its potential impact, are undeniable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing AlphaFold 2’s results to those of other methods: “AlphaFold 2’s accuracy is simply on a whole different level.”</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://twitter.com/MoAlQuraishi">Mohammed AlQuraishi</a>, Professor of Systems Biology at Columbia, gave praise to DeepMind’s achievements:</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">CASP14 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/s?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#s</a> just came out and they’re astounding—DeepMind looks to have solved protein structure prediction. Median GDT_TS went from 68.5 (CASP13) to 92.4!!!! Cf. their 2nd best CASP13 struct scored 92.8 (out of 100). Median RMSD is 2.1Å. I think it's over <a href="https://t.co/dQ1BOJWuwn">https://t.co/dQ1BOJWuwn</a></p>— Mohammed AlQuraishi (@MoAlQuraishi) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoAlQuraishi/status/1333383634649313280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>In his detailed blog post last year on the first iteration of AlphaFold, <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/alphafold-casp13-what-just-happened/#s2.2">AlphaFold @ CASP13: “What just happened?”</a>, Professor AlQuraishi discussed what DeepMind’s progress meant for academia and pharmaceutical companies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is “an indictment of academic science” - “There are dozens of academic groups, with researchers likely numbering in the (low) hundreds, working on protein structure prediction. […] For DeepMind’s group of ~10 researchers, with primarily (but certainly not exclusively) ML expertise, to so thoroughly route everyone surely demonstrates the structural inefficiency of academic science.”</li>
  <li>This is also “an indictment of pharma” - “What is worse than academic groups getting scooped by DeepMind? The fact that the collective powers of Novartis, Pfizer, etc, with their hundreds of thousands (~million?) of employees, let an industrial lab that is a complete outsider to the field, with virtually no prior molecular sciences experience, come in and thoroughly beat them on a problem that is, quite frankly, of far greater importance to pharmaceuticals than it is to Alphabet.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Responding to this year’s AlphaFold 2 is his new post <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/">AlphaFold2 @ CASP14: “It feels like one’s child has left home.”</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While AlphaFold 2 still has a lot of caveats, Professor AlQuraishi defends using “solved” to describe protein folding, at least in the scientific sense. He argues the remaining deficiencies of AlphaFold 2 are not scientific problems, but rather engineering ones. While engineering problems can still be exceedingly difficult, “competent domain experts know the pieces that need to fall into place to solve them.”</li>
  <li>As for AlphaFold 2’s potential applications to advance biology as a whole: “It won’t happen overnight. None of what I’m saying here will. It will take years and maybe decades, but now that protein structure prediction has become an engineering exercise, we know that many of these ideas can be realized.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically for drug development:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I will end this section with the question that gets asked most often about protein structure prediction—will it change drug discovery? Truthfully, in the short term, the answer is most likely no. But it’s complicated. 
One important thing to note is that, of the entire drug development pipeline, the early discovery stage is just that, an early stage. Even if crystallography were to become fast and routine, it would still not fundamentally alter the dynamics of drug discovery as it is practiced today, as most of the cost is in the later stages of drug development beyond medicinal chemistry and well into biology and physiology. Reliable protein structure prediction doesn’t change that.</p>

<p>However, not everyone saw the same magnitude of advancement in AlphaFold 2.
In the post <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/">No, DeepMind has not solved protein folding</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Stephen_Curry">Stephen Curry</a>, Professor of Structural Biology at Imperial College London, cautioned against using the word “solved” to describe protein folding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But we are not yet at the point where we can say that protein folding is ‘solved’. For one thing, only two-thirds of DeepMind’s solutions were comparable to the experimentally determined structure of the protein. This is impressive but you have to bear in mind that they didn’t know which two-thirds of their predictions were correct until the comparison with experimental solutions was made. Would you buy a satnav that was only 67% accurate?
So a dose of realism is required. It is also difficult to see right now, despite DeepMind’s impressive performance, that this will immediately transform biology.</p>

<p>Despite AlphaFold 2’s average accuracy of 1.6 Å:</p>

  <p>it’s still not nearly good enough for delivering reliable insights into protein chemistry or drug design. To do that, we want to be confident of atomic positions to …</p></blockquote></div></div>

            <p><strong>Dec 9, 2020</strong></p>
            
            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy illustration. The US tax code isn’t <i>nearly</i> this bad. But the flaw described <i>does</i> exist. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WITH THE FLAW DESCRIBED BELOW PLEASE READ THIS LINK. SO FAR I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYONE WHO HAS READ THIS YET CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.jpg" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.jpg" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconuts</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>

      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2 (raw coconut+paint)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3 (painted coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4 (finished coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/sales_tax.jpg" alt="sales tax"></p>

    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>

      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$7.10</td>
      <td>$8.52</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated.jpg" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/vat.jpg" alt="vat"></p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>

      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Price after tax</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconut</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1.2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2.4</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3.40</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3.60</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4.60</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4.80</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5.80</td>
      <td>$6.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

  <li>To be sure, if you could implement a sales tax that only applied to final consumers, that would be economically equivalent to VAT. Is that how state taxes work in the US? It’s hard to make simple generalizations because (1) it’s sometimes hard to say what a “final consumer” is (2) there are different laws in each state and (3) the relevant tax is sometimes called a “gross receipts” tax. The important question is: <strong>Does the US have taxes on intermediate products</strong> that “cascade” like described in the above model?

<p>As was his custom before the drive home from work with his son, the old man walked across the narrow, tenement‐lined street in Manhattan’s Little Italy to buy some fresh fruit. The grocer, who had known him for many years, helped the old man sort out some prize oranges and, as a gift, handed him a perfectly ripened, home‐grown fig. The old man smiled, accepted the backyard offering with a slight nod and started toward his car. It was then that he spotted two gunmen.</p>
<p>He called out to his son and began to sprint toward the safety of his car with surprising speed for a man of his age, but the gunmen were too quick. As they opened fire, the old man seemed caught in a great leap, suspended momentarily in the air, his arms thrown protectively around his head. Loud shots hammered through the street, bright oranges rolled across the gray pavement and the old man crashed onto the fender of his car and collapsed. The people of Mott Street watched in silence from tenement windows, fire escapes and rooftops as the gunmen slipped away. Then, to spontaneous applause, the grim street tableau came to life, and the old man—the godfather, <a href="http://www.thestacksreader.com/brando/">Marlon Brando</a>—lifted himself slowly from the ground, smiled at the cheering crowd and bowed.</p>
<p>At 11 o’clock on April 12, just as Brando was getting shot on Mott Street, Carlo Gambino, one of New York’s real godfathers, sat around the corner in a Grand Street cafe, sipping black coffee from a glass and holding 18th‐century Sicilian court in 20th‐century New York. He had arrived moments earlier in the company of his brother, Paul, and five bodyguards. It was his custom, as well as his duty as head of a Mafia family, to hear at regular intervals the endless woes of racketeers, dishonored fathers and deportable husbands. They were ushered before him, one at a time, from a waiting area in a restaurant across the street. He was the final judge to people still willing to accept his decisions as law.</p>
<hr>
<p>Back on Mott Street, two Mafiosi assigned to observe the movie production were unaware of his arrival. For hours, they had been watching Brando getting shot. They had had innumerable cups of coffee and had adjusted their open‐throat, hand ironed shirts so often that their collars had begun to wilt. Neither of them had been impressed when they heard Brando was to play the godfather, so they watched his performance critically. They volunteered to grips, cameramen and extras that they would have preferred Ernest Borgnine or Anthony Quinn.</p>
<p>“A man of that stature,” one of them said, pointing to Brando, “would never wear a hat like that. They never pinched them in the front like that. Italian block, that’s the way they wore them, Italian block.”</p>
<p>They did not like Brando’s wearing his belt below his trouser loops, either.</p>
<p>“He makes the old man look like an iceman. That’s not right. A man like that had style. He should have a diamond belt buckle. They all had diamond belt buckles. And a diamond ring and tie clasp. Those old bosses loved diamonds. They all wore them. Brando makes the guy look like an iceman.”</p>
<p>In truth, Brando did not look like the traditional double‐breasted, wide lapeled, blue‐serge racketeer. He had accepted the advice of an Italian American friend, rather than the Mafiosi themselves, and made himself look old and bent. He wore a sack shaped suit of an undistinguished brown stripe and an outsize over coat. He wore a cardboard‐stiff white shirt with a collar at least two sizes too large and a striped tie so indifferently knotted that its back, label and all, faced front. The makeup man, who was never very far away, had fixed Brando with an elaborate mouth plate that made his jaw heavy and extended his jowls. Brando’s complexion was sallow, his eyes were made to droop on the side and with his graying temples and mustache many people on Mott Street that day did not recognize him until the filming began.</p>
<h5>There was an aura about the production that was unmistakable, just as there is an aura of real and imagined power around the honored society itself.</h5>
<p>The two Mafiosi did approve the vintage cars and were amused by the streetlamps, pushcarts and prices, circa 1940, tacked up in store windows. But they did not like the way the godfather’s assassins fired their guns.</p>
<p>“They hold pieces like flowers,” one said.</p>
<p>Shortly before noon a third man came up behind the pair and whispered:</p>
<p>“The old man’s around the corner.” The two men were stunned. “You kidding?” one asked. “Believe me, he’s around the corner.”</p>
<p>“Kee‐rist!”</p>
<p>“Shooo!”</p>
<p>Without further hesitation—and with the same pitch of excitement most neighborhood people saved for a peek at Brando—the trio left the movie set. They walked quickly toward the intersection and stopped. One of them darted his head around the corner of the building for a quick peek and shot back to his friends: “He’s there. He’s there. I see his car. I see Paul’s guy.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Mario Puzo’s best seller may have started out to be just another multimillion‐dollar movie for Paramount, but it wasn’t long before its producers realized that to the Mafiosi themselves the making of <em>The Godfather</em> was like the filming of a home movie. Before Puzo’s book, cops‐and‐robbers novels and films about organized crime left the mobsters cold. <em>The Godfather</em> was different. When it was published in 1969 word quickly spread across the country’s most regularly tapped telephone wires about this different book on the “honored society.” It was their <em>Forsyte Saga</em>. It was filled with bits of underworld gossip and its characters could be compared to live dons, singers, movie moguls and hit men. It depicted not only their lives, but the lives of their children, wives, enemies and friends. It emphasized their peculiar code of honor rather than their seedy, greedy little maneuverings. It dealt with their strong sense of family and their passionate loyalties. It romanticized and exaggerated their political power, wealth and influence in legitimate business. But most important, it humanized rather than condemned them.</p>
<p>The godfather himself, for instance, was shot because he refused to deal in the dirty business of narcotics. Sonny Corleone, his impetuous heir, was killed in an ambush because he tried to save his pregnant sister from a brutal husband. Michael Carleone, the godfather’s college educated war‐hero son, assumed his father’s Mafia mantle not out of greed, but from a sense of responsibility to his father, who, for all his illegal activities, was a far more honorable man than all the crooked cops, venal judges, corrupt politicians and perverted businessmen who peppered the plot.</p>
<p>Though certain Italian‐American politicians and organizations condemned Puzo for defaming all Italians, the author heard no such criticism from the society about which he had written. In fact, shortly after his book’s publication, Puzo found that some Mafiosi were anxious to meet him. They wanted to compare notes with the author of <em>The Godfather.</em> They, like other fans, refused to believe that the book was all fiction. In Las Vegas he found that a gambling debt he had run up was somehow marked paid. When Puzo protested he was told, “It’s a certain party’s pleasure.” On other occasions, bottles of champagne would arrive at his table unordered. Multisyllabic names were whispered in his ear by reverential headwaiters, and men with sunglasses and diamond rings waved at him across darkened restaurants.</p>
<hr>
<p>Six weeks before the Mott Street shooting of Brando, Albert Ruddy, the film’s producer, was uncertain whether he would be able to make the movie at all. Paramount had been deluged with letters describing the project as anti‐Italian and threatening demonstrations, boycotts and wildcat strikes by everyone from maintenance men to electricians. Letters had come from Congressmen in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, as well as from dozens of New York State legislators, judges, civic leaders and businessmen.</p>
<p>One of them began: “A book like <em>The Godfather</em> leaves one with the sickening feeling that a great deal of effort and labor to eliminate a false image concerning Americans of Italian descent and also an ethnic connotation to organized crime has been wasted …. There are so many careers and biographies that could be made into constructive and intellient movies, such as the life of Enrico Fermi, the great scientist; Mother Cabrini; Colonel Ceslona, a hero of the Civil War; Garibaldi, the great Italian who unified Italy; William Paca, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; Guglielmo Marconi, and many, many others.”</p>
<p>The letter was signed by “the Grand Venerable of the Grand Council of the Grand Lodge of New York State’s Sons of Italy.” It also informed Paramount that the studio could expect an economic boycott of the film, petitions of protest from all Sons of Italy lodges, regional meetings to plan protests, a complaint filed with the State Human Rights Division and demands that no governmental authorities give the production any cooperation whatever.</p>
<p>And as if this were not enough, there were rumors of union walkouts, work stoppages and boycotts. Ruddy could envision costly delays. He had already run into trouble trying to negotiate with householders in Manhasset, L.I., for a site that looked like a godfather’s compound. The entire community and its bureaucrats had ganged up to sabotage his efforts.</p>
<p>“First, they’d complain that we would bring additional cars into the area and take up parking space,” Ruddy said. “So we’d promise to bus our people to the locations. Then they’d say they didn’t want buses in the area. Some said that if we did use their homes for the mall and the wedding the newspapers couldn’t know about it. How could we guarantee that? We were ready to pay, rent, replant, repaint, replace everything in the area for them. We were ready to make all kinds of concessions, but in the end I realized that they just didn’t want us. They never flat came out and said no, but it amounted to the same thing.</p>

                  <div>
        <p>“She’s away on vacation for two weeks,” said Bobby, manager of the village of Quaqtaq.</p>
<p>He was talking about the head of the recreation department, who had all of the keys, most importantly the one for the Isummasarvik School’s storage room. We needed it to get the sports equipment to keep the kids occupied at day camp: balls, badminton racquets, nets, and hockey sticks.</p>
<p>I sighed inwardly. Ever since I’d been working in Nunavik, finding a key had been a recurring nightmare. I had already given up hope.</p>
<p>“Maybe you could ask the caretaker,” Bobby suggested.</p>
<p>Anne, my colleague, nodded and waved me on. We got back into the truck. On the other side of the windows, the June sun was beating down on the frozen bay that it could not crack. We stopped in front of a house near the footbridge spanning the river. The caretaker was out, but her husband exchanged a few words with Anne in Inuttitut, then disappeared and returned with the miraculous key. I pinched myself. It had taken all of five minutes.</p>
<p>That was back in 2015, my fifth summer in Nunavik. If it had happened a few years earlier, I would have probably told the story on my blog, joking about how even a simple task can be so immensely complicated in the North.</p>
<p>But as the old man held out the keys, it hit me: it was my fault that it was complicated. I had begun setting up day camps in the North in 2011. Everything that I had found difficult then was difficult because I was trying to make things work my way: planning activities and appointments in advance, holding daily meetings, requiring long-term commitment from the camp’s employees. There was another problem too: I didn’t know the people or the language well enough. I didn’t know who the caretaker was or where she lived. I wouldn’t have been able to speak with her husband, who spoke only in Inuttitut.</p>

      </div>

                        </p>
          </div>
        </figure>
      </div>

      
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>I’d learned a few words, of course, especially words useful for working with children: <em>come here, sit down, do you understand, hurry up, are you ready, stop, wait, again, a little, a lot, yesterday, today, tomorrow, yes, no, maybe, what’s your name, and how old are you.</em> We’d played Twister once, so I also knew the names of body parts, colours, left and right. I knew the names of all the animals. It was a start, but not enough to converse with the caretaker’s husband.</p>
<p>Many of the <em>Qallunaat</em> (whites) I met among the Inuit described Inuttitut as “impossible to learn.” It did indeed seem complicated, with all those qs, ks, and js, but I loved its rough sonority. Moreover, I could never feel at ease with this linguistic one-sidedness. Some of my friends were taking online courses with Professor Marc-Antoine Mahieu at INALCO (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales), affiliated with the Sorbonne in Paris. They all spoke about the class with the same blissful smile. In 2016 I signed up too. I had just quit my job to devote myself to writing. It meant that I would no longer be travelling to Nunavik but that I had more time—and I very much wanted to learn Inuttitut and keep a foot in the North.</p>
<p>In our first class, Marc-Antoine made a point of destroying our hopes. Inuttitut is a highly unfamiliar language, not nearly as easily learned as English or Spanish. Acquiring competence would take years of study and practice, and despite all that effort, we would very likely never be able to really converse.</p>
<p>Strangely, this bleak prospect soon seemed irrelevant. Little by little, I discovered a spectacular language, immensely creative and full of humour. A language that had to invent all sorts of slightly eccentric ways of naming the elements of modern life, but that described the land and hunting techniques with staggering precision. A language that seemed made for poetry with its constructed words and love of repetition; a language that taught me so many things about people that I’d been among for years without ever really knowing.</p>

                  <div>
        






<p>Don’t believe everything you’ve heard, however: there are not hundreds of words for snow.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
      <div>

                  <div>
        <p>Over and over, I’d said what so many others have: that the Inuit have a very liberal concept of time. I learned that it could be as structured as my own; it was just structured around other things. For example, the months are defined by animal behaviours.</p>
<p>September, October, November: <em>amiraijaut, arnalirnguutivik, natjuijarvik.</em></p>
<p>Time when antlers lose their velvet. Time when the males compete for females. Time when caribou shed their antlers.</p>
<p>Places that I had known by their French or English names regained their original appellations: I now dared to utter the word <em>Kangiqsualujjuaq</em>; I no longer needed to say <em>George River</em>. I was unlearning my geography, just as so many Indigenous people have had to unlearn theirs. Even the idea of “the Arctic” once hadn’t existed for the Inuit. They had to invent a word for it that suited a Western geographical perspective: <em>Ukiurtatuq</em>, which translates as “repeated winter.”</p>
<p>I found that the language had a harmonious relationship with the environment—despite the occasionally ruthless climate. In the very first Inuttitut dictionary, written by Taamusi Qumaq in 1991, Nunavik is defined as “a large country occupied by animals.” I admired this humility, this awareness that a place is shared with other species, that one is living, in a way, on <em>their</em>&nbsp; land.</p>

      </div>
      

            
    
      

            
      <div>
        <figure>
                      <img src="https://content.beside.media/beside_/app/www/2020/10/AWH_2318.jpg" alt="">
                            </figure>
       </div>

              
    
      

                  <div>
        <p>It’s perhaps precisely because of this humility that one should never speak ill of <em>sila</em>, the weather. This was a blessing for a snow lover like me, tired of the eternal whinging about winter.</p>
<p>All of these words for different kinds of snow and ice, for Northern hunting and fishing techniques, show the extent to which the Inuit were at one with their land. Some people have bandied about the idea that the ancestors of the <em>Nunavimmiut</em>&nbsp; found themselves stuck in the North, blocked from going south by the Cree in the west and Innus in the east, but this is false. Research has concluded that the ancient peoples of the Arctic in fact moved even further north during a period of warming around the year 1000, because they did not know how to survive without the cold. Today, climate change has had particularly devastating consequences for the populations of Nunavik and Nunavut.</p>
<p>In the land that would become Canada, European explorers (<em>tariup akiani</em>, “from across the sea”) saw a vast reservoir of natural resources for exploitation. Our current climate crisis is the direct result of this unbridled exploitation, our stubborn insistence on doing things our way, our belief that we can draw a hermetic border between us and <em>nuna</em>, the great land, when in fact we live in each other.</p>
<p>Our language navigates modern urbanity with much more ease than Inuttitut, but it reflects a far more distant relationship with the environment, often stuck in the idea of fighting against the elements. Could the rich vocabulary of the Inuit inspire us to redefine our relationship with nature? <span>■</span></p>

<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;<strong>tragedy of the commons</strong>&nbsp;is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their&nbsp;own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling the shared resource through their&nbsp;collective action.&nbsp;</p><cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Remind you of anything? Toilet paper in 2020, perhaps?</p>



<p>I’m struck by how often this pops up in software development:</p>



<ul><li>Hitting refresh over and over when your test environment won’t load because everyone is overloading the dev server by hitting refresh.</li><li>Teams don’t volunteer to upgrade dependencies because they all have their own milestones to meet, and eventually an upgrade would be a nightmare because they waited too long. </li><li>Disk space, disk space, disk space. “A few extra MB won’t hurt” repeated thousands of times until the drive is chock full.</li><li>One vaguely named variable ain’t no thing, but 5 years of vaguely named variables equals <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/08/2-things-ive-learned-from-reading-refactoring-by-martin-fowler/">one unmaintainable codebase</a>. </li></ul>



<p>The classic <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/">broken window theory</a> is a part of this. Once someone sets the precedent, it’s hard to walk it back. Another part is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">choosing short term over long term</a>, the enemy of growth.</p>



<p>Those two plus a healthy dose of regular old human greed adds up to <em>the tragedy of the commons</em>. </p>



<p>I have no useful insight here other than to say that it exists, and sometimes naming a thing is enough to prevent it.</p>

			<p><span><span></span> <span>9</span> <span>min read</span></span></p><div><p>Let’s be real, adding request validation to your Express based API isn’t particularly exciting, but you know that it is an important foundational part of building an API, so you sit down to figure out what you’re going to do.</p>
<p>You try and pick a validation library, but it’s more difficult than you expect because they’re all quite different from each other, and it’s not clear what benefits one has over another. Perhaps you start to build your own custom validation, but it quickly starts to feel very messy. You just want to be able to put something reliable in place for validation and move on to building the interesting stuff in your API. You wonder to yourself, is adding request validation to an Express API really this difficult?!</p>
<p>In this article I’ll introduce you to <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, which allows you to describe the format that you expect data to be in and then validate data against it. I’ll then show you how to use JSON Schema to validate requests to your Express based API and send validation errors back in the response. By the time we’re done you won’t have to waste time figuring out how to handle request validation ever again.</p>

<h2 id="getting-to-grips-with-json-schema">Getting to grips with JSON Schema</h2>



<div><p>JSON Schema is very powerful, but for now we’ll only use a few of its features so that we can get comfortable with how it works.</p>
<p>Here’s an example JSON schema showing some of the types and keywords which you can use to describe how an object should be structured:</p>
</div>



<pre><code>{
	"type": "object",
	"required": ["name"],
	"properties": {
		"name": {
			"type": "string",
			"minLength": 1
		},
		"age": {
			"type": "integer",
			"minimum": 18
		}
	}
}</code></pre>



<div><p>The nice thing about JSON Schema is that it tends to be self-documenting, which is great for us humans who want to quickly understand what’s going on. At the same time, JSON schemas are also machine readable, meaning that we can use a JSON Schema validator library to validate the data which our application receives against a schema.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I recommend you finish reading this article before diving deeper into all of the features of JSON Schema, but if you’re keen to learn more about them right now you can jump to the <a href="#handy-json-schema-links">handy links I’ve collected at the end</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>



<h2 id="why-should-i-use-json-schema-and-not-validation-library-x">Why should I use JSON Schema and not validation library X?</h2>



<div><p>Here are the things which I think make JSON Schema a uniquely ideal tool for data validation in your Node.js application.</p>
<h3>No library, framework or language lock-in</h3>
<p>There are <a href="https://json-schema.org/implementations.html">JSON Schema validation libraries</a> available for every popular programming language.</p>
<p>JSON Schema doesn’t tie you to a library or a framework e.g. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi">Joi</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup">Yup</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/validate.js">validate.js</a>. These Node.js libraries all take their own approach to defining validation rules and error messages, so the things you need to learn to use them will become obsolete if they stop being developed or become deprecated.</p>
<p>This almost happened with the Joi validation library earlier this year, when the lead maintainer of the  Hapi.js framework which it was a part of announced plans to deprecate all modules. Fortunately Joi itself seems to have been adopted by <a href="https://twitter.com/sidewaytech/status/1284237116705136640">some kind souls</a>, but it should make you think twice about committing to a specific library when more widely supported tooling is available.</p>
<h3>Move between Node.js frameworks, or even languages, and take your schemas with you</h3>
<p>Because JSON schemas aren’t tied to a framework, it’s one less thing to worry about if you decide to migrate away from Express to something else e.g. Fastify, which has built in support for <a href="https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Validation-and-Serialization/">request validation and response serialization</a> with JSON Schema.</p>
<p>Because JSON Schema itself is language agnostic and widely supported, if you ever decide to rewrite your Node.js applications in a completely different language e.g. Go or Rust, you won’t need to rewrite all of the validation – you can take your JSON schemas with you!</p>
<h3>Active and supportive community</h3>
<p>There is an active community of folks on Slack who are very willing to help you out. The official <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema website</a> has a link which you can use to join.</p>
<h3>JSON Schema is on a path to becoming a standard</h3>
<p>JSON Schema is <a href="https://json-schema.org/#project-status">on its way</a> to becoming a standard. It’s currently <a href="https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html">defined in a collection of IETF Internet-Draft documents</a>, with the intention that they will be adopted by an IETF Working Group and shepherded through to RFC status, making them eligible to become an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Standard">Internet Standard</a>.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="how-to-integrate-validation-with-json-schemas-into-your-application">How to integrate validation with JSON schemas into your application</h2>



<div><h3>First things first, parse that JSON request body</h3>
<p>Your application will need to be able to handle POST requests with a JSON body, where the <code>Content-Type</code> header is <code>application/json</code>. Here’s an example of how you can make a request like this on the command line with <a href="https://curl.se/">cURL</a>:</p>
</div>



<pre><code>curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:3000/user \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"first_name": "Test",
	"last_name": "Person",
	"age": true
}'</code></pre>



<p>In order for the routes in our Express application to be able to handle POST requests with a JSON body, we need to configure our application to use the built-in <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.json">express.json()</a> middleware:</p>



<pre><code>/**
 * You can add the `json()` middleware anywhere after you've
 * created your Express application, but you must do it before
 * you define routes which expect a JSON request body.
 *
 * If a request with a `Content-Type: application/json` header is
 * made to a route, this middleware will treat the request body as
 * a JSON string. It will attempt to parse it with `JSON.parse()`
 * and set the resulting object (or array) on a `body` property of
 * the request object, which you can access in your route handlers,
 * or other general middleware.
 */
app.use(express.json());</code></pre>



<p>This functionality has been available in Express since v4.16.0. If you’re using an older version of Express you will need to install and configure the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/body-parser.html">body-parser middleware package</a>.</p>



<div><h3>Integrate Ajv (Another JSON Schema Validator) into your application</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://ajv.js.org/">Ajv (Another JSON Schema Validator)</a> library is the most popular JSON Schema validator written for JavaScript (Node.js and browser). You can use Ajv directly, however for an Express based API it’s nice to be able to use middleware to validate request data which has been sent to an endpoint before that endpoint’s route handler is run. This allows you to prevent things like accidentally storing invalid data in your database. It also means that you can handle validation errors and send a useful error response back to the client. The <a href="https://github.com/vacekj/express-json-validator-middleware">express-json-validator-middleware</a> package can help you with all of this.</p>
<p>The <code>express-json-validator-middleware</code> package uses Ajv and allows you to pass configuration options to it. This is great as it means you have full control to configure Ajv as if you were using it directly.</p>
<p>Before we integrate this middleware into our application, let’s get it installed:</p>
</div>



<pre><code>npm install express-json-validator-middleware</code></pre>



<p>Once you have it installed you need to require it in your application and configure it:</p>



<pre><code>const { Validator } = require("express-json-validator-middleware");

/**
 * Create a new instance of the `express-json-validator-middleware`
 * `Validator` class and pass in Ajv options if needed.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv/blob/master/docs/api.md#options
 */
const { validate } = new Validator();</code></pre>



<div><h3>Using a JSON schema to validate a response</h3>
<p>In this next code snippet we’re going to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a JSON schema which describes the data which we expect to receive when a client calls our API endpoint to create a new user. We want the data to be an object which always has a <code>first_name</code> and a <code>last_name</code> property. This object can optionally include an <code>age</code> property, and if it does, the value of that property must be an integer which is greater than or equal to 18.</li>
<li>We’re going to use the user schema which we’ve defined to validate requests to our <code>POST /user</code> API endpoint.</li>
</ol>
</div>



<pre><code>const userSchema = {
	type: "object",
	required: ["first_name", "last_name"],
	properties: {
		first_name: {
			type: "string",
			minLength: 1,
		},
		last_name: {
			type: "string",
			minLength: 1,
		},
		age: {
			type: "integer",
			minimum: 18,
		},
	},
};

/**
 * Here we're using the `validate()` method from our `Validator`
 * instance. We pass it an object telling it which request properties
 * we want to validate, and what JSON schema we want to validate the
 * value of each property against. In this example we are going to
 * validate the `body` property of any requests to the POST /user
 * endpoint against our `userSchema` JSON schema.
 *
 * The `validate()` method compiles the JSON schema with Ajv, and
 * then returns a middleware function which will be run every time a
 * request is made to this endpoint. This middleware function will
 * take care of running the validation which we've configured.
 *
 * If the request `body` validates against our `userSchema`, the
 * middleware function will call the `next()` Express function which
 * was passed to it and our route handler function will be run. If Ajv
 * returns a validation error, the middleware  will call the `next()`
 * Express function with an error object which has a `validationErrors`
 * property containing an array of validation errors, and our route handler
 * function will NOT be run. We'll look at where that error object gets
 * passed to and how we can handle it in the next step.
 */
app.post(
	"/user",
	validate({ body: userSchema }),
	function createUserRouteHandler(request, response, next) {
		/**
		 * Normally you'd save the data you've received to a database,
		 * but for this example …</code></pre></div></div></div>

Introduction</h2><p>Wait… what? FreeBSD does not have Docker! Doesn’t it?</p><p>Well of course not really, but you can still install Docker using FreeBSD, it won’t just be FreeBSD in Docker since FreeBSD is not supported as Docker images.</p><p>In this blog post, I won’t discuss exactly how to install a few things, I will mostly point to blog posts and documentations so that you know what to do to install Docker and Kubernetes <strong>using</strong> FreeBSD.</p><p>I will not be using Minikube or Kind, not that I don’t like it, but my opinion is that Minikube is nice for quick and dirty small tests and it’s using VirtualBox which is like a big problem to me, but also Bhyve + VirtualBox … choice?!. And Kind is also mostly for tests, it’s closer to an installation with kubeadm, but I really prefer to try things as close to production as possible.</p><p>All these have been tested on a PC installed with FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE. It has a 6 cores cpu, and 32GB of memory.</p><p>Here is a quick summary:</p><ul><li><a href="#1-introduction">1. Introduction</a></li><li><a href="#2-details">2.

Details</h2><h3 id="21-install-sysutilsvm-bhyve-packages">2.1 Install <code>sysutils/vm-bhyve</code> packages</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve"><code>sysutils/vm-bhyve</code></a> is a shell based, minimal dependency bhyve manager. And <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/virtualization-host-bhyve.html">Bhyve</a> is a BSD licenced hypervisor. It’s being heavily developped with FreeBSD, and honestly it’s really well integrated to FreeBSD.</p><p>To install <code>vm-bhyve</code> on FreeBSD, you have to be root ofc for good reasons:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># 'sysrc -f /boot/loader.conf vmm_load="YES"'</span>
<span># Load the 'vmm' kernel module</span>
kldload vmm
<span># 'sysrc -f /boot/loader.conf nmdm_load="YES"'</span>
<span># Load the 'nmdm' kernel module</span>
kldload nmdm
<span># vm on bridge is using tap interface</span>
sysctl net.link.tap.up_on_open<span>=</span><span>1</span>
<span># edit '/etc/sysctl.conf', add 'net.link.tap.up_on_open=1'</span>
pkg install sysutils/vm-bhyve
</code></pre></div><p>I’m inviting you to go to the <code>vm-bhyve</code> GitHub page and to review its README, it has a lot of interesting informations. Just do not forget to create a switch (vm-bhyve term) and also to add your network interface to that switch.</p><p>The next thing is mostly the handling of this package. But one thing about this project is that it’s using bridge. I personaly like to have my bridge free of use, and to use firewall when it’s needed, and to be able to address my VM to my needs, which are generaly to have internet access to ease installations. Which is leading to my next point.</p><h3 id="22-configure-freebsd-sysctls-to-easily-bridge-out">2.2 Configure FreeBSD sysctls to easily bridge out</h3><p>I’m usually using PF for firewall, and to be able to have my best use of the bridge you can create with <code>vm-bhyve</code>. To this goal, I’m deciding not to firewall the bridge in any way, and to tell PF not to care about bridge it’s quite easy, it’s even a configuration I’m using for VNET jails.</p><p>So let’s change the PF behavior with bridge with these sysctls, descriptions:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge: Packet filter on the bridge interface
net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip: Only pass IP packets when pfil is enabled
net.link.bridge.pfil_member: Packet filter on the member interface

sysctl net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip<span>=</span><span>0</span>
sysctl net.link.bridge.pfil_member<span>=</span><span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can put these sysctls directly in your <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> so that at reboot it’s already configured.</p><p>Now you can only care for what’s important, and if you want to firewall your VM, you can always add one inside the VM itself.</p><h3 id="23-install-docker">2.3 Install Docker</h3><p>Just follow this blog: <a href="https://www.gamsjager.nl/2019/01/11/How-to-run-Docker-on-FreeBSD-12/">How to run Docker on FreeBSD 12</a></p><p>In this blog, the author is telling to get Debian 9 ISO, but you can also get Debian 10, it’s working as well.
Once the debian is installed, just don’t forget to follow these two links, I’ve followed them and it’s working:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/">Install Docker Engine on Debian</a></li><li><a href="https://success.docker.com/article/how-do-i-enable-the-remote-api-for-dockerd">How do I enable the remote API for dockerd</a></li></ul><p>When you are finished with this section, you should be able to use docker inside the VM, and outside, so on your host.</p><h3 id="24-install-kubernetes">2.4 Install Kubernetes</h3><p>Honestly, it should be as simple as search in your favorite Search Engine <code>Install Kubernetes</code>, but the first link you get is this one: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/">Getting started</a>.
So… yes you could follow this link but, this is not the goal!</p><p>Instead we want the <strong>R</strong>eal thing, to get closer to a production environment, even if that’s for testing. So you can get there: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/">Installing kubeadm</a>. You can follow everything on this page, it’s not hard at all. But the page only tells you to install <code>kubeadm</code>, <code>kubelet</code> and <code>kubectl</code>.</p><p>The hardest part comes with: <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">Creating a single control-plane cluster with kubeadm</a>. And here are my tips:</p><ul><li>When you install docker inside your vm, you installed it with <code>containerd.io</code>. This Kubernetes page tells you about what’s possible, either <code>Containerd.io</code>, or <code>CRI-o</code>, just do not install CRI-o, it’s not needed.</li><li>Do not forget to enable Docker in <code>systemd</code> so it’s launched when you’re VM is started</li><li>Do not forget to disable swap<ul><li><code>swapoff -a</code></li><li>edit your <code>/etc/fstab</code> to comment out the swap line</li></ul></li><li>You have to configure Docker to use the systemd cgroup and restart it, here’s my <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code>:</li></ul><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

My feelings are that Docker is easy to install, it’s really well integrated with Linux, even if I prefer FreeBSD. Also, Kubernetes is really nice, I’m just peeling the onion slowly.</p><p>At this point, I’ve already tried 2 (3 in fact…) other products installations with Kubernetes:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard">Kubernetes Dashboard</a>: This one is nice to have a Web UI to watch what’s in your Kubernetes cluser</li><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-kubernetes-monitoring-stack-with-prometheus-grafana-and-alertmanager-on-digitalocean">How To Set Up a Kubernetes Monitoring Stack with Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager on DigitalOcean</a>: And this one, although it’s about DigitalOcean Kubernetes… I’ve managed to install in my Kubernetes cluster, that was a lot of searching and testing because they are using DigitalOcean Kubernetes capabilities such as creating DO Block Storage. To that end, I had to install a <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner">Static provisioner of local volumes</a> (the 3rd product 😋), and a Kubernetes Storage Class that would mimics at least the <code>do-block-storage</code> storage class in a very “simple” way.</li></ul><p>Clearly, that was a lot of time invested, but I’m quite happy since I’ve discovered and learnt quite some informations. I’m really well aware that it’s a lot of informations to handle, but if you’ve got some time to kill, it’s really worth the trip.</p><p>Eye Candy:

I've been trying to wrap my head around the tremendous growth of the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">cloud-native zoo</a> for quite some time. But recently I was listening to <a href="https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/129-linkerd/">a wonderful podcast episode</a> with the Linkerd creator <a href="https://twitter.com/grampelberg">Thomas Rampelberg</a> and he kindly reminded me one thing about... <strong>microservices</strong>. Long story short, despite the common belief that microservices solve technical problems, the most appealing part of the microservice architecture apparently has something to do with <strong>solving organisational problems</strong> such as allocating teams to development areas or tackling software modernisation campaigns. And on the contrary, while helping with the org problems, <strong>microservices rather create new technical challenges</strong>!</p>
<p><i>Disclaimer: This article is not about Microservices vs Monolith.</i></p>
<p>That made me rethink the need for all those projects constituting the cloud-native landscape. From now on I can't help but see an awful load of projects solving all kinds of technical problems originated by the transition to the microservice paradigm.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/making-sense-out-of-cloud-native-buzz/kdpv.png" width="90%"></p></div>


<p>Starting from the foundational project, "The Production-Grade Container Orchestration" system we all know and love - <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/selected=kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>. While it's not limited by that, the idea of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">grouping <del>containers</del> Pods into Services</a> is foundational for Kubernetes. But there is even more, Kubernetes provides other higher-level capabilities vital for microservice architectures such as <a href="https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/service-discovery-in-kubernetes/#entering-kubernetes-realm">service discovery</a> or autoscaling out of the box. But if you cannot benefit from Kubernetes goodies because of... reasons, fear not! CNCF has a decent list of <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=coordination-service-discovery&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">Coordination &amp; Service Discovery</a> offerings (ZooKeeper, etcd, Netflix Eureka, etc) that can teach an old-fashioned infrastructure some new tricks.</p>
<p>Going further, the increase in the number of services naturally leads to the surge of network communications. Hence, we need to have a reliable remote procedure call layer. Luckily, the CNCF landscape has an <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=remote-procedure-call&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">RPC section</a> for you with such prominent projects as gRPC or Apache Thrift.</p>
<p>In microservice-verse, you learn pretty quickly that an uncontrolled service-to-service communication leads to a mess... that can be eliminated with a <a href="https://servicemesh.io/">mesh</a>. Projects like Linkerd, Maesh, or Istio are great representatives of the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=service-mesh&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">Service Mesh category</a>. And of course, under the hood of almost every service mesh, there is <del>a piece of black networking magic</del> proxy like Envoy, Traefik, or linkerd2-proxy. Well, apparently there is also a <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=service-proxy&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">Service Proxy category</a> gathering such proxies.</p>
<p>Having transparent service-to-service communication doesn't make every network request legitimate. In the microservice architecture, you cannot trust every service. Only requests from well-identified clients should be allowed. And CNCF landscape has something for you again - <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=key-management&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category&amp;selected=spiffe">spiffe</a> and <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=key-management&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category&amp;selected=spire">spire</a> projects to provide the distributed identity.</p>
<p>Lots of services mean lots of APIs. These APIs need to be consolidated before being exposed to the outside world. Guess what? There is a whole <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=api-gateway&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">API Gateway category</a> at your disposal.</p>
<p>Chasing bugs in microservice architectures is much trickier than in monoliths. A request may hit tens of services on its way to be served. Tracing request paths, collecting and aggregating logs from all the services are great engineering problems deserving their own categories - <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=tracing&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">Tracing</a> and <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=logging&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">Logging</a>. And of course, there is the third pillar of observability - <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=monitoring&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">Metrics and Monitoring</a>.</p>
<p><em>Containers vs microservices</em> always sounded to me like a chicken and egg problem. Anyway, it's clear now that microservices and containers work well together. Thus, we can consider the sheer amount of container-related projects like <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=container-runtime&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">runtimes</a> or <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/category=container-registry&amp;format=card-mode&amp;grouping=category">container registries</a> as microservice-supporting as well.</p>
<p>I could continue giving more and more examples here, but I hope that by this time I already managed to make my point. Sometimes, the correlation is more obvious, and sometimes there is some level of indirection but to me, it looks like the vast majority of the projects under the CNCF umbrella exist to solve the technical problems that arose only because we started using lots of smaller services in our web applications.</p>
<p>For curious, I recommend the following series of articles diving into the CNCF landscape, this time without any poor speculations 🙈:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are excited to announce that if you <strong>deploy our AWS Trivia Alexa Skill from Stackery</strong>  we will send you $100 AWS credits and an Amazon Echo!</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<ol>
<li>Build an Alexa Skill (tutorial below)using Stackery to deploy into your AWS account.</li>
<li>You can deploy the code as-is out of Stackery, or modify the content of the quiz.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/stackeryio">Tweet us</a> a screenshot of your deployed backend. It'll look something like this:</li>

<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
<h4>What is an Alexa Skill?</h4>
<p>A Skill is a voice app that can be opened on an Alexa-enabled device, such as a smart speaker, a smart home device that's Alexa-enabled, a smartwatch.</p>
<h4>What does this Skill do?</h4>
<p>This Skill asks users questions about AWS services, such as Lambda, Cognito or EC2, in a 10-question quiz game. It also gives users facts about certain AWS services.</p>
<h4>Do I need to be an AWS expert to follow this tutorial?</h4>
<p>Nope! Stackery makes it easy for <em>anyone</em> to deploy serverless apps on AWS, and adding infrastructure is as simple as dragging and dropping! You just need an AWS account, a modern browser, and a computer connected to the Internet.</p>
<h4>Do I need a lot of programming experience to follow this tutorial?</h4>
<p>No! If you can copy-paste, you can build and deploy this app. If you want to customize the quiz, you will need to know basic JavaScript.</p>
<h4>Do I need an Alexa-enabled device to test my Skill?</h4>
<p>No. The Alexa developer console includes an in-browser Alexa simulator for testing.</p>
<h4>What does it cost?</h4>
<p>Everything should fit easily within AWS's free tier, and the AWS account and Amazon Developer account are free.</p>
<h4>Can I make Alexa speak in a sarcastic tone?</h4>
<p>Sadly, no (believe me, I tried). But there are some cool things you can do with <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference.html">SSML</a>, the markup language used to dictate how Alexa generates phrases.</p>
<h4>Resources</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-overviews/build-skills-with-the-alexa-skills-kit.html">Alexa Developer docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-quiz-game">Skill sample</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/stackery/alexa-reinvent-quiz">Git repo</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">Free Amazon Developer account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackery.io/sign-up">Free Stackery Account </a></li>
</ol>
<h3>1. Create an Alexa Skill</h3>
<ol>
<li>Log in to the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask">Alexa Developer Console</a>, and click the <strong>Create Skill</strong> button</li>
<li>Name your skill whatever you'd like</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Custom</strong> as your model</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Provision your own</strong> as the method to host your skill's backend resources</li>
<li>Scroll back up, make sure everything looks right, and click <strong>Create skill</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You'll now see your newly-created skill in a list of all skills:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/XNpSqCP6SlGhz2Nq1Yh5" alt="alexa2.png"></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Click on the skill name, and navigate to <strong>Interaction Model</strong> -&gt; <strong>JSON editor</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This is where you will paste a JSON file that describes the different forms of interactions your Skill will have with users, as well as the custom data that serves as the allowable answers to quiz questions.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Copy the entire contents of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackery/alexa-reinvent-quiz/master/src/models/en-US.json">this JSON file</a> from our <a href="https://github.com/stackery/alexa-reinvent-quiz">alexa-reinvent-quiz repo</a></li>
<li>Paste the copied contents into the Alexa JSON editor, then click <strong>Save Model</strong> at the top, followed by <strong>Build Model</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/6AXcts9JREKAOzGB68Ts" alt="alexa3.png"></p>
<p>Once you save, you will see that your Intents were auto-populated. Feel free to poke around and view the sample utterances and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html">slot types</a> that are there now. When you're done, return to the main console where all of your skills are listed, as you'll need to get your Skill ID in a few moments, so be sure to leave this browser tab open.</p>
<h3>2. Build your backend in Stackery</h3>
<p><em>For this step you'll need a <a href="https://www.stackery.io/sign-up/">free Stackery account</a>, a Git provider, and a code editor. If you're a first-time Stackery user, you'll need to link your Git provider and AWS account the first time you commit and deploy a stack. Don't worry, the process is fairly quick and simple and the app will walk you through it.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>In a new tab, log in to Stackery, and create a new stack with a new repo</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/AfJ27NQSjmRwqGjrlWL8" alt="alexa-step1.gif"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>In the Visual edit mode, add a function and give it the name <code>AlexaHandler</code> and change its code source directory to <code>src/AlexaHandler</code>. Scroll down and hit <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/aH74Msn0QDOMZ1AzVGpk" alt="alexa-step2.gif"></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Flip to the Template edit mode, and add the following YAML as part of the <code>Properties</code> of your <code>AlexaHandler</code> function:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="yaml">
                    <code slot="code">   Events:
     AlexaSkillEvent:
       Type: AlexaSkill
       SkillId: [your-skill-id]
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code></li>
<li>Replace <code>[your-skill-id]</code> with the <code>Skill ID</code> you noted above<sup>1</sup></li>
</ol>
<p>This is what allows your Lambda function to be accessed by the specific skill you are building, and not any other.</p>
<p>Your template should look now something like this:</p>
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="yaml">
                    <code slot="code">AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
  AlexaHandler:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      FunctionName: !Sub ${AWS::StackName}-AlexaHandler
      ...
      Policies:
        - AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccess
      Events:
        AlexaSkillEvent:
          Type: AlexaSkill
          SkillId: amzn1.ask.skill.some-long-numbers-and-letters
Parameters:
  ...
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><p>If you want to double-check your formatting, you can refer to our <a href="https://github.com/stackery/alexa-reinvent-quiz/blob/master/template.yaml">SAM template</a> in the tutorial repo.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>If everything looks right, click the <strong>Commit...</strong> button to commit your changes to your Git repository</li>
<li>Follow the repo link below the stack name to access your newly-created repository</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/p6X5aC2jQcqDDmuQyjcQ" alt="alexa4.png"></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Clone your repo to your computer and open it in your favorite (or least-favorite, we're not particular) IDE</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Add function code</h3>
<p>When you created a function in Stackery, it stubbed out some function code for you in the chosen runtime, which is Node 12 in this case. We're going to replace the function code with the Alexa backend from the <a href="https://github.com/stackery/alexa-reinvent-quiz/">tutorial repo</a>, as well as its <code>package.json</code> contents to add the required dependencies.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <code>your-repo/src/AlexaHandler/index.js</code> and replace its contents with the contents of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackery/alexa-reinvent-quiz/master/src/AlexaHandler/index.js">Stackery's Alexa Skill code</a>. Save the file</li>
<li>Open <code>your-repo/src/AlexaHandler/package.json</code> and replace its contents with the following and save:</li>
</ol>
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="javascript">
                    <code slot="code">{
  "name": "alexahandler",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Stackery",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "aws-sdk": "^2.796.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ask-sdk-core": "^2.9.0",
    "ask-sdk-model": "^1.34.1"
  }
}
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><ol start="3">
<li>Commit the changes and push to your Git repo</li>
</ol>
<p>If you kept your Stackery tab open, you'll have noticed that it detected the changes you pushed up. Go ahead and hit the refresh link:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/kV2cc64TQ2XcWfsWT1f6" alt="alexa5.png"></p>
<h3>4. Deploy to AWS</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the Stackery app, navigate to the <strong>Deploy</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select an environment to deploy to (if this is your first time deploying with Stackery, you'll be guided through linking to AWS first). Click <strong>Prepare new deployment</strong> and then <strong>Prepare Deployment</strong> to start your deployment</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/rQ8rAzWASfG0eKVF3Fd4" alt="alexa-step3.gif"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once the deployment is prepared (which will take about a minute), click <strong>Deploy</strong>. A tab will open in your AWS Console, where you'll need to click <strong>Execute</strong> to kick off the deployment<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/GEnQASVcTrqah2nExmAf" alt="alexa-step4.gif"></p>
<p>This will take a few minutes - get yourself a coffee and a pat on the back, because you're 90% done with deploying your first Alexa Skill!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>You'll get a notification when your stack has deployed. Click the <strong>View</strong> tab to see your live stack</li>
<li>Grab your screenshot for Twitter!</li>
<li>Double-click the <code>AlexaHandler</code> function to pull up some handy data and links.</li>
<li>Copy the function's ARN, as you'll need it for the final step</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/N2pitl1jQwe6gs28hxmY" alt="alexa-step5.gif"></p>
<h3>5. Connect your backend to your Skill</h3>
<p>This is it: the final stage, when we connect all the dots and test our Alexa Skill!</p>
<ol>
<li>Back in the Amazon Developer Console, select <strong>Endpoint</strong> from the menu</li>
<li>Enter the ARN you copied in the previous step like so:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/oWHUCWAYQeLTiyXCeFx1" alt="alexa6.png"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click <strong>Save Endpoints</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you're ready to test your Skill! Navigate to <strong>Test</strong>, and say or type "Start Stackery re:Invent Quiz" to kick off the quiz. You can try the quiz yourself, or get some trivia information about specific AWS services. Knock yourself out - this is the fun part!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/0JO6s23ZRjqStQh6y42u" alt="alexa7.png"></p>
<p>Return to the Stackery Dashboard, notice that your function was successfully invoked while you were testing!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/Xl8eDGDQRy7TSQCCrxdd" alt="alexa8.png"></p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this tutorial piqued your interests in building Alexa Skills. With a Lambda backend, you can build skills in just about any runtime, and Stackery helps you deploy changes quickly (and automatically with our <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/dashboard#deployment-pipeline">Deployment Pipelines</a>).<br>
I'd love to see what you build - feel free to send your projects <a href="https://twitter.com/annaspies">my way on Twitter</a>, and  don't forget to send your deployed stack to <a href="https://twitter.com/stackeryio">Stackery on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><em><sup>1</sup> For the sake of this tutorial, we are hard-coding the Skill ID. <strong>If you are saving your Skill ID directly in the template, make sure your repo is private.</strong> Alternatively, you can use Stackery's <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/environments#setting-parameter-store-values">Environments and Parameter Store</a> to follow best practices and store your Skill ID as in AWS's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html">Systems Manager Parameter Store</a> and reference it at build time.</em></p>
<p><em><sup>2</sup> This tutorial walks you through deploying manually in the browser, but there are other ways to deploy that will likely suit your workflow better. You can deploy with the <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/cli">Stackery CLI</a> with just one command, or completely automate this process upon a merge to the repo's main branch, including automated test runs, with Stackery's <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/dashboard#deployment-pipeline">Deployment Pipelines</a>.</em></p>

<article>
    <p>The objective of river crossing puzzles is to bring items from one river bank to the other in the fewest possible steps.
One prominent puzzle is the <strong>wolf, goat and cabbage problem</strong>.
From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage.
On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat.
But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.
If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The farmer’s challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="minizinc">MiniZinc</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.minizinc.org/">MiniZinc</a> is a high-level constraint modeling language.
It allows you to model optimization and constraint satisfaction problems.
In the backend, one is free to choose from a wide range of solvers.</p>
<h3 id="structure-of-minizinc-models">Structure of MiniZinc Models</h3>
<p>A MiniZinc model consists of <em>parameters</em>, <em>decision variables</em>, <em>constraints</em>, <em>objective</em>, and <em>output</em>.
They all can be specified in any order.</p>
<h4 id="parameters">Parameters</h4>
<p>Parameters define the concrete inputs for the model.
In our river crossing puzzle, the parameters can be defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="minizinc"><span>enum</span> <span>PASSENGER</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Farmer</span><span>,</span> <span>Wolf</span><span>,</span> <span>Goat</span><span>,</span> <span>Cabbage</span><span>};</span>
<span>enum</span> <span>LOC</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>bankA</span><span>,</span> <span>bankB</span><span>};</span>

<span>int</span><span>:</span> <span>maxstep</span> <span>=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span> <span>STEP0</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>..</span><span>maxstep</span><span>;</span>
<span>set</span> <span>of</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span> <span>STEP</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>..</span><span>maxstep</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Apart from the enumerations, the only parameter in this puzzle is <code>maxstep</code>.
It is always a good idea to specify some upper bound for the search space during modeling.
<code>STEP0</code> and <code>STEP1</code> are two helper arrays.
We will need these later.</p>
<h4 id="decision-variables">Decision Variables</h4>
<p>A decision variable represents the unknown solution space.
In our puzzle, we are looking for the farmer’s concrete steps to carry the purchases to the far bank of the river.
In MiniZinc, we can use arrays or <code>var</code> variables to represent the unknown locations at each step:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="minizinc"><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>STEP0</span><span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>LOC</span><span>:</span> <span>farmerLoc</span><span>;</span>
<span>array</span><span>[</span><span>STEP0</span><span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>LOC</span><span>:</span> <span>wolfLoc</span><span>;</span>
<span>array</span><span>[</span><span>STEP0</span><span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>LOC</span><span>:</span> <span>goatLoc</span><span>;</span>
<span>array</span><span>[</span><span>STEP0</span><span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>LOC</span><span>:</span> <span>cabbageLoc</span><span>;</span>

<span>% Helper type: two-dimensional array of the unknown locations.
</span><span></span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>PASSENGER</span><span>,</span> <span>STEP0</span><span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>var</span> <span>LOC</span><span>:</span> <span>loc</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>array2d</span><span>(</span><span>PASSENGER</span><span>,</span> <span>STEP0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>farmerLoc</span> <span>++</span> <span>wolfLoc</span> <span>++</span> <span>goatLoc</span> <span>++</span> <span>cabbageLoc</span><span>);</span>

<span>var</span> <span>STEP</span><span>:</span> <span>end</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>end</code> variable represents the unknown number of steps to solve the puzzle.</p>
<h4 id="constraints">Constraints</h4>
<p>The constraints define the restrictions on the decision variables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage. If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modeling constraints is the most challenging (and fun) part of MiniZinc.
Fortunately, you can use established techniques for modeling common problems.
In the following, we will constrain the farmer’s locations and his purchases at each step to represent the boat crossing the river.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="minizinc"><span>% The farmer arrives at the river with his purchases.
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> <span>forall</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>in</span> <span>PASSENGER</span><span>)(</span><span>loc</span><span>[</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>bankA</span><span>);</span>
<span>% The farmer crosses the river with his purchases after end steps.
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> <span>forall</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>in</span> <span>PASSENGER</span><span>,</span> <span>s</span> <span>in</span> <span>STEP</span> <span>where</span> <span>s</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span>
                 <span>(</span><span>loc</span><span>[</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>s</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>bankB</span><span>);</span>
<span>constraint</span> <span>end</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>maxstep</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>How should we model the crossing of the river?
We can simply iterate over the <code>loc</code> array and constrain the previous and the next location of the farmer and his items.
To avoid code duplication, we can create a <em>predicate</em>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="minizinc"><span>% If the location of a passenger changes from one river bank
</span><span>% to the other, so should change the location of the farmer too.
</span><span>% Note that STEP is 1..maxtep allowing us to access s-1.
</span><span></span><span>predicate</span> <span>passenger_moves</span><span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>PASSENGER</span><span>:</span> <span>p</span><span>,</span> <span>var</span> <span>STEP</span><span>:</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>

          <span>var</span> <span>LOC</span><span>:</span> <span>new_pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>loc</span><span>[</span><span>p</span><span>,</span><span>s</span><span>];</span> <span>}</span> <span>in</span>
          <span>last_pos</span> <span>!=</span> <span>new_pos</span>
          <span>-&gt;</span>
          <span>farmer_last_pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>last_pos</span> <span>/\</span> <span>farmer_new_pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>new_pos</span><span>;</span>
<span>% Constrain all passengers (farmer and his purchases).

</code></pre></div><p>Done!
Let’s finish by adding the two remaining constraints.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="minizinc"><span>% Never leave the wolf with the goat or the goat with the cabbage alone.
</span><span></span><span>constraint</span> <span>forall</span><span>(</span><span>s</span> <span>in</span> <span>STEP</span><span>)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I've implemented some <a href="https://github.com/Gandalf-/coreutils">Unix core utilities in Haskell</a>, and want to start a series of
posts going through the details - starting with simple programs like <code>cat</code>,
<code>seq</code>, and <code>which</code>, and then moving on towards more featureful programs like
<code>uniq</code>, <code>tr</code> and maybe <code>grep</code>.</p>
<p>You can find the full source from this post
<a href="https://github.com/Gandalf-/coreutils/blob/master/Coreutils/Tee.hs">here</a>.
Let's implement <code>tee</code> in Haskell!</p>

<p>What does <code>tee</code> do? From the man page, "read from standard input and write to
standard output and files". Seems simple enough; <code>tee</code> is like <code>cat</code> except
that it additionally writes whatever passes between <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> to any
number of files along the way. Like the majority of coreutils, this is done in
a streaming fashion for performance and to reduce memory usage. It's
unacceptable, for instance, to read all of stdin, then write it to stdout and
each output file in turn. We need to <em>stream</em> the data to each output, or sink,
as it becomes available.</p>

<p>Let's sketch out the program in types to see what we need. We'll use this as a
reference for each section below:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>teeMain</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>String</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>-- ^ parse arguments with defaults, look for errors, call runTee</span>

<span>runTee</span> <span>::</span> <span>Options</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>FilePath</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>-- ^ open handles for each filepath according to provided options, call tee</span>

<span>tee</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>Handle</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>-- ^ read from stdin, write to each provided handle and stdout</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Let's work our way top down, starting with argument parsing, then down to
our runtime, and lastly the business logic.</p>

<p>Our main concern is streaming data, for which Haskell has a couple libraries.
We'll be using <code>streaming</code> and <code>streaming-bytestring</code> which provide
<code>Data.ByteString.Streaming</code>. ByteStrings are the way to go since <code>tee</code> must
behave itself with binary input, and besides we don't need to concern ourselves
with the content of stdin means to move it around. <code>System.Console.GetOpt</code> will
handle argument parsing, while the other <code>System</code> and <code>Control</code> libraries
provide some basics: <code>bracket</code>, <code>unless</code>, <code>die</code>, <code>openBinaryFile</code>, open flags,
and <code>Handle</code>. We'll see how these are each used in the following sections.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>module</span> <span>Coreutils.Tee</span> <span>where</span>

<span>import</span>           <span>Control.Exception</span>
<span>import</span>           <span>Control.Monad</span>
<span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>Data.ByteString.Streaming</span> <span>as</span> <span>Q</span>
<span>import</span>           <span>System.Console.GetOpt</span>
<span>import</span>           <span>System.Exit</span>
<span>import</span>           <span>System.IO</span>
</pre></div>

<p>BSD <code>tee</code> has just two options</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-a</code> to append to output files rather than overwriting them</li>
<li><code>-i</code> to ignore SIGINT</li>
</ul>
<p>GNU tee has some more options related to error path behavior, but let's ignore
those and BSD's <code>-i</code> for the time being. This leaves us with three things to do
in our argument parsing:</p>
<ul>
<li>look for help flags to show usage</li>
<li>look for <code>-a</code> or <code>--append</code> to indicate append mode for writing</li>
<li>collect everything else as output file names</li>
</ul>
<p><code>System.Console.GetOpt</code> provides a simple pattern to describe this exactly, we
provide a data type describing our options (in this case, just one), the
defaults, and some help text and it'll figure out the details internally.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>newtype</span> <span>Options</span> <span>=</span> <span>Options</span> <span>{</span> <span>optMode</span> <span>::</span> <span>IOMode</span> <span>}</span>

<span>defaults</span> <span>=</span> <span>Options</span> <span>{</span> <span>optMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>WriteMode</span> <span>}</span>

<span>options</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>OptDescr</span> <span>(</span><span>Options</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Either</span> <span>String</span> <span>Options</span><span>)]</span>

        <span>(</span><span>NoArg</span>
            <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>opt</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Right</span> <span>opt</span> <span>{</span> <span>optMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppendMode</span> <span>}))</span>
        <span>"append to given files, do not overwrite"</span>

    <span>,</span> <span>Option</span> <span>"h"</span> <span>[</span><span>"help"</span><span>]</span>
        <span>(</span><span>NoArg</span>

        <span>"show this help text"</span>
    <span>]</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>getOpt</code> automatically tracks which arguments aren't parsed and provides those
separately, perfect for our usecase. Let's plug this all together in our pseudo
main function.</p>

<p>where <code>options</code> describes the flags we're looking to parse, and <code>args</code> are the
command line arguments, as per <code>System.Environment.getArgs</code>. Once parsed, we
check for errors, apply defaults with <code>foldM (flip id) defaults opts</code>, and run.
The <code>foldM</code> has a bit going on, let's break that down by specializing the
arguments one at a time.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>*</span><span>Coreutils</span><span>.</span><span>Tee</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>foldM</span>

<span>*</span><span>Coreutils</span><span>.</span><span>Tee</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>foldM</span> <span>(</span><span>flip</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>defaults</span>
<span>foldM</span> <span>(</span><span>flip</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>defaults</span>
  <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Foldable</span> <span>t</span><span>,</span> <span>Monad</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>Options</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>Options</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>Options</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What about <code>opts</code>? We can see the types align with <code>getOpt</code>'s first tuple if
our Foldable is a list and Monad is Either. This makes sense from a higher
level too; we have multiple "combine-able" operations (parsing flags) that can
succeed (provide an <code>Option</code>) or fail (provide a <code>String</code> error message). All
together, this executes the parsing functions <code>opts</code> in turn to build an
<code>Either String Options</code>, filling in the blanks with our defaults as necessary.</p>
<p>When we're all done, we have <code>Options</code> and a list of everything else not parsed
which we can use as the list of output filenames.</p>

<p>Let's take a look back and see what we're supposed to do next.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>runTee</span> <span>::</span> <span>Options</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>FilePath</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>-- ^ open handles for each filepath according to provided options, call tee</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So we have our options and filenames, and need to convert those into handles to
call the next layer. To properly manage our resources (these handles), we need
to close them too. Breaking these steps out in a <code>do</code> block would work most of
the time, but would leak if we hit an exception. On Linux, this isn't such a
big deal - the process exiting will close all the handles. However on Windows
(which we can support for free thanks to Haskell's IO libraries), not closing
the handles can mean that data doesn't get written. To that point, Haskell uses
exceptions to communicate IO errors, the exact type of errors we're likely to
encounter opening and writing to files. Luckily, <code>bracket</code> is perfect for this
situation; let's check it out.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>*</span><span>Coreutils</span><span>.</span><span>Tee</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>bracket</span>
<span>bracket</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>c</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Provided some IO computation that produces resources, a function that uses
those resources, and a function that releases those resources, <code>bracket</code> will
run everything together, ensuring that the resources are released even if
there's an exception while they're being used.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>runTee</span> <span>::</span> <span>Options</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>FilePath</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>runTee</span> <span>o</span> <span>fs</span> <span>=</span>
        <span>bracket</span> <span>acquire</span> <span>release</span> <span>tee</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>acquire</span> <span>=</span> <span>mapM</span> <span>(`</span><span>openBinaryFile</span><span>`</span> <span>optMode</span> <span>o</span><span>)</span> <span>fs</span>
        <span>release</span> <span>=</span> <span>mapM_</span> <span>hClose</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Pretty easy!</p>

<p>So now we have our collection of handles, time to use them to do some real
work. Let's see it all together, then break it down.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>tee</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>Handle</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>-- build up n computations that copy the stream and write it a file</span>
<span>tee</span> <span>=</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span> <span>.</span> <span>foldr</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>h</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>toHandle</span> <span>h</span> <span>.</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>copy</span><span>)</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>Data.ByteString.Streaming</code> usage works right to left, where the right side is
the source of the stream, and the left side is the sink, where the data ends
up. The space between is where we can mutate the stream. The simplest <code>tee</code> is
with no files, in which it's just a simplified <code>cat</code> that only reads from
<code>stdin</code>. To describe that with these streams, that'd be:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>*</span><span>Coreutils</span><span>.</span><span>Tee</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>let</span> <span>cat</span> <span>=</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span>
<span>*</span><span>Coreutils</span><span>.</span><span>Tee</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>cat</span>
<span>cat</span> <span>::</span> <span>Control</span><span>.</span><span>Monad</span><span>.</span><span>IO</span><span>.</span><span>Class</span><span>.</span><span>MonadIO</span> <span>m</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>m</span> <span>()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Take everything from stdin and stream it to stdout. For our purposes, <code>m</code> is
<code>IO</code>, nothing else is needed here. We can specialize our types to see this
ourselves, and that we're going to fit into the prototype we sketched out
initially for <code>tee</code>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>*</span><span>Coreutils</span><span>.</span><span>Tee</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>let</span> <span>cat</span> <span>=</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>stdout</span> <span>Q</span><span>.</span><span>stdin</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
<span>*</span><span>Coreutils</span><span>.</span><span>Tee</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>cat</span>
<span>cat</span> <span>::</span> <span>IO</span> <span>()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now, for writing streams to handles we have <code>Q.toHandle</code>, but this has a
problem - it acts like a sink, consuming all of the input stream. This won't
work, since the input from <code>stdin</code> will never make it to <code>stdout</code>. We can't
read the stream twice either; for a file we could read everything twice, it
would just be wasteful, but for <code>stdin</code> it's not possible - the data only
exists once.</p>
<p>The library has something for us though: <code>Q.copy</code> forks a stream, allowing you
to do two separate, independent computations on it. Internally, this is
essentially sending the chunks that make up the input stream two different
places, creating two streams from one.</p>
<p>Let's build up a <code>cat</code> the preserves the input stream beyond writing to stdout
rather than consuming it.</p>

<p>While we're here thinking about stdout, let's note that <code>Q.stdout</code> isn't doing
anything magical compared to <code>Q.tohandle</code>, just sparing us some typing. This is
useful, because it let's us treat stdout as "just another output", the same as
the handles we're creating.</p>

<p>With our stream copying ability, we can create a waterfall of streams! stdin to
the first handle + new stream 1, new stream 1 to the second handle + new stream
2, and so on until the last stream, which just goes to stdout.</p>
<p>Good old <code>foldr</code> matches this pattern well; take some initial value, run a
computation on it with the first input to produce an output, then use that as
the new initial value for the second input value, and so on.</p>

      <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/index.xml"><i></i></a>
      
      

        

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/identity-based-management-header.png" width="100%" alt="iceberg with identity layers"></p>

<p>The maturation of software development has been driven by the increasing segmentation of functions into their own portable environments. Infrastructure is splintered into dozens of computing resources, physical servers, containers, databases, Kubernetes pods, dashboards, etc. Such compartmentalization has made it incredibly simple for developers to enter their desired environments with minimal disruption to other working parts. To keep this rapid pace of development, sysadmins, SREs, and their counterparts are tasked with supporting dynamic infrastructure capable of responding to the DevOps process, whether this be automation or access.</p>

<p>Tasked with stitching together a fluid network of compute environments, operators often find themselves struggling with the same problem of how to maintain meaningful control of or visibility into activity. Dealing with hundreds of remote engineers accessing thousands of ephemeral instances over different transport protocols produces an overwhelming number of users, secrets, and sessions that all require tracking and logging.</p>

<p>Identity management solutions have helped somewhat. Being able to SSO into apps like Slack or Jenkins adds some much-needed finesse, but are incomplete in coverage. The next iteration will be to use the same identity object to authorize privileged access to servers, clusters, apps, databases, desktops, routers, and every other possible cloud resource. The aim should be to <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/application-access-announcement/"><em>unify</em> access</a> controls across the entire stack, not just the outermost layer: a single place to define, enforce, view, and manage global auth. To understand why the next big step will inevitably head in this direction, we will look at some common pain points, how they’ve been exploited, and how identity-based management can release pressure.</p>

<h2 id="secret-sprawl">Secret sprawl</h2>

<p>When a server is presented with a valid secret, it holds an important assumption that the bearer on the other end of the exchange is not a fraud. Possession is a proxy for identity. We know this is not true - secrets have a nasty habit of getting around. Why? Because it’s convenient.</p>

<p>Internal security teams will preach that the “correct” method is to issue a secret per user, but that would inevitably bury developers under a mound of credentials. It’s faster to just share secrets by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/09/27/pupil_mental_health_tracking_app_security_fears/">hardcoding</a> them into an application or storing them in <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-bug-exposed-passwords-in-plaintext/">plaintext</a> in <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/twilio-security-incident-shows-danger-of-misconfigured-s3-buckets/d/d-id/1338447">S3 Buckets</a> for ease of use. Amplifying this threat vector, modern infrastructure generates a mountain of secrets daily. Each cloud <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/compute-services.html">compute service</a> mints its own set of keys. Agile methodology and supporting DevOps tools means <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-z-of-devops-managing-multiple-environments-with-the-help-of-these-tools-n6x3thm">bespoke deployment environments</a> for all teams. And yes, while secret management tools help contain the sheer volume of secrets, some will be leaked, misconfigured, lost, shared, or stolen.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/supercomputers-hacked-across-europe-to-mine-cryptocurrency">European supercomputer hijacking</a> earlier this year provided a cautionary tale in sharing secrets. Supercomputers are a utility, providing unparalleled computational power to an ecosystem of users. In this case, these users included institutions working on COVID-19 research. Universities in China, Canada, and Poland had all been issued SSH keys, which were shared between academics within their respective universities. These credentials were then <a href="https://csirt.egi.eu/academic-data-centers-abused-for-crypto-currency-mining/">stolen</a> and used in a coordinated attack on multiple supercomputers to mine cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The problem is abstraction. Secrets are an abstract representation of a user and can switch hands. They are one-dimensional codes that map to a <em>persona</em>, not a person - the “what,” not the “who.” In the supercomputer incident, the persona was a group of academics within a university. And so when hackers presented a valid SSH key, the supercomputer did not - and could not - notice the fraud.</p>

<h2 id="endpoint-propagation">Endpoint propagation</h2>

<p>Almost anything can be referred to as a “workspace” nowadays. There is an expectation that employees will need access to computing resources in highly variable circumstances. <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/surviving-the-upside-down/">In 2020</a>, trends like remote work and using personal devices were shoved into normalcy, circumventing many of the defenses that cybersecurity professionals relied on. Combine this with compute infrastructure that has been divided across different computing environments (VMs, Docker, Kubernetes), and it’s plausible for an engineer to want to peek into a running container at midnight from the in-laws a couple states over.</p>

<p>Dependably, we can turn to cryptocurrencies for another case study. Hacking a computing resource to run a crypto-mining rig has become a <a href="https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/cryptojacking-invades-cloud-how-modern-containerization-trend-is-exploited-by-attackers/">profitable hobby</a> for some years now. It does not take long to find examples of poor access hygiene in carelessly exposed endpoints. Hosts with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacking-group-is-hijacking-docker-systems-with-exposed-api-endpoints/">exposed Docker APIs</a> we used to create and run containers with mining rigs. <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/how-kubeflow-clusters-were-targeted-recently-by-hackers-for-crypto-mining/">One attack</a> accomplished the same feat through an opening to Kubeflow clusters. Tesla’s <a href="https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla">passwordless Kubernetes console</a> added the company to a growing list of victims of similar circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="permeable-boundaries">Permeable boundaries</h2>

<p>Once attackers had found their way into one of Tesla’s Kubernetes pods, they would come to find a set of credentials to an Amazon S3 bucket hiding in plain sight (Figure 1). Computing resources do not exist in a vacuum. They are intimately networked together. Hopping from one environment to another just requires an open port and a short protocol ride. If someone had infiltrated your network, how easy would it be for an intruder to scan for vulnerable databases, like the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018.09.06%20GAO%20Equifax%20report.pdf">Equifax hack</a>? Or how about secrets scattered across internal wikis, like <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/twitter-hack/">Twitter</a>? How long would it take to move between a third-party vendor’s system into credit card information, like <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/">Target</a>?</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/identity-based-management-1.png" width="100%" alt="screenshot of exposed tesla credentials"></p>

<p><a href="https://redlock.io/blog/cryptojacking-tesla">Figure 1: Exposed credentials to Tesla’s AWS environment</a></p>

<p>Each layer of abstraction creates its own station for cyberthreats to gather and wait to be ferried elsewhere. Figure 2 stacks these different layers together, showing us where someone can enter from and where they can break out to. Take this post on <a href="https://neuvector.com/container-security/hack-kubernetes-container/">hacking a Kubernetes cluster</a>, exploiting the same <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5638">vulnerability</a> used at Equifax. The author, Dieter, hacks a small Kubernetes cluster housing an app container for Apache Struts. Scanning with netcat for an open port, he is able to run a script with the exploit and inject a command that connects a reverse shell! What should he do next? Run a container as root? Deposit an SSH key? Break out of the cluster into the host?</p>

<p>The point is not that everything is compromised all of the time. Rather, even if networks are staunchly guarded, clients and hosts are configured without mistake, and secrets are encrypted, there can still be unforeseeable events that make use of innately permeable boundaries. By constructing IT systems with plug-and-play building blocks, we inadvertently create a giant digital maze with way too many entrances and not enough dead ends.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/identity-based-management-2.png" width="100%" alt="orchestration architecture diagram"></p>

<p><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/what-is-container-orchestration">Figure 2: Orchestration Architecture</a></p>

<h2 id="cloudy-and-poor-visibility">Cloudy and poor visibility</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever skied during a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteout_(weather)">whiteout</a>, you’ve experienced firsthand how terrifying it is to speed down a mountain while snow obscures any meaningful visibility. The only way to avoid obstacles is to get within range, close range. It’s not so different from administering remote access. Instead of dodging trees and cliffs, professionals are looking for abnormal behavior with blinders on. They are unable to answer the questions, “Who ran that query in my database?” “How many of my employees can access customer data? Who is currently in my production environment?”</p>

<p>Earlier, I pointed out that a secret can represent a user, but tells us very little <em>about</em> the user. This gets to the heart of the problem - access is <em>not</em> granted from identity information about the user, i.e. What is their name? What team are they on? What role do they play? Are they a vendor or a contractor? What’s off limits? Instead, we use representative information of who the user persona <em>might</em> be. Unable to limit access based on “who,” we rely on the “whats,” proxy information like valid keys, IP addresses, or just plain username and passwords. And because users lack unique characteristics, they cannot easily be discerned from the other people and machines going about their business.</p>

<h2 id="govern-access-beyond-saas-with-identity">Govern access beyond SaaS with identity</h2>

<p>Some companies have gotten ahead of this trend and switched to a model that counsels <a href="https://modernedgetechnologies.com/2017/11/07/access-control/">identity-based access</a>. The method is aptly named. Access does not depend on presenting the right credentials. Instead, a personal profile of the user gets fed through a policy that divines permissions from descriptive data, like those in the previous paragraph. Because of identity providers, like Okta, Active Directory, Keycloak, etc. identity data is centrally housed, making it a reliable information source to help guide decisions.</p>

<p>Identity-based access is mostly limited to the realm of web apps and services. When we think of IDPs, we’re primarily concerned with logins to email or workplace tools for new hires, but that’s just one component of the overall architecture (topmost layer of Figure 2). For the longest time, sysadmins did not have to worry too much about remote access protocols, as engineers were co-located with the services they used. But now, we use a dozen different SaaS tools, which is why SSO is everyone’s best friend. But if your engineering teams are still sharing static <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/comparing-ssh-keys/">SSH keys</a> or database credentials, let alone leaving a public dashboard without a password, the most catastrophic threats still loom.</p>

<p>More concretely, what I mean by consolidating access is a digital command center to manage authentication and authorization between web apps, Kubernetes clusters, databases, and servers <em>all in one place</em>. We do not currently do this, and it’s no surprise that we don’t! There’s no consistency across different remote access protocols. It’s easy to bundle SaaS applications into a universal SSO flow because they all travel over HTTP. But HTTP is a different beast from SSH or LDAP. Logging into email is an entirely different process from using an SSH key. But when Maurice checks his inbox or …</p></article></div>

To ensure that the list of strengths you list is balanced, ask your manager, close friends or trusted colleagues to honestly list three of your top strengths and add them to your list.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Examples of strengths are:</strong> strong communication skills, problem solving skills, high emotional intelligence, collaboration skills and so on.</p><h3><strong>2. List your weaknesses.</strong></h3><p>If you aren’t sure about what your weaknesses are, think about things you avoid at work, or look for hints in feedback from your boss or colleagues. Are you always the butt of jokes for always being late or disorganised? Perhaps you can list those as weaknesses.</p><p>Like you did with strengths above, ask your boss, close friends or trusted colleagues to honestly list three of your weaknesses so that you have a balanced list.</p><p><strong>Examples of weaknesses are:</strong> procrastination, fear of addressing large groups of people, being disorganised or a lack of technical skills.</p><h3><strong>3. List the opportunities and threats that apply to you.</strong></h3><p>Opportunities and Threats are external factors that individuals cannot really control. An example of a Threat could be a decrease in sales because of unforeseen global factors (such as the<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/spotlight/economics-insights-analysis.html"> Covid-19 pandemic</a> in 2020 or the development of a sudden<a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/the-us-china-trade-war-a-timeline/"> trade war</a> like the one that broke out between the US and China in 2018) or the introduction of new technology by a new competitor (for instance,<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-netflix-bankrupted-and-destroyed-blockbuster-infographic-2011-3?r=US&amp;IR=T"> how Netflix destroyed Blockbuster</a>).</p><p>An example of an Opportunity could be an internal training program to brush up your technical skills or sales training. A colleague who is more qualified than you could also be a threat to your career advancement in the company. In this context, you can seize the opportunity to take weekend or online classes to bring your qualifications up to speed.<strong></strong></p></div></div>]]>

    <p>One of the first things we did in setting up the company was create a repo
named "rfd." This repo houses our requests for discussion. Bryan teased this to
the internet...</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To the point of this piece, the first thing we actually built at <a href="https://twitter.com/oxidecomputer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@oxidecomputer</a> was infrastructure for design documentation and discussion -- which, like many problems, is peskier than it might seem! <a href="https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I">https://t.co/w8ecNNUN0I</a></p>— Bryan Cantrill (@bcantrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1286005213065703424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>...and folks asked for our process, so we are going to share it!</p>
<p>The best way to
describe RFDs is with "RFD 1 Requests for Discussion." Below is that RFD.</p>

<p>Writing down ideas is important:  it allows them to be rigorously formulated
(even while nascent), candidly discussed and transparently shared.
We capture the written expression of an idea in a <strong>Request for Discussion</strong>
(RFD), a document in the original spirit of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">IETF Request for Comments</a>,
as expressed by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3">RFC 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The content of a note may be any thought, suggestion, etc.
related to the software or other aspect of the network.
Notes are encouraged to be timely rather than polished.
Philosophical positions without examples or other specifics, specific suggestions
or implementation techniques without introductory or background explication, and
explicit questions without any attempted answers are all acceptable.
The minimum length for a note is one sentence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These standards (or lack of them) are stated explicitly for two reasons.
First, there is a tendency to view a written statement as ipso facto authoritative,
and we hope to promote the exchange and discussion of considerably less than
authoritative ideas.
Second, there is a natural hesitancy to publish something unpolished,
and we hope to ease this inhibition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar to RFCs, our philosophy of RFDs is to allow both timely discussion of
rough ideas, while still becoming a permanent repository for more established ones.
Depending on their state, RFDs may be quickly iterated on in a branch,
discussed actively as part of a pull request to be merged, or commented upon
after having been published.
The workflow for the RFD process for is based upon those of the Golang
proposal process, Joyent RFD process, Rust RFC process, and Kubernetes
proposal process.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-an-rfd">When to use an RFD</h2>
<p>The following are examples of when an RFD is appropriate, these are intended to
be broad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add or change a company process</li>
<li>An architectural or design decision for hardware or software</li>
<li>Change to an API or command-line tool used by customers</li>
<li>Change to an internal API or tool</li>
<li>Change to an internal process</li>
<li>A design for testing</li>
</ul>
<p>RFDs not only apply to technical ideas but overall company ideas and processes
as well.
If you have an idea to improve the way something is being done as a company,
you have the power to make your voice heard by adding to discussion.</p>

<p>At the start of every RFD document, we'd like to include a brief amount of metadata.
The metadata format is based on the
<a href="https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/metadata">python-markdown2</a> metadata format.
It'd look like:</p>
<pre><code>---
authors: Andy Smith &lt;andy@example.computer&gt;, Neal Jones &lt;neal@example.computer&gt;
state: prediscussion
---
</code></pre>
<p>We keep track of three pieces of metadata:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>authors</code>: The authors (and therefore owners) of an RFD.
They should be listed with their name and e-mail address.</li>
<li><code>state</code>: Must be one of the states discussed below.</li>
<li><code>discussion</code>: For RFDs that are in or beyond the <code>discussion</code> state, this should be a link to the PR to integrate the RFD;
see below for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>An RFD can be in one of the following six states:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>prediscussion</code></li>
<li><code>ideation</code></li>
<li><code>discussion</code></li>
<li><code>published</code></li>
<li><code>committed</code></li>
<li><code>abandoned</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A document in the <code>prediscussion</code> state indicates that the work is not yet
ready for discussion, but that the RFD is effectively a placeholder.
The <code>prediscussion</code> state signifies that work iterations are being done
quickly on the RFD in its branch in order to advance the RFD to the <code>discussion</code> state.</p>
<p>A document in the <code>ideation</code> state contains only a description of the topic
that the RFD will cover, providing an indication of the scope of the eventual
RFD.  Unlike the <code>prediscussion</code> state, there is no expectation that it is
undergoing active revision. Such a document can be viewed as a scratchpad for
related ideas.  Any member of the team is encouraged to start active
development of such an RFD (moving it to the <code>prediscussion</code> state) with or
without the participation of the original author. It is critical that RFDs in
the <code>ideation</code> state are clear and narrowly defined.</p>
<p>Documents under active discussion should be in the <code>discussion</code> state.
At this point a discussion is being had for the RFD in a Pull Request.</p>
<p>Once (or if) discussion has converged and the Pull Request is ready to be merged,
it should be updated to the <code>published</code> state before merge.
Note that just because something is in the <code>published</code> state does not mean that
it cannot be updated and corrected.
See the  <a href="#making-changes-to-an-rfd">Making changes to an RFD</a> section for more
information.</p>
<p>The <code>prediscussion</code> state should be viewed as essentially a collaborative
extension of an engineer's notebook, and the <code>discussion</code> state should be used
when an idea is being actively discussed.
These states shouldn't be used for ideas that have been committed to,
organizationally or otherwise;
by the time an idea represents the consensus or direction, it should be in
the <code>published</code> state.</p>
<p>Once an idea has been entirely implemented, it should be in the <code>committed</code> state.
Comments on ideas in the <code>committed</code> state should generally be raised as issues --
but if the comment represents a call for a significant divergence from or
extension to committed functionality, a new RFD may be called for;
as in all things, use your best judgment.</p>
<p>Finally, if an idea is found to be non-viable (that is, deliberately never
implemented) or if an RFD should be otherwise indicated that it should be
ignored, it can be moved into the <code>abandoned</code> state.</p>
<p>We will go over this in more detail.
Let's walk through the life of a RFD.</p>
<h2 id="rfd-life-cycle">RFD life-cycle</h2>
<p>There is a <em>prototype</em> script in this repository, <code>scripts/new.sh</code>, that will
automate the process.</p>
<pre><code>$ scripts/new.sh 0042 "My title here"
</code></pre>
<p>If you wish to create a new RFD by hand, or understand the process in greater
detail, read on.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Never at anytime through the process do you push directly to the
master branch. Once your pull request (PR) with your RFD in your branch is
merged into master, then the RFD will appear in the master branch.</p>
<h3 id="reserve-a-rfd-number">Reserve a RFD number</h3>
<p>You will first need to reserve the number you wish to use for your RFC.
This number should be the next available RFD number from looking at the
current <code>git branch -r</code> output.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-branch-for-your-rfd">Create a branch for your RFD</h3>
<p>Now you will need to create a new git branch, named after the RFD number you wish to reserve.
This number should have leading zeros if less than 4 digits.
Before creating the branch, verify that it does not already exist:</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -rl *0042
</code></pre>
<p>If you see a branch there (but not a corresponding sub-directory in <code>rfd</code> in
master), it is possible that the RFD is currently being created;
stop and check with co-workers before proceeding!
Once you have verified that the branch doesn't exist, create it locally and
switch to it:</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout -b 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="create-a-placeholder-rfd">Create a placeholder RFD</h3>
<p>Now create a placeholder RFD.
You can do so with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir -p rfd/0042
$ cp prototypes/prototype.md rfd/0042/README.md
# OR IF YOU PREFER asciidoc
$ cp prototypes/prototype.adoc rfd/0042/README.adoc
</code></pre>
<p>Fill in the RFD number and title placeholders in the new doc and add your name as an author.
The status of the RFD at this point should be <code>prediscussion</code>.</p>
<p>If your preference is to use asciidoc, that is acceptable as well, however the examples in this flow will assume markdown.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Push your changes to your RFD branch in the RFD repo.</p>
<pre><code>$ git add rfd/0042/README.md
$ git commit -m '0042: Adding placeholder for RFD &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<p>After your branch is pushed, the table in the README on the master branch will
update automatically with the new RFD. If you ever change the name of the RFD in the future,
the table will update as well. Whenever information about the state of the RFD
changes, this updates the table as well. The single source of truth for
information about the RFD comes from the RFD in the branch until it is merged.</p>
<h3 id="iterate-on-your-rfd-in-your-branch">Iterate on your RFD in your branch</h3>
<p>Now, you can work on writing your RFD in your branch.</p>
<pre><code>$ git checkout 0042
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can gather your thoughts and get your RFD to a state where you would
like to get feedback and discuss with others.
It's recommended to push your branch remotely to make sure the changes you make
stay in sync with the remote in case your local gets damaged.</p>
<p>It is up to you as to whether you would like to squash all your commits down to
one before opening up for feedback, or if you would like to keep the commit
history for the sake of history.</p>
<h3 id="discuss-your-rfd">Discuss your RFD</h3>
<p>When you are ready to get feedback on your RFD, make sure all your local
changes are pushed to the remote branch.
At this point you are likely at the stage where you will want to change the
status of the RFD from <code>prediscussion</code> to <code>discussion</code> for a fully formed
RFD or to <code>ideation</code> for one where only the topic is specified.
Do this in your branch.</p>
<h3 id="push-your-rfd-branch-remotely-2">Push your RFD branch remotely</h3>
<p>Along with your RFD content, update the RFD's state to <code>discussion</code> in your branch, then:</p>
<pre><code>$ git commit -am '0042: Add RFD for &lt;Title&gt;'
$ git push origin 0042
</code></pre>
<h3 id="open-a-pull-request">Open a Pull Request</h3>
<p>Open a pull request on GitHub to merge your branch, in this case <code>0042</code> into the master branch.</p>
<p>If you move your RFD into <code>discussion</code> but fail to open a pull request, a friendly
bot …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>This article covers one crucial piece of every distributed system: visibility. At AppsFlyer, we call ourselves metrics obsessed and truly believe that you cannot know what you cannot see.</p>
<p>We provide rich dashboards, collect and visualize logs, simplify the creation of client-level metrics, and create a holistic overview of systems in order to detect and debug problems, analyze performance, and identify long-term trends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had an internal blind spot that made it more challenging to deliver these products: we lacked a human-readable and actionable Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> lag monitoring system.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-at-appsflyer"><a id="kafka-at-appsflyer"></a>Apache Kafka at AppsFlyer</h2>
<p>AppsFlyer is a SaaS mobile marketing, analytics, and attribution platform. We help app marketers make better decisions on their running campaigns using a variety of tools found in our platform.</p>
<p>Since 2014, Apache Kafka has served as a core piece of AppsFlyer’s large-scale event-driven architecture, running data pipelines that stream tens of billions of events on a daily basis. AppsFlyer leverages Kafka in a number of ways, with Kafka running our most important workflows. If data is the blood of AppsFlyer, then Kafka is our circulatory system.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/partners-clients-1.png" alt="Batch Analytics | Partners | Clients" width="1000" height="761" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/partners-clients-1.png 1000w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/partners-clients-1-300x228.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/partners-clients-1-768x584.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/partners-clients-1-344x262.png 344w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/partners-clients-1-600x457.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>The diagram above is a simple overview of AppsFlyer’s architecture, and each line represents a different flow in the system. Some of the data is used, replicated, and enriched, while other data is stored in various databases for attribution, batch analytics, and more. At the end of the funnel are two services that consume all the data from the end-of-the-line Kafka clusters and store it into S3 using an in-house streaming service and Pinterest Secor.</p>
<p>All of this is translated into more than 1 million incoming HTTP requests per second and 150+ billion events per day spread across more than 20 Kafka clusters.</p>
<p>Before going into more detail, let’s first go over some basic Kafka terms and concepts.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-basics"><a id="kafka-basics"></a>Kafka basics</h2>
<p>Kafka is used for building real-time data pipelines and event streaming applications. An <em>offset</em> is a simple integer that Kafka uses to identify a position in the log. <em>Lag</em> is simply the delta between the last produced message and the last consumer’s committed offset.&nbsp;Today, offsets are stored in a special topic called <code>__consumer_offsets</code>. Prior to version 0.9, Kafka used to save offsets in ZooKeeper itself.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Offset+Management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Offset Management</a> proposal document, the Kafka Core team describes this implementation as a kind of “marriage of convenience” since Kafka is already heavily dependent on ZooKeeper for various purposes like cluster membership, elections, and configuration storage. Now, there are few services that implement their own offset management and store it in ZooKeeper itself. A good example of this is <a href="https://github.com/pinterest/secor/blob/master/DESIGN.md#offset-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest Secor</a>, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>There is, however, a flaw with this implementation: The problems associated with it become more apparent when you use thousands of partitions and hundreds of consumers. ZooKeeper is not built to serve high-write load such as offset storage. Therefore, the Kafka Core team decided to create a new special topic called <code>__consumer_offsets</code>. This topic allows offset management to be consistent, fault tolerant, and partitioned across the Kafka cluster itself. In fact, one of the most anticipated Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs) is <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KIP-500</a>, which will remove the dependency on ZooKeeper completely. After KIP-500 is implemented, Kafka will manage its own metadata internally in a more scalable and robust way, and it will omit the option to use ZooKeeper-based consumers.</p>
<h2 id="offset-storage"><a id="offset-storage"></a>How does offset storage work?</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-broker-group-coordinator-1.png" alt="Kafka Cluster | Broker | Application | OffsetCommitRequest" width="1000" height="375" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-broker-group-coordinator-1.png 1000w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-broker-group-coordinator-1-300x113.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-broker-group-coordinator-1-768x288.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-broker-group-coordinator-1-350x131.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-broker-group-coordinator-1-600x225.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>When the group coordinator—a broker that is selected to manage the state of a given consumer group—receives an <code>OffsetCommitRequest</code> by the application, it appends the request to the <code>__consumer_offsets</code> topic, which is then replicated to other Kafka brokers in the cluster based on the <code>offsets.topic.replication.factor</code> config parameter. This specifies the replication factor of the offset topic and affects the amount of brokers the offset commit will be replicated to.</p>
<p>The offset commit can be controlled from the broker configuration. You can set the <code>offsets.commit.required.acks</code>, which stands for the number of acknowledgments that are required before the offset commit can be accepted, as well as <code>offsets.commit.timeout.ms</code>, which defaults to five seconds.</p>
<p>The simplest way to check the offsets and lag of a given consumer group is by using the CLI tools provided with Kafka.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap-1024x183.png" alt="kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server" width="1024" height="183" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap-1024x183.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap-300x54.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap-768x137.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap-1536x275.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap-350x63.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap-600x107.png 600w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-consumer-groups-bootstrap.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>In the diagram above, you can see the details on a consumer group called <code>my-group</code>. The command output shows the details per partition within the topic. Two main columns that are worth mentioning are the <code>CURRENT-OFFSET</code>, which is the current max offset of the consumer on a given partition, and the <code>LOG-END-OFFSET</code>, which is the offset of the latest message in the partition.</p>
<h2 id="lag"><a id="lag"></a>Why does lag matter?</h2>
<p>Why does lag matter and why does it need to be treated differently than other metrics in the system?</p>
<p>Lag is a key performance indicator (KPI) for Kafka. When building an event streaming platform, the consumer group lag is one of the crucial metrics to monitor.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, when an application consumes messages from Kafka, it commits its offset in order to keep its position in the partition. When a consumer gets stuck for any reason—for example, an error, rebalance, or even a complete stop—it can resume from the last committed offset and continue from the same point in time.</p>
<p>Therefore, lag is the delta between the last committed message to the last produced message. In other words, lag indicates how far behind your application is in processing up-to-date information.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, remember that Kafka persistence is based on retention, meaning that if your lag persists, you will lose data at some point in time. The goal is to keep lag to a minimum.</p>
<h2 id="what-did-we-have"><a id="what-did-we-have"></a>What did we have?</h2>
<p>A few years ago, when Kafka became a crucial piece of AppsFlyer’s infrastructure, we created a Clojure service called <code>Kafka-Monitor</code>. It was essentially a simple wrapper around the built-in Kafka CLI tools that were mentioned before, which parsed the values and sent it to our metrics stack. Although it worked fine, it was hard to maintain, error prone, and not scalable at all.</p>
<p>We also recognized that something was missing. Just imagine a situation where you get a PagerDuty alert on Kafka lag in the middle of the night. You barely wake up, open the laptop lid, and try to understand what’s going on in your system.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor-1024x280.png" alt="Kafka Lag Monitor | Total Lag" width="1024" height="280" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor-1024x280.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor-300x82.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor-768x210.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor-1536x420.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor-350x96.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor-600x164.png 600w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-lag-monitor.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p>
<p>In such a scenario, the last thing that you want to do is to start debugging and calculating the lag, calculating the retention time, and figuring out what you should do next.</p>
<p>This information should already be as descriptive, clear, and actionable as possible. The fact that the lag is represented by a number means very little. Does a 40,000 message lag mean five seconds? Five minutes? Is there a risk of losing data because of retention?</p>
<p>This was the blindspot that needed to be addressed.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-wanted-to-achieve"><a id="what-we-wanted-to-achieve"></a>What did we want to achieve?</h2>
<p>When planning for a better solution for lag monitoring, the following needs were defined for the new solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation:</strong> We wouldn’t need to change config files and deploy the service every time a new consumer group that we want to monitor starts to consume from the cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Regex filter</strong>: We want the ability to control which consumer group to monitor based on a predefined regular expression (e.g., filter out test consumers, and the <code>console_consumers</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Support ZooKeeper consumers:</strong> We want a solution that will track both <code>__consumer_offsets</code> as well as ZooKeeper consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable:</strong> AppsFlyer scale continues to grow every single day. Thus, we need a solution that will scale and has a small footprint so we can deploy it for each cluster and scale it horizontally as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a metrics perspective, we wanted the ability to control and build our own calculations and alerts because we use Kafka for different use cases and have different monitoring stacks. The <code>raw</code> metrics that we searched for included per-partition, per-consumer-group, and per-topic metrics. These metrics provide flexibility for lag monitoring and alerting, and help create lag monitoring that actually means something.</p>
<h2 id="options"><a id="options"></a>What options did we consider?</h2>
<p>With those guidelines, we started to explore and test a few of the available solutions.<br>
The prominent ones were:</p>
<h3 id="kafka-lag-exporter"><a id="kafka-lag-exporter"></a>Kafka Lag Exporter</h3>
<p>Kafka Lag Exporter had native Kubernetes support and contained time-based lag monitoring out of the box. At the time, it was in beta and it didn’t fit our predefined guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="remora"><a id="remora"></a>Remora</h3>
<p>Remora was created after Zalando spent some time using Burrow. It has Datadog and CloudWatch integration, and it’s a wrap around the Kafka consumer group command—which we already had.</p>
<h3 id="burrow"><a id="burrow"></a>Burrow</h3>
<p>Burrow is an active LinkedIn project with more than 2,700 stars on GitHub. It has an active community, Gitter channel, great wiki page, and multiple extension projects. Burrow is battle tested and works in production at LinkedIn.</p>
<p>We chose Burrow because it answered all our needs, including tailor-made metrics calculations, providing enough flexibility to expose the metrics at different levels, and calculating lag time. At the current time, we are also considering Confluent Platform, because it provides many components that we would otherwise need to build and implement on our own. Confluent Platform also includes Confluent Control Center, which is another monitoring tool for Apache Kafka.</p>
<p>So, what is Burrow?</p>
<h2 id="burrow"><a id="burrow"></a>Burrow</h2>
<p>Burrow is a monitoring solution for Kafka that provides consumer lag checking as a service. It monitors committed offsets for all consumers and calculates the status of those consumers on demand. The metrics are exposed via an HTTP endpoint.</p>
<p>Burrow also has configurable notifiers that can send status updates via email or HTTP if a partition status has changed based on <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/Burrow/wiki/Consumer-Lag-Evaluation-Rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predefined lag evaluation rules</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-offset-commit-11.png" alt="Kafka Cluster | Offset Commit | Zookeeper" width="936" height="594" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-offset-commit-11.png 936w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-offset-commit-11-300x190.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-offset-commit-11-768x487.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-offset-commit-11-350x222.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/kafka-cluster-offset-commit-11-600x381.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px"></p>
<p>Burrow has a modular design and consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clusters/Consumers subsystem</strong> runs a Kafka client (<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/sarama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarama</a>) that periodically updates cluster …</li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Findka now includes an RSS aggregator.</p><p><img src="https://findka.com/img/subscriptions-example.png" alt="Example of subscribing to RSS feeds on Findka"></p><p>If you subscribe to any feeds, then 50% of the articles in your regular Findka
emails will be sampled from those feeds.
I added this because, <a href="https://findka.com/blog/2020-12-05/">as I mentioned</a>,
I'm going to start doing more manual curation to make sure that Findka has a
steady stream of new, great essays. I also think it's a valuable feature for
anyone who wants a little more control over their Findka recommendations.</p><p>How's this different from existing RSS aggregators? For one thing, since this
is built into Findka, any articles that you like will start to be recommended
to other users, too. But there's more.</p><p>Most RSS aggregators keep your feeds separate. Findka instead merges them into
a single feed using a bandit algorithm. If you've subscribed to three
feeds—A, B and C—Findka will start out picking articles from the
feeds uniformly. 1/3 of the articles will come from feed A, etc. As time goes
on, Findka will adjust the distribution based on your usage data. If you never
click on articles from feed A and you always click on articles from feed B,
then Findka will show you fewer articles from A and more articles from B.</p><p>On top of that, the number of articles in your feed is controlled by you, not
by the feeds you subscribe to.</p><p><img src="https://findka.com/img/frequency-setting.png" alt="Example of subscribing to RSS feeds on Findka"></p><p>The result is that using RSS now takes extremely little effort. You get a
single, small feed that improves itself automatically.</p><p>I'm planning to add more RSS-related features—stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]>

We’ve created </em><a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank"><em>a starter repository</em></a><em> to show these concepts in PostgreSQL and MySQL </em><a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank"><em>on Github</em></a><em> if you’d like to dig in immediately while reviewing our process below.</em></p><p>Containers are a valuable resource for us developers. They give you the ability to package your production code, dependencies, and assets into a standardized unit. Once conveniently packaged, running your application in a variety of environments is a breeze. And yet despite containerization’s immense value, we often see teams overlook containers entirely when it comes to managing test databases. At Tonic, whether we’re helping our customers improve testing with high-quality test databases or building our own testing environments, we rely on Docker as a key part of the pipeline. Our customers are finding a lot of value in the approach, so we thought we’d share our strategy.</p><h2>The Trouble With Test Databases</h2><p>Let’s take a look at the typical growth of a test database for a team:</p><ol role="list"><li>You and your team realize that testing in production is a bad idea. You’ve heard about it or you’ve felt the pain yourself: mistakes that lead to data loss and time spent restoring from backups; poor reliability in production due to increased database load; the security team raising their eyebrows at giving too many people access to sensitive data; and the omnipresent anxiety that testing might take down production.</li><li>You decide you need data that’s similar to your production environment, so you write some scripts to generate some fake data (like<a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/how-to-generate-simple-test-data-with-faker" target="_blank"> faker</a>), use some free or paid services to generate some random data for you (like<a href="https://www.tonic.ai/post/tonic-mockaroo" target="_blank"> Mockaroo</a>), or extract data from production and attempt to anonymize it later (dealing with the mess of maintaining referential integrity).</li><li>You shove either those scripts or data files into your code repo.</li><li>You write in a README the loader command to get it into your database of choice, and like a rite of passage, everyone on the team struggles through getting it to work during onboarding.</li></ol><p>And struggle you will! Databases are notorious for requiring large installations with a multitude of dependencies, navigating arcane configuration, and the extensive work of establishing the test dataset: creating schemas, creating tables, and finally loading your generated data.</p><p>Many teams will have a separate installation process for each operating system their developers use, each of which usually takes a good bit of trial and error after poring over database documentation. Others will set up a staging or test server for their team to use, but it risks becoming out-dated without a regular rebuild, it means a lot of coordination between team members, and there is rarely a one-size-fits-all test environment. For example, when you want to test the scale of your application, your entire team is saddled with a giant database that slows everyone down; likewise, too small of a database can limit effective testing for certain projects.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great if there were a tool that made it easy to package a database, its dependencies, loader scripts, and its data for any operating system? That any team member could use to easily test their code against a test environment, be it on their local machine or on a quickly spun-up test server in the cloud?</p><h2>Doing Better with Docker</h2><p>Good news, everyone! There is a better way! The many benefits that Docker provides for shipping your code in production work likewise for testing. You can create a database that is easy to distribute, deploy, and reset so that individuals and teams can work effectively without stepping on each other’s toes. For larger organizations, you can even package multiple test databases that each contain different tables or amounts of data, easily available to everyone in your engineering org. Best of all, you don’t need a different local installation README for each operating system—developers can just use the OS they feel most productive in without the headaches of the past.</p><h3>The Basics</h3><p>The simplest way to get started is to use a vanilla database image for your database of choice. By using docker-compose, you can set up the configuration once, and it’s just a<tt> docker-compose up -d </tt>to start the database. Here’s a basic configuration below:</p><h5>version: '3'<br>services:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testdb_postgres:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image: postgres:12<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restart: always<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ports:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 5432:5432<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_USER: user<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSTGRES_DB: test_data<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;container_name: testdb_postgres<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volumes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- /tmp:/tmp<br></h5><p>This configuration does the following:</p><div><ul role="“list”">
<li>Creates a container named<tt> testdb_postgres </tt>that runs off of a PostgreSQL 12 image</li>
<li>Opens up Postgres’ default port of 5432 to 5432 on your host machine</li>
<li>Attaches the<tt> /tmp </tt>folder to your host machine’s<tt> /tmp </tt>folder</li>
<li>Creates a new user with credentials<tt> user/password</tt>, and a new database called<tt> testdb_postgres</tt>.</li></ul></div><p>Right off the bat, we’ve removed a lot of work from the README, and if you have data or data-generating scripts in your repo, you’ve made it much easier to get up and running quickly by simply pointing them to load into the database via the host part. Many databases have official images, including <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/" target="_blank">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server" target="_blank">MS SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/oraclelinux" target="_blank">Oracle</a>, and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo" target="_blank">Mongo</a>, among others.</p><h3>Even Better: Packaging Your Data &amp; Scripts with Docker</h3><p>Instead of just using the available database image and calling it a day, you can easily create a new Docker image based off of your database’s official image. Many official images have an entry point folder that allows you to run scripts upon initialization, enabling the container to be immediately useful as soon as it’s up. To do this, you’ll likely need to add a Dockerfile and a build script, and potentially any data import scripts.</p><h4>Dockerfile</h4><p>Making a basic Dockerfile is not hard at all, in fact it’s only two lines:</p><h5>FROM postgres:12<br>COPY sql/*.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/</h5><p>Here we did the following:<br></p><div><ol role="list">
<li>We started by defining a<tt> Dockerfile </tt>with a<tt> FROM </tt>declaration pointing to the base image of your database.</li>
<li>We copied over all of our data import scripts (defined in a subdirectory named sql) to the<tt> /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ </tt>directory. Postgres <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">defines this folder</a> for SQL scripts to be run during initialization.</li>
</ol></div><p>In our <a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank">code repository</a>, you’ll see we’ve commented out additional options to consider for your use case, such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>Adding any additional dependencies, like database extensions or certificates using typical package manager commands.</li><li>Adding data files to an accessible directory for use with data import scripts.</li><li>Adding custom scripts to import data outside of the container, e.g. via S3 or other data storage.</li></ul><h4>Build Script</h4><p>Here we simply create a shell script to make it easier to build the container. Our build.sh contains the following command which merely tags the new container as<tt> testdb_postgres </tt>and specifies the Dockerfile to use.</p><h5>docker build -f Dockerfile -t testdb_postgres .<br></h5><p>If you were building this in a CI environment, we’d recommend giving the tag a unique version for each build and release as a script argument, such as<tt> testdb_postgres:1.0.4</tt>.</p><h4>SQL Scripts</h4><p>Next, you’ll need to create SQL loader scripts that create your schema and load in your data. Typically the easiest way to do this is by using database dump commands with an existing test database. We recommend three scripts: the first one creates your schema without constraints, the second one loads your data, and the third one adds your constraints to all of your tables. This way, you’re able to load your data without worrying about the order in which it’s loaded (which would matter if foreign key constraints were already in place).</p><p>Some databases will turn off constraints using a data import tool until the import is complete, which means you can just keep your constraints in the schema script. For simplicity, in <a href="https://github.com/TonicAI/docker-testdb" target="_blank">our example code</a> we only use two scripts since our data script loads tables in order and doesn’t break referential integrity.</p><p>Sticking with PostgreSQL as our example, you can run the following command to get a dump of your existing schema and constraints:</p><h5>pg_dump -U user -s -f 1_schema.sql [YOUR DATABASE NAME];</h5><p>Followed by a similar command to get just the data:<br></p><h5>pg_dump -U user -a -f 2_data.sql test_data;<br></h5><p>Notably, we’ve added numbers to the beginning of each filename to ensure that the schema script is run before the data load script. (Postgres runs the scripts in this folder in alphabetical order.)</p><p>Take a look at our code to see the full output of both of these files. Feel free to modify these files as you like or write them from scratch, especially if you plan to load your data using a COPY or LOAD command.</p><h4>Modifying your docker-compose.yml</h4><p>Lastly, update the image you’re using to the name of your newly tagged one: image: testdb_postgres. If you’re versioning your container when you build it, we recommend specifying a stable release tag such as<tt> testdb_postgres:stable </tt>so that users can pull the latest update to that tag with<tt> docker-compose pull</tt>.</p><h4>Setting up CI</h4><p>Now you can check your Dockerfile, scripts, and data files into a code repo, and create a build for the Docker container in your CI service of choice using your build script. Any time the scripts or data files are changed, we recommend triggering a new release build for the container and pushing it to your container repository for use by your entire team (of course, after you’ve checked that nothing new caused the build to break 😉).</p><p>If everything is set up, it should be as simple as distributing the docker-compose.yml file to your team and running a<tt> docker-compose up</tt>.</p><h2>Next Level Test Data Management</h2><p>If you’ve followed the steps thus far, you’ll likely find that your testing setup is much more reliable and useful to your entire team, and it’s a big leap forward in efficiency.</p><p>From here, there are a lot of ways …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>One of my favorite things about functional programming is the ability to work and think in a very localized area of code. Let's talk about some of the patterns that make that possible.</p>
<p>I won't go into how immutability, managed effects, or lack of global variables help us reason locally - although they really do! What I want to focus on here is the power of individual transformations composed together, rather than making one big transformation. This concept is sometimes called a Combinator.</p>
<h2>Top-Down Vs. Bottom-Up Transformations</h2>
<p>In my JavaScript days, I remember a particularly tricky area of code where we had a big list of data in a format defined by the server. We needed to take product listings, pull out specific options and inventory information, normalize them, and then apply filters from the UI to show/hide and sort search results.</p>
<p>There were deeply nested fields, and some incongruities in the shape of the data. Some values were nullable. Some had specific normalization we needed to apply to get data from multiple sources to match.</p>
<p>We had a lot of big unit tests to make sure things were working. Even so, it was so difficult to go in to our series of lodash function calls and find <em>where</em> you needed to make a change. And once you did, you would want to make sure you added several new test cases to make sure you didn't miss a spot or mishandle a special case.</p>
<p>We would sit in awe as the person most familiar with the codebase correctly traversed the nested arrays and objects to get to the exact right place and make a change on the first try. It was a lot to hold in our heads, and it was quite error prone.</p>
<p>The challenge was that using that paradigm to normalize JSON data required thinking of the data as a monolith. We certainly abstracted out functions to help with parts of the normalization. And we used lodash to do functional style mapping over the arrays of data and key-value objects. But mapping over arrays and objects only gets you part of the way there. We still needed to keep a map in our heads of the structure of the data so we could go into a specific area, traverse it, and change it.</p>
<p>We weren't using TypeScript at the time, but even if we had been, the challenge would remain of having to navigate the structure from the top down in order to add a new transformation. Type-safety is a huge help, but it only gets you part of the way there to the benefits of localized reasoning.</p>
<h2>What is a Combinator?</h2>
<p>The term Combinator is used because you can <em>combine</em> the smaller units to build up the whole. A Combinator is the idea of building something up by combining small "base" values into more complex ones. The values could be a JSON Decoder, a syntax parser, a random number generator. The key is that the simplest form can be composed together to build something complex - but (this is important) the simple thing and the complex thing are the same kind of thing!</p>
<p>Combinators share some parallels with the concept of recursion (defining a function in terms of itself).</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>fibonacci</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>n</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>fibonacci</span> <span>(</span> <span>n</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span> <span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>fibonacci</span> <span>(</span> <span>n</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This recursive definition can be read as <em>what</em> a fibonacci number is (declarative), instead of <em>how</em> it is calculated (imperative). No mention of <em>how</em> to loop over in each iteration - it's simply written in terms of itself, like a math equation. It's pretty close to how you would teach fibonacci to a human. It just so happens that computers can understand it, too!</p>
<p>Recursion is a good analogy for Combinators:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Combinator is declarative (not imperative)</li>
<li>A Combinator is either defined in terms of other Combinators (analogous to a recursive self-invocation), or it is a "base" combinator (analogous to a recursive base case)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at an example of a Combinator in Elm. The <code>elm/json</code> package is how you turn untyped JSON data into typed Elm data (or an <code>Err</code> <code>Result</code> value if the structure doesn't match).</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>personDecoder</span> <span>:</span>
    <span>Decoder</span>
        <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>birthday</span> <span>:</span> <span>Time.Posix</span>
        <span>}</span>
<span>personDecoder</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Decode.map2</span>
        <span>(</span>\<span>name</span> <span>birthday</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
            <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>birthday</span> <span>=</span> <span>birthday</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>nameDecoder</span>
        <span>birthdayDecoder</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What are <code>nameDecoder</code> and <code>birthdayDecoder</code>? They're both some kind of <code>Decoder</code>. We're <em>combining</em> them. Note that we can think about the Decoders here at a high-level, and drop into the details as needed.</p>
<p>At some point, following our <code>Decoder</code> definitions we will find a <code>Decoder</code> that doesn't just compose Decoders, but directly resolves to a value (similar to our recursive <strong>base case</strong>).</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>nameDecoder</span> <span>:</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>String</span>
<span>nameDecoder</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Decode.string</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Decode.field</span> <span>"full-name"</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>Decode.string</code> is going to resolve to some value. But we can compose Decoders together in more ways than just combining them or reading JSON values within a JSON property (like <code>"full-name"</code>).</p>
<p>Another key technique for a Combinator is that we can transform them.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>birthdayDecoder</span> <span>:</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>Time.Posix</span>
<span>birthdayDecoder</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>Decode.field</span> <span>"birthday-date-time"</span> <span>iso8601DateDecoder</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we follow the definitions, we finally end up with a direct "base" Decoder for <code>birthdayDecoder</code>.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>iso8601DateDecoder</span> <span>:</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>Time.Posix</span>
<span>iso8601DateDecoder</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Decode.string</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Decode.andThen</span>
            <span>(</span>\<span>dateTimeString</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
                <span>case</span> <span>iso8601StringToTime</span> <span>dateTimeString</span> <span>of</span>
                    <span>Ok</span> <span>time</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
                        <span>Decode.succeed</span> <span>time</span>

                    <span>Err</span> <span>error</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
                        <span>Decode.fail</span> <span>error</span>
            <span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This time, we are transforming the raw String into an Elm <code>Time.Posix</code> value. <code>iso8601StringToTime</code> is a function that takes a <code>String</code> and gives a <code>Result String Time.Posix</code>. When we transform the "base" <code>Decoder</code> (<code>Decode.string</code>), the type changes with it.</p>
<p>These are some of the basic building blocks of a Combinator. Let's explore how these building blocks lend themselves to breaking down a problem into smaller pieces, without needing to pull in all the surrounding context.</p>
<h2>Combinators are trees</h2>
<p>With the JS code where I was working with JSON from the server, I was working on the data top-down, and carving out new "seams" to transform data as needed. In contrast, with a Combinator you already have a place to work. You can visualize a Combinator as a tree. You build up a complex Combinator from the bottom up, and you can think locally about any sub-problem (think sub-tree). Each sub-problem is like a little box that you can work in. Once you find the right box, you don't need to worry about what's outside of that box, you can just focus on what's inside the box you're working on. You don't need to create a new point to make your transformation, because it already exists.</p>
<p>For example, if we need to normalize the names we're getting from the server, we just find the right box and work within that.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>nameDecoder</span> <span>:</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>String</span>
<span>nameDecoder</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Decode.string</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Decode.map</span> <span>normalizeName</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Decode.field</span> <span>"full-name"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or if the name may have a different format, we just make that change within our box, blissfully unaware of the JSON structure surrounding our box.</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>nameDecoder</span> <span>:</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>String</span>
<span>nameDecoder</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Decode.oneOf</span> <span>[</span> <span>Decode.string</span><span>,</span> <span>firstLastDecoder</span> <span>]</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Decode.map</span> <span>normalizeName</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Decode.field</span> <span>"full-name"</span>

<span>firstLastDecoder</span> <span>:</span> <span>Decoder</span> <span>String</span>
<span>firstLastDecoder</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Decode.map2</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>Decode.field</span> <span>"first"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>Decode.field</span> <span>"last"</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Joël Quenneville has a nice visualization of this concept in his article <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/elms-universal-pattern">Elm's Universal Pattern</a>.</p>
<h2>Intermediary Data</h2>
<p>Another quality of transforming data in an imperative style is that it can happen in multiple passes. Each iteration to transform the data can yield an intermediary data format that isn't useful except as input to the next transformation phase.</p>
<p>By using a Combinator, you can avoid passing data through various transformation stages. A Combinator represents a set of operations/transformations. You don't actually <em>use</em> the Combinator until you've built it up. If you need to tweak something, you transform the Combinator. So the data is never exposed in your app in an intermediary format.</p>
<p>We are building up both the JSON Decoder and its type information at the same time. Since the types and operations/transformations are in sync, we are guaranteed to either</p>
<ol>
<li>End up with well-typed data (happy path), or</li>
<li>End up with a clear error</li>
</ol>
<p>I really love this quality of the Combinator pattern. This gives you explicit, clearly defined paths, with types fully describing the possibilites. Take a look at Alexis King's article <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/">Parse, Don't Validate</a> for some great insights about that.</p>
<h2>Combinators Beyond JSON Decoders</h2>
<p>This pattern isn't specific to a language, like Elm, or a domain, like JSON.</p>
<p>You can use these same concepts in TypeScript with a library like <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts"><code>io-ts</code></a>. And you can apply this thinking to a lot more problems than JSON. Some examples in the Elm ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/"><code>elm/random</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/"><code>elm/parser</code></a></li>
<li>Creating fuzzers (property-based test data) in <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/latest/"><code>elm/test</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql"><code>elm-graphql</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rtfeldman/elm-validate/latest/"><code>elm-validate</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Next Post</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading! In the next post, I will share lessons learned about this technique and how it made me realize why I loved one type-safe library I built, and am now rebuilding another to learn these lessons a few years later.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p> This post is a sample of my book <b>Essential Math for Data Science</b>!</p><p>Learn the math needed for data science and machine learning using a <span>practical approach with Python</span>.</p></div><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/cover_free_sample.jpg" width="200px"></p></div><p>Machines only understand numbers. For instance, if you want to create a spam detector, you have first to convert your text data into numbers (for instance, through <em>word embeddings</em>). Data can then be stored in vectors, matrices, and tensors. For instance, images are represented as matrices of values between 0 and 255 representing the luminosity of each color for each pixel. It is possible to leverage the tools and concepts from the field of linear algebra to manipulate these vectors, matrices and tensors.</p><p>Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies <em>vector spaces</em>. You’ll see how vectors constitute vector spaces and how linear algebra applies linear transformations to these spaces. You’ll also learn the powerful relationship between sets of linear equations and vector equations, related to important data science concepts like <em>least squares approximation</em>. You’ll finally learn important matrix decomposition methods: <em>eigendecomposition</em> and <em>Singular Value Decomposition</em> (SVD), important to understand unsupervised learning methods like <em>Principal Component Analysis</em> (PCA).</p><h2 id="what-are-vectors">What are Vectors?</h2><p>Linear algebra deals with <em>vectors</em>. Other mathematical entities in the field can be defined by their relationship to vectors: <em>scalars</em>, for example, are single numbers that <em>scale</em> vectors (stretching or contracting) when they are multiplied by them.</p><p>However, vectors refer to various concepts according to the field they are used in. In the context of data science, they are a way to store values from your data. For instance, take the height and weight of people: since they are distinct values with different meanings, you need to store them separately, for instance using two vectors. You can then do operations on vectors to manipulate these features without loosing the fact that the values correspond to different attributes.</p><p>You can also use vectors to store data samples, for instance, store the height of ten people as a vector containing ten values.</p><h5 id="notation">Notation</h5><p>We’ll use lowercase, boldface letters to name vectors (such as $\vv$). As usual, refer to the Appendix in <a href="https://bit.ly/3gB7p5Z">Essential Math for Data Science</a> to have the summary of the notations used in this book.</p><h3 id="sec:ch02_section_coordinates_and_vectors">Geometric and Coordinate Vectors</h3><p>The word <em>vector</em> can refer to multiple concepts. Let’s learn more about geometric and coordinate vectors.</p><p><em>Coordinates</em> are values describing a position. For instance, any position on earth can be specified by geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevation).</p><h4 id="geometric-vectors">Geometric Vectors</h4><p><em>Geometric vectors</em>, also called <em>Euclidean vectors</em>, are mathematical objects defined by their magnitude (the length) and their direction. These properties allow you to describe the displacement from a location to another.</p><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/ch06_scalars_and_vectors/ch06_geometric_vector.png" alt="Figure 1: A geometric vector running from $A$ to $B$." width="400px"> <em>Figure 1: A geometric vector running from $A$ to $B$.</em></p><p>For instance, Figure 1 shows that the point $A$ has coordinates (1, 1) and the point $B$ has coordinates (3, 2). The geometric vectors $\vv$ describes the displacement from $A$ to $B$, but since vectors are defined by their magnitude and direction, you can also represent $\vv$ as starting from the origin.</p><div> <p><b>Cartesian Plane</b></p><p> In Figure 1, we used a coordinate system called the <i>Cartesian plane</i>. The horizontal and vertical lines are the <i>coordinate axes</i>, usually labeled respectively $x$ and $y$. The intersection of the two coordinates is called the <i>origin</i> and corresponds to the coordinate 0 for each axis.</p><p> In a Cartesian plane, any position can be specified by the $x$ and the $y$ coordinates. The Cartesian coordinate system can be extended to more dimensions: the position of a point in a $n$-dimensional space is specified by $n$ coordinates. The real coordinate $n$-dimensional space, containing $n$-tuples of real numbers, is named $\setR^n$. For instance, the space $\setR^2$ is the two-dimensional space containing pairs of real numbers (the coordinates). In three dimensions ($\setR^3$), a point in space is represented by three real numbers.</p></div><h4 id="coordinate-vectors">Coordinate Vectors</h4><p><em>Coordinate vectors</em> are ordered lists of numbers corresponding to the vector coordinates. Since vector initial points are at the origin, you need to encode only the coordinates of the terminal point.</p><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/ch06_scalars_and_vectors/ch06_coordinate_vector.png" alt="Figure 2: The vector $\vv$ has coordinates (3, 2) corresponding to three units from the origin on the $x$-axis and two on the $y$-axis." width="350px"> <em>Figure 2: The vector $\vv$ has coordinates (3, 2) corresponding to three units from the origin on the $x$-axis and two on the $y$-axis.</em></p><p>For instance, let’s take the vector $\vv$ represented in Figure 2. The corresponding coordinate vector is as follows: \[\vv = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\]</p><p>Each value is associated with a direction: in this case, the first value corresponds to the the $x$-axis direction and the second number to the $y$-axis.</p><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/ch06_scalars_and_vectors/ch06_vector_component.png" alt="Figure 3: Components of a coordinate vector." width="250px"> <em>Figure 3: Components of a coordinate vector.</em></p><p>As illustrated in Figure 3, these values are called <em>components</em> or <em>entries</em> of the vector.</p><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/ch06_scalars_and_vectors/ch06_vectors_as_points.png" alt="Figure 4: Vectors can be represented as points in the Cartesian plane." width="300px"> <em>Figure 4: Vectors can be represented as points in the Cartesian plane.</em></p><p>In addition, as represented in Figure 4, you can simply represent the terminal point of the arrow: this is a scatter-plot.</p><h5 id="sec:ch06_section_indexing">Indexing</h5><p><em>Indexing</em> refers to the process of getting a vector component (one of the values from the vector) using its position (its index).</p><p>Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning that the first index is zero. However mathematically, the convention is to use one-based indexing. I’ll denote the component $i$ of the vector $\vv$ with a subscript, as $v_i$, without bold font because the component of the vector is a scalar.</p><h5 id="numpy">Numpy</h5><p>In Numpy, vectors are called <em>one-dimensional arrays</em>. You can use the function <code>np.array()</code> to create one:</p><h5 id="more-components">More Components</h5><p>Let’s take the example of $\vv$, a three-dimensional vectors defined as follows: \[\vv = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \end{bmatrix}\]</p><p>As shown in in Figure 5, you can reach the endpoint of the vector by traveling 3 units in the $x$-axis, 4 in the $y$-axis, and 2 in the $z$-axis.</p><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/ch06_scalars_and_vectors/ch06_vector_3d.png" alt="Figure 5: Three-dimensional representation of the origin at (0, 0, 0) and the point at (3, 4, 2)." width="400px"> <em>Figure 5: Three-dimensional representation of the origin at (0, 0, 0) and the point at (3, 4, 2).</em></p><p>More generally, in a $n$-dimensional space, the position of a terminal point is described by $n$ components.</p><h4 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h4><p>You can denote the dimensionality of a vector using the <em>set</em> notation $\setR^n$. It expresses the <em>real coordinate space</em>: this is the $n$-dimensional space with real numbers as coordinate values.</p><p>For instance, vectors in $\setR^3$ have three components, as the following vector $\vv$ for example: \[\vv = \begin{bmatrix} 2.0 \\\\ 1.1 \\\\ -2.5 \end{bmatrix}\]</p><h4 id="vectors-in-data-science">Vectors in Data Science</h4><p>In the context of data science, you can use coordinate vectors to represent your data.</p><p>You can represent data samples as vectors with each component corresponding to a feature. For instance, in a real estate dataset, you could have a vector corresponding to an apartment with its features as different components (like the number of rooms, the location etc.).</p><p>Another way to do it is to create one vector per feature, each containing all observations.</p><p>Storing data in vectors allows you to leverage linear algebra tools. Note that, even if you can’t visualize vectors with a large number of components, you can still apply the same operations on them. This means that you can get insights about linear algebra using two or three dimensions, and then, use what you learn with a larger number of dimensions.</p><p>...</p><h2 id="the-dot-product">The Dot Product</h2><p>The <em>dot product</em> (referring to the dot symbol used to characterize this operation), also called <em>scalar product</em>, is an operation done on vectors. It takes two vectors, but unlike addition and scalar multiplication, it returns a single number (a scalar, hence the name). It is an example of a more general operation called the <em>inner product</em>.</p><p><img src="https://hadrienj.github.io/assets/images/ch06_scalars_and_vectors/ch06_dot_product_vectors.png" alt="Figure 6: Illustration of the dot product." width="350px"> <em>Figure 6: Illustration of the dot product.</em></p><p>Figure 6 shows an illustration of how the dot product works. You can see that it corresponds to the sum of the multiplication of the components with same index.</p><h3 id="definition">Definition</h3><p>The dot product between two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$, denoted by the symbol $\cdot$, is defined as the sum of the product of each pair of components. More formally, it is expressed as: \[\vu \cdot \vv = \sum_{i=1}^m \evu_i\evv_i\]</p><p>with $m$ the number of components of the vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ (they must have the same number of components), and $i$ the index of the current vector component.</p><div> <p><b>Dot Symbol</b></p><p> Note that the symbol of the dot product is the same as the dot used to refer to multiplication between scalars. The context (if the elements are scalars or vectors) tells you which one it is.</p></div><p>Let’s take an example. You have the following vectors: \[\vu = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 7 \end{bmatrix}\]</p><p>and \[\vv = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \end{bmatrix}\]</p><p>The dot product of these two vectors is defined as: \[\vu \cdot \vv = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \end{bmatrix} = 2 \times 5 + 4 \times 1 + 7 \times 3 = 35\]</p><p>The dot product between $\vu$ and $\vv$ is 35. It converts the two vectors $\vu$ and $\vv$ into a scalar.</p><p>Let’s use Numpy to calculate the dot product of these vectors. You can use the method <code>dot()</code> of Numpy arrays:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>u</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>array</span><span>([</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>7</span><span>])</span>
<span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>array</span><span>([</span><span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>])</span>
<span>u</span><span>.</span><span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>It is also possible to use the following equivalent syntax:</p><p>Or, with Python 3.5+, it is also possible to use the <code>@</code> operator:</p><div> <p><b>Vector Multiplication</b></p><p> Note that the dot product is different from the <i>element-wise</i> multiplication, also called the <i>Hadamard product</i>, which returns another vector. The symbol $\odot$ is generally used to characterize this operation. For instance: $$ \vu \odot \vv = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 7 \end{bmatrix} \odot \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \cdot 5 \\\\ 4 \cdot 1 \\\\ 7 \cdot 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 10 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 21 \end{bmatrix} $$</p></div><h4 id="dot-product-and-vector-length">Dot Product and Vector Length</h4><p>The squared $L^2$ norm can be calculated using the dot product of the vector with itself ($\vu \cdot \vu$): \[\norm{\vu}_2^2 = \vu \cdot \vu\]</p><p>This is an important property in machine learning, as you saw in <a href="https://bit.ly/3gB7p5Z">Essential Math for Data Science</a>.</p><h4 id="sec:ch04_section_special_case">Specia…</h4></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1f1419c1090747ecde7c9e/5fc975f0e81f0d75e02bb2ea_trevor-mckinnon-_fJD6NyUR8I-unsplash.jpg" alt=""></p><div><h3>The Handicap Principle: Why People Intentionally Make Bad Decisions</h3><p>Aman Manazir</p></div></div><div><div><p>In 1975, Israeli evolutionary biologist Dr. Amotz Zahavi published a paper called "Mate Selection - A Selection for Handicap." In this paper, Zahavi proposed <strong>The Handicap Principle</strong>, an explanation for the tendency of specific animals to choose mates with seemingly useless or harmful characteristics.</p><h4>The Handicap Principle</h4><p>The handicap principle centers around the idea that for a signal to be honest, it must be costly; otherwise, anyone could imitate it. </p><p>This is most clearly shown with extreme rites of passage in other cultures. For example, a tribe in the Amazon has a ritual where they sedate and interleave giant topical bullet ants into a glove. Then, a person puts their hand into the glove, and must withstand the pain without screaming. The sting of the bullet ant is considered the most painful feeling in the world. Because this is so difficult and costly, it’s extremely reliable when revealing the toughest people. </p><p>If this test instead only required five pushups, everyone could do it. No one would be able to distinguish between the contenders.</p><figure id="w-node-46a5ad47f38e-760e2c28"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGIZ-zUvotM"></iframe></p></figure><h4>Natural Selection</h4><p>‍<br>The Handicap Principle also exists within several animals in the wild.</p><p>The classic example is the size of a peacock's tail. Practically, a large tail serves no real purpose to the survival of the peacock. It's difficult to grow and carry around, and slows down the peacock when trying to evade predators. It also makes the peacock a much more noticeable target.</p><p>However, female peacocks tend to select males with larger and brighter tails. Logically, this doesn't make any sense. Why would a negative trait be considered desirable?</p><p>Zahavi's handicap principle explains this phenomenon. The size of a peacock's tail is a costly signal. Therefore, to maintain that trait through several generations, those males must be fit enough to escape predators while also finding food.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1f1419c1090747ecde7c9e/5fc97762df7bb3a15ba23adc_peacock.png" loading="lazy" alt="beautiful peacock"></p><figcaption>The peacock's tail is heavy and difficult to care for.</figcaption></figure><h5>Jumping Gazelles</h5><p>‍<br>Another example of this is a certain behavior of gazelles in the wild. When a predator approaches a herd of gazelles, occasionally a few of them will separate out and start to jump up in the air. This action is called <em>stotting</em>, and it directly handicaps the gazelle by revealing them to the predator.</p><p>Why would they make themselves visible instead of hiding within the herd? This is a form of Zahavian Signaling. They are showing the predator that they're extremely fit, and that it would be futile to chase them down.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1f1419c1090747ecde7c9e/5fc977856ffe100e058ed25e_gazelle.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="stotting gazelle"></p><figcaption>A young gazelle stotting.</figcaption></figure><h4>Luxury Purchases</h4><p>People often unconsciously participate in Zahavian Signaling without even realizing it. The best example of this is <em>conspicuous consumption</em>. This is the act of spending money on luxury goods and services solely to display wealth and status.</p><p>People purchase expensive brands (that aren't higher quality) to show that they have the ability to get away with wasting money. In other words, they purposefully financially handicap themselves to signal their wealth.<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1f1419c1090747ecde7c9e/5fc97796f847f2198145d714_supreme.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Supreme White t shirt"></p><figcaption>This white t-shirt currently costs over $1000.</figcaption></figure><h4>Struggle-Signaling is Dangerous</h4><p>A more pernicious example of this is when people unconsciously struggle signal.</p><p>When I was in high school, I'd often hear people constantly complain about making bad life choices. They would pull multiple all-nighters, or stay up past midnight on social media.</p><p>What was more concerning, however, was that groups of people would have complaining contests. One person would claim that they have an essay due in a few hours that they haven't started yet; someone else would reply by saying that they didn't study for a test they had next period.</p><p>These were all self-inflicted, terrible decisions. Instead of trying to learn from past mistakes, people would flaunt them at each other, acting like they were somehow beneficial.</p><p>This is another example of the Handicap Principle. People subconsciously harm themselves, and brag about it to show that they can make bad choices and "get away with it." </p><p>There were times where I've caught myself doing this as well. If you were in my drivers-ed class in high school, you'd know what I'm talking about. It was a running joke that I was terrible at driving, and I saw that as a good thing.</p><p>Bad decisions are never something to be proud of. It's important to recognize when you are subconsciously struggle-signaling so you can more easily eliminate poor choices.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><main><img src="https://malloc.fi/static/images/iphone-wwdc-2007.jpg" id="iphone-wwdc-2007" alt="Apple iPhone WWDC"><p>Most things in life come together as a mishmash of different things in the right time and the right place. This applies to technology as much as anything else. Brilliant technology arriving too early routinely fails to deliver on expectations.</p><p>One such thing is mobile applications built using web technologies. Ever since the dawn of <a href="https://janit.iki.fi/shit/OperaPlatform.pdf">Opera Platform</a> in 2006 there have been efforts to let developers leverage their HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to build mobile web applications.</p><p>So far none of these have delivered. From the iPhone to PhoneGap/Cordova hybrids to the FirefoxOS they have felt like a compromise; both in terms of developer- and user experience. More recently wrappers such as NativeScript and React Native that have shoehorned web tech to mobile in a novel way.</p><p>A lacking user experience, and the need for developers to learn peripheral technologies translate have prohibited widespread use of web technologies for mobile development. Specialised Mobile Developers are still required, even for run-off-the-mill CRUD apps that could just as well be written with contemporary web frameworks like Angular or Vue.js.</p><h2>"I accidentally a Mobile Application"</h2><img src="https://malloc.fi/static/images/uber-pwa.png" id="uber-pwa" alt="Uber Progressive Web App 2017"><p>Progressive Web Apps are regular web applications that run completely in the browser. They don't have an additional shell, but are enhanced to provide some native like features such as offline use. Install is done with a prompt upon browser visit. An unaffected development workflow and a single codebase are the big wins of PWAs. Thus retrofitting your existing app to be a PWA does not require a heavy rewrite.</p><p>PWAs have been around for some years and have recently gathered momentum. They’ve already got comprehensive support on both Android, and partial support on iOS, the duopoly that continues to rule the mobile space. This is only bound to get better as Google is pushing the technology and Apple is likely to continue gradual improvements as well. And regardless, any investment in the web is not lost.</p><p>For a benchmark, I recommend trying the Uber PWA over at <a href="https://m.uber.com/">m.uber.com</a> to see how fluent a user experience the browser can offer today from authentication to features. A complete case study is available on the Uber engineering blog: <a href="https://eng.uber.com/m-uber/">Building m.uber: Engineering a high-performance web app for the global market</a></p><h2>Reduced roaming fees to drive adoption?</h2><p>Desktop browsers can enjoy the benefits of PWAs, but the key target for them are mobile users. This is also an area where web apps in general hurt the most by being dependent on the network. Improved JavaScript bundler optimisations and optimised libraries like <a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> enable smaller footprint web apps. This with offline is great, but usage patterns also need to change for <a href="https://malloc.fi/pwa-usage-and-tracking-with-web-analytics">widespread adoption of PWAs</a>.</p><p>Mobile devices are by nature used a lot when traveling, so there are tons of travel apps for smartphones. Flaky mobile connections are staple in many areas, but the more significant hurdle for web applications are users avoid roaming. With roaming being expensive many users religiously avoid data usage abroad. Especially on first install PWA offline capabilities can't do magic, so something else will need to change.</p><p>In June 2017 the roaming fees for Europe were <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/06/economist-explains-13">reduced significantly</a>, so I expect people to more freely keep using the PWAs abroad once they get used to it. Together with caching of larger data sets as developers learn to leverage the new capabilities, users will learn to rely on the offline web more.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There are tons of areas where any web technologies simply won't cut it and native mobile development will continue to rule; Apple keeps investing in Swift, and Google recently adopted Kotlin. But with technologies such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API">Payment Request API</a>, <a href="https://fernandezpaco.github.io/video-camera/index.html">a Web Component for Camera capture</a> and <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/3d/30-amazing-examples-webgl-action-6142954">ever improving 3D capabilities</a>, the niches that web technologies can fill continues to grow each passing day.</p><p>It's almost ten years to date from the original iPhone hit the shop shelves. The provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1B2c3ZD9fk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4420">3rd party development method for the first iPhone</a> was Rich Internet Applications (RIA), but the time was not ready. In July 2008 Apple released the App Store filled with applications written in ObjectiveC. With Android joining the show some years later, it's been pretty a native mobile developers' hegemony.</p><p>I think today it's safe to say we've finally made it. The web is a good (mobile) application development platform. We've graduated from a document based web where we manipulated the DOM (the Document Object Model) by hand to declarative UI development. JavaScript UI libraries are now everywhere from the Desktop to Mobile Hybrid Apps to the Web (and consequently, Progressive Web Applications).</p><p>Like many years before, the fall will bring blood thirsty consultants knocking on your door, promising a single environment for both mobile and the web. Today it seems all the pieces of the puzzle are in place.</p><p>-- Jani Tarvainen, 2017/07/02</p></main></div></div></div>]]>

This is a seismic step," said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/337/291/Sickboy-640x360.jpg" alt=""></p><p><span>Sickboy</span><span>1:02:33</span><span>Mushrooms: The Magic Medicine</span></p></div></div></div><span>Thomas Hartle never used drugs before his Stage IV cancer diagnosis.

Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin&nbsp;to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it.&nbsp;</p>  <p>They are good for one year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as&nbsp;psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited," Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;to another person. There are no drugs containing&nbsp;psilocybin&nbsp;that have been authorized&nbsp; by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on&nbsp;psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of&nbsp;psilocybin."</p>  <h2>Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions</h2>  <p>"This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen," O'Sullivan said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia.&nbsp;</p>  <p>O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist. He said it's important for doctors who could eventually prescribe psychedelics to be well versed in their effects.&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834847.1607546851!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/dr-sean-o-sullivan.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Dr. Sean O'Sullivan is one of 16 health professionals who has been granted an exemption from Canada's drug laws to use magic mushrooms. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Sean O'Sullivan)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>"You would not expect a guide to take any journey over any terrain with&nbsp;which the guide was not familiar. When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist," O'Sullivan said.</p>  <p>"Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications."</p>  <p>Psilocybin&nbsp;allows the brain to put away the "default mode network," the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"If you look at your <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/seeking-seat-of-consciousness-in-dark-side-of-brain-1.1415607" target="_blank">default mode network</a>, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before," O'Sullivan said. "Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously."</p>  <p>That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

      </p><p>This image was taken with a traditional camera and lens, but could just as easily
      been taken with a pinhole camera, in which the lens is replaced with a small hole. Pinhole
      cameras have a couple of advantages over lenses - they have infinite depth of field, 
      and they don't suffer from chromatic aberration, which can be cured in a refractive
      system only by using a multiple element lens. Because they don't rely on refraction, 
      pinhole cameras can be used to form images from X-ray and other high energy sources, 
      which are normally difficult or impossible to focus.
      <br>
      </p><hr>
      <p>
      <img src="https://www.paulcarlisle.net/codedaperture/images/pinhole.jpg" width="211" height="211" alt="Pinhole Image">
      <img src="https://www.paulcarlisle.net/codedaperture/images/pinhole2.jpg" width="211" height="211" alt="Multiple Pinhole Image">
      The biggest problem with pinholes is that they are... pinholes. They let very little
      light through to the film or other detector. This problem can be overcome to some degree
      by making the hole larger, which unfortunately leads to a decrease in resolution. The
      smallest feature which can be resolved by a pinhole is approximately the same size as the
      pinhole itself. The larger the hole, the more blurred the image becomes. 
      Using multiple, small pinholes might seem to offer a way around this problem, but this
      gives rise to a confusing montage of overlapping images. Nonetheless, if the pattern of
      holes is carefully chosen, it is possible to reconstruct the original image with a
      resolution equal to that of a single hole.
      <br>
      </p><hr>
      <p>
      <img src="https://www.paulcarlisle.net/codedaperture/images/aperture.gif" width="211" height="211" alt="MURA Aperture">
      This pattern is a Modified Uniformly Redundant Array, or MURA. A MURA pattern can be
      used as the aperture of a pinhole camera, and consists of nearly 50% open space. In
      the case shown, the MURA is 211 elements on a side, which gives it a light gathering
      power ~22,000 times that of a single pinhole. A MURA is constructed on a square lattice
      whose side length p is prime; each element of the MURA, A<sub>
      i,j</sub>, where i and j run from 0 to p − 1, is:
      </p><ul>
         <li>0 if i = 0,
         </li><li>1 if j = 0, i != 0,
         </li><li>1 if C<sub>i</sub>C<sub>j</sub> = +1,
         </li><li>0 otherwise,
      </li></ul><p>
      where C<sub>q</sub> = +1 if q is a quadratic residue modulo p, and −1 otherwise. C<sub>
      q</sub> is also known as the Jacobi symbol. If x<sup>2</sup> mod p = q mod p, q is said
      to be a quadratic residue of p. The resulting array of 1's and 0's can be cyclically
      shifted to bring the upper left corner to the center of the array, resulting in the
      pattern shown, where white corresponds to 1 and black corresponds to 0.
      </p><p>
      <br>
      <img src="https://www.paulcarlisle.net/codedaperture/images/detected.jpg" width="211" height="211" alt="Detected Image">
      In any case, if we use this MURA as the aperture of our camera, the original gumball
      scene produces an image which most would not consider to be a great improvement over
      that produced by a single pinhole. The multiple overlapping images generate what could
      graciously be called a huge mess.
      </p><p>
      There's hope, however...
      <br>
      </p><hr>
      <p>
      <img src="https://www.paulcarlisle.net/codedaperture/images/decoder.gif" width="211" height="211" alt="Decoder Mask">
      This decoding pattern is based on the MURA above. Its elements, G<sub>i,j</sub>, are
      constructed from the MURA's elements A<sub>i,j</sub> and are equal to:
      </p><ul>
         <li>+1 if i + j = 0,
         </li><li>+1 if A<sub>i,j</sub> = 1 (i + j != 0),
         </li><li>−1 if A<sub>i,j</sub> = 0 (i + j != 0)
      </li></ul><p>
      Each 0 in the MURA is replaced by a −1 in this pattern, with the exception of the
      upper left element, which is always 1. Again, the resulting pattern has been cyclically
      shifted to bring the upper left corner into the center, which shows the symmetry of
      the array.
      </p><p>
      <br>
      <img src="https://www.paulcarlisle.net/codedaperture/images/recon.jpg" width="211" height="211" alt="Reconstructed Image">
      If we now perform the correlation of the smeared image above with the decoding pattern,
      we can reconstruct the original scene with a resolution equal to the smallest element
      of the MURA, with a tremendous gain in light gathering power.
      <br>
      A couple of interesting points remain. First, actually building a pinhole camera using
      this technique is not straightforward. Because a tremendous amount of light comes
      through the aperture, exposure times become much shorter than with a single pinhole.
      The resulting image must then be digitized and fed to a computer for post processing;
      alignment of the image becomes a problem. Still, it might be worth making a
      transparency of the aperture shown above, and projecting its image through a tube
      onto a translucent screen, where it could be photographed directly. The ultimate
      camera would let the pattern from the aperture fall onto a CCD, which would digitize
      the image directly and pass it along to a microprocessor for the requisite mathematical
      treatment.
      </p><p>
      It is not clear whether such a camera would exhibit the infinite depth of field
      associated with single pinholes. Light reflecting from different points of an object
      close to the aperture would enter the mask at different angles, which would seem to
      necessitate a more complex decoding procedure. Still, we can speculate that the
      resulting pattern would carry enough information to reconstruct the depth information
      from the scene. This is an interesting problem which needs further exploration.

      The images presented here were constructed by convolving the original image with matrix
      representations of the apertures in <cite>Mathematica</cite>. The original color image
      was split into red, green and blue channels within <cite>Photoshop</cite>, and these
      monochrome images were saved in raw format. After processing, the resulting data files
      were read back into <cite>Photoshop</cite> and recombined into a color image. <cite>
      Mathematica</cite> performs Fast Fourier Transforms to aid in the convolution
      and correlation operations, and also has a function which returns the Jacobi symbol.

      Building a real coded aperture camera is difficult. We have cheerfully assumed here
      that the detected scene ends abruptly at precisely the limit of the aperture's field
      of view. In real life, sources outside the field of view cause partial views of the
      aperture to fall on the detector or film, which adds noise and spurious images to
      the reconstructed product. Also, misalignment of the aperture and detector elements will
      cause further difficulties. Nevertheless, several such cameras have been built and
      used for X-ray and Gamma-ray observations aboard balloons and satellites.

<p>Most people thought I was crazy for doing this, but I spent the last few months of my gap year working as a short order cook at a family-owned fast-food restaurant. (More on this <a href="https://offlinemark.com/2020/11/12/gap-year-restaurant/">here</a>.) I’m a programmer by trade, so I enjoyed thinking about the restaurant’s systems from a programmer’s point of view. Here’s some thoughts about two such systems.</p>



<h2>Double, triple, and even quadruple fetching</h2>



<p>Human systems, at first glance, can appear broken, but due to subtle human factors, they might actually work just fine.</p>



<p>My best example is the system for taking and fulfilling orders. We never wrote anything down, and would re-ask orders multiples times, including when ringing customers up. (In computer security, this is known as a <a href="https://ctf-wiki.github.io/ctf-wiki/pwn/linux/kernel/double-fetch/">double fetch</a>.) Not great service and can theoretically let customers lie and pay less. </p>



<p>In practice most customers didn’t mind too much, liars are rare, and we can loosely detect when something seems off with an order.</p>



<p>Writing orders down and asking strictly once seems optimal but has subtle flaws. For one thing, there’s not enough space behind the counter for everyone to walk to the written order, so it requires more internal communication. This will fail during a rush when you’re blocked on order details and coworkers are too busy for questions. <strong>Customers are always idle; coworkers aren’t</strong>.</p>



<p>It can increase confusion if order slips aren’t thrown out when orders are finished and is also logistically (and literally) messy if you have greasy gloves and want to avoid touching a pen, then food. Lastly, many of my coworkers were older and very used to the existing system. <strong>A major transition to a new system would have generated more confusion than it’s worth</strong>.</p>



<h2>Scheduling algorithms for the fry cook</h2>



<p>While I covered a range of duties including the cash register, milkshake machine, and grill, I spent the most time on the deep fryer. I’m delighted to present this overanalysis of life as a fry cook, from a programmer’s point of view.</p>



<p>This is what deep fryers look like (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nachi.org%2Fdeep-fryer-inspection.htm&amp;psig=AOvVaw1D90dsceyn1wmU-KOGAEuy&amp;ust=1605391502547000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCNCq-sPDgO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE">source</a>):</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;ssl=1" alt="Deep Fryer" width="360" height="352" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/d12m281ylf13f0.cloudfront.net/images10-2/commercial-fryer-2.jpg?resize=360%2C352&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>This picture has 2 fryers, each with 2 baskets that can be submerged to sit in the vats of hot oil below. At work, only 1 fryer would be active on any given day which effectively allows 2 items to be fried at the same time.</p>



<p><strong>Fry cooks have a lot in common with operating systems in that they are both responsible for scheduling</strong>. Operating systems schedule threads to run on a limited number of cores; fry cooks schedule food to be fried in a limited number of fryers. Different food items have different priorities, and different lengths of time to cook.</p>



<p>French fries, curly fries, and onion rings (collectively, “fries”) are the main menu items from the deep fryer. Each fry order could be large or small (except for rings which were only large) and eat-in or to-go. The job of the fry cook is to:</p>



<ul><li>Accept fry orders from the greeter.</li><li>Allocate portions of fries from the big bags of raw fries</li><li>Cook them in the fryers</li><li>Put them into the appropriate eat-in/to-go container</li><li>Serve them onto the customer’s tray on the counter, or their to-go bag</li></ul>



<p>The goal is to do this with maximum speed and accuracy and without dropping orders. You’ll ideally minimize the number of times you ask customers and coworkers for order details. In addition, there are a few sources of complexity to handle:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Incomplete information</strong>: Depending on the greeter, they may forget to specify if it’s eat-in or to-go. You can always ask the customer, but the grill chef will likely ask the same question in a little bit. You might be able to save a customer ask if you can eavesdrop on that interaction.</li><li><strong>Timing requirements</strong>: You need to finish orders by the time the grill chef finishes the burgers/hot dogs, but you shouldn’t finish too early. If you put the fries on the counter way before the burgers are ready, they’ll get cold. This matters less for to-go orders, which you can serve into the bag immediately.</li><li><strong>Scale</strong>: During a rush, you might receive many orders per minute, while only being able to process 1-2 per minute. Once the greeter relays the order, they forget it, so it’s up to you to remember. And remember: no writing things down.</li><li><span><strong>Waste avoidance</strong>: </span>Sometimes you or another cook will make too many fries. To avoid wasting them, you can use the excess towards a future order by refreshing them with a splash later and adding them to a fresh batch.</li><li><strong>Changing orders</strong>: Customers sometimes change their order after you’ve started cooking (e.g. regular fry to curly fry). Now you have to figure out what to do with the partially cooked portion currently in the fryer.</li><li><strong><strong>Misc items</strong></strong>: In addition to fries, there other items that need to be scheduled for time in the fryer, including chicken patties, bacon, clam strips, and fish fillets. </li></ul>



<p>A few techniques to manage all this:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Batching orders together</strong>. If a large and small fry order are in the queue, you can cook them in the same basket at the same time.<ul><li>Some customers request their fries “well done”, meaning cooked extra long. This makes batching more complicated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>“Wait n Splash”</strong>: If a fry order is done cooking far before the rest of the grill items and you don’t have pressing items that need fryer time, you can raise the basket from the oil, but leave the food in it. When the grill items finish, you can quickly splash the food back in the oil to refresh it, then serve it. This will prevent it from getting cold on the counter.</li><li><strong>Inactive fryer baskets</strong>: It can be handy to have extra storage space for cooked food. If you have a “wait n splash” order waiting, but you have more orders to fry, you can use the 2 spare baskets from the inactive fryer to store the waiting order and free up the fryer slot. This is also useful when customers change their order and you need to quickly stash the half cooked portion somewhere and start the adjusted order.</li><li><strong>“The tong dip”</strong>: If both fryers are in use and the grill chef hands you bacon to be urgently cooked, you can hold the bacon in tongs and dip it into one of the submerged baskets. This lets you effectively cook more than 2 things at the same time.</li></ul>



<p>Here’s the system I ended up using. When a new order came in, I’d stop whatever I was doing and grab the appropriate container and place it in the corresponding fry bucket. This captures all 3 pieces of information about the order (fry type, size, to-go?) letting me forget it. If I strictly follow this, I can just process the containers in the buckets like a queue. However, I still need to keep a sense of order memorized because the system doesn’t capture global ordering – if I have containers in the fry, curly fry, and onion ring buckets, I can’t tell which order came in first.</p>



<p>I don’t have a solution for this. On a super busy day, this system falls apart and I drop orders. Extreme load like that has only happened a few times and in that case, I just make large batches, forget about syncing up with the grill items, and hope I don’t have too much excess at the end. Generally, the system worked nicely.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It’s fun to think about human systems, like those in a restaurant, from a programmer’s point of view. A fry cook’s job closely resembles that of an operating system scheduler, complete with optimization points and edge cases. One can try to optimize human systems as if they were computer systems, but it’s critical to understand the subtle human aspects of the system when evaluating improvements.</p>

Alchetron</figcaption></figure><h2>The Drug Connection</h2><p>Barbie attained Bolivian citizenship under his assumed name in 1957 and once again benefitted from America’s rabid anti-communist stance. The United States was worried about the rise of communism in South America, so its government was happy to finance secret deals and covert operations to support right-leaning governments in the region. The growing cocaine industry played a pivotal role, and once again, Barbie assisted the Americans in their operations.</p><p>Barbie quickly made friends with high ranking members of the Bolivian army. In 1964, General Barrientos swept to power in the country following a coup and Barbie happily assisted him. The former Nazi also tried to claim credit for the capture and execution of Che Guevara in 1967. Bolivian troops ambushed the rebel and killed him. Barbie claimed that he shared his knowledge of guerrilla warfare with the Bolivians and this helped them find their foe. He also had little respect for the fallen revolutionary. According to Barbie, Guevara was a ‘myth’ who ‘achieved absolutely nothing’ and ‘the poor man wouldn’t have survived at all if he fought in the Second World War.’</p><p>During his time in South America, Barbie was involved with the formation of a drug shipping company that generated millions of dollars. After yet another coup in Bolivia in 1970, Barbie remained in the country to assist the new regime. He was apparently paid $2,000 a month for ‘consulting services.’ In 1971, the French Government identified him as the ‘Butcher of Lyon’ and they demanded extradition. However, the Bolivians refused to comply because Barbie was a citizen of their country.</p><p>With his freedom once again guaranteed, Barbie continued to assist the CIA in its activities; he played a role in Operation Condor, which was part of the war on communism. He was also a member of the Bolivian Cocaine Coup in 1980, and he led a neofascist group called the Fiancés of Death in the same year. This group of thugs was mainly comprised of Europeans who wore uniforms with no identifying markings, although some of them wore swastika armbands.</p><p>Barbie’s nefarious activities continued well into the 1980s as he helped Bolivia supply drugs to the United States. He was a staunch anti-communist by this stage, and it is alleged that he met leading drug suppliers such as Pablo Escobar. Barbie was also close allies with notorious Bolivian drug lord Roberto Suarez Gomez.</p><figure id="attachment_7109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7109"><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" data-src="https://cdn.historycollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ukbusinessinsider-Pablo-Escobar-1024x768.jpg" src="https://cdn.historycollection.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ukbusinessinsider-Pablo-Escobar-1024x768.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7109">Drug lord Pablo Escobar. UK Business Insider</figcaption></figure><h2>Capture &amp; Punishment</h2><p>The ex-Nazi’s luck finally ran out in 1983 when Bolivia elected a democratic government. He was extradited and transported to France for trial. The charges against him&nbsp;included his activities with the Gestapo in Lyon between 1942 and 1944. The trial didn’t begin until 1987, and it was recorded on video because of its historical significance. Barbie was charged with a total of 41 crimes against humanity based on witness testimony from French Resistance members and Jewish survivors who saw him torture and murder prisoners.</p><p>Barbie gave his name as Klaus Altmann and asked to be returned to his cell because his extradition was illegal. This request was granted, but he eventually faced his accusers on May 26, 1987. He refused to respond to the testimony, and his defense tried to argue that his crimes were no worse than those committed by France during the Colonial age. The court dismissed the argument and found Barbie guilty. A life sentence was handed down on July 4, 1987.

December 10, 2020 | https://scie.nz/rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scie.nz/rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Rust looks like an increasingly important part of the future of scientific programming.
It's as fast as C++, as flexible as Python, and does packaging
better than even R. It is also very difficult to learn, and demands a lot of
cognitive investment. On balance, the ability to write clean, fast, and safe
code is worth it, but be prepared to re-learn programming.</p>
<p>In the past two years I had something akin to a geeky conversion
experience. I first saw Rust in action in a programming languages class at
Stanford and was immediately mesmerized by the possibilities. At the time part
of an unrelated project I was working on involved
interminable fights with the JVM trying to debug why
some parallelized Java code was causing OOMs due to objects that were not
garbage collected. Or, worse, trying to understand why some objects had gone
away, my code failing with the dreaded <code>NullPointerException</code>. <a href="https://willcrichton.net/">Will
Crichton</a>'s excellent examination of programming
languages offered a way out.</p>
<p>Rust, the "low-level" language we examined looked unusual in its
enunciation of one simple principle related to memory
management -- a variable having a single owner.
Ownership can be passed around, but is always vested in a single scope. At the
time the realization you could build a programming language that followed these
principles blew my mind. Garbage collection becomes meaningless in a world
where you can simply discard data when it falls out of scope. The idea of
memory "ownership" -- i.e. a kind of property right that can be alienated or temporarily
ceded to another holder -- also resonated with the social-scientific side of my
brain.</p>
<p>On top of this simple principle of memory ownership, a wonderful edifice of
increasingly sophisticated memory management primitives is built up. References (simply
borrowing a value for some amount of time), reference-counted pointers
(allowing multiple scopes to hold references to the same memory location, with
objects only being destroyed when no one holds a reference to it any longer),
atomic reference counted pointers (when reference counting needs to be done
between threads), boxes (for dynamically-sized types, the default being the
size of every value is known at compile time), mutexes and read-write locks
(ownership explicitly passed among threads) --
all fitting together in a neat crescendo when the starting point is ownership.
Other languages, most notably C++, also offer such flexibility, but Rust really
impressed me its ability to reason about memory management at compile time.
The compiler's error messages really reinforced its strength in my first
encounter with the language. Where C++ would have let you run some wonky
code that would eventually result in a segfault, Rust obstinately complained.
You could fix the code, or if you were sure you really knew what you were
doing, wrap it in an <code>unsafe { }</code> scope, essentially telling the world you did,
indeed, <em>really</em> know what you were doing.</p>
<p>This sort of paranoid compiler has its obvious advantages, but it also creates
a huge barrier to entry. In some languages, you can write 100 lines of code,
and it will run, after some minimal syntactic debugging. Progress feels
tangible in Python, where I can sometimes code a solution to a problem in a few
hours of Jupyter hacking. By comparison, Rust always sends you back to the
drawing board, demanding to know, for instance, why you thought it would be a
good idea to return a reference to an object which should have been freed
(because no one owns it anymore). Thus the sad truth. When I first took on
using Rust for a work project, I was at least 10 times slower than when using
Python for a comparable task. Yet, slowing down and doing things correctly was
nonetheless worth it. I even find that the experience has improved how I
approach project structure in other languages.</p>
<p>What justified switching to Rust was sheer exasperation with the
unmaintainability of a Python code base. This was the case with the project
that finally gave me an excuse to turn to rust. The project required the
implementation of a complex algorithm, with many memory accesses and
the potential for redundant copying of data. I undertook the rewrite
reluctantly, knowing full well how difficult getting the code to work would be.
I was not mistaken -- I emerged after 48 hours of fighting with the compiler
with a working solution, which would have probably taken 2-4 hours of work in
Python. But this solution was incredibly fast and didn't have the memory leak
that led me away from Python initially.</p>
<p>Seeing the code work sealed the deal. I had just implemented, from first principles,
a complex algorithm. Programming was fun again. It was fun because the exercise
of fighting with the Rust compiler was ultimately an exercise in thinking about
the design of the code itself. It is an intuitive realization that comes from having
spent a while coding that the design of the code evolves <em>along with</em> the
code. In that respect programming is a bit like writing in that you
don't quite know where your keystrokes will take you when you start. The Rust
compiler is akin to a great editor who entertains your indulgences and explains
you why they're bad.</p>
<p>There is real potential for science in this language, not as a replacement for
existing tools, but as a way to empower people to do things that were
previously too difficult. <a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std">Asynchronous code</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/riker-rs/riker">actor-based computing</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/http-rs/tide">easy networking</a>, all offer the building
blocks for large scientific computing applications that need to be both fast
and safe, their state distributed across multiple machines. The usage of
traits, rather than classes, makes for a sophisticated -- albeit initially
counter-intuitive -- approach to code re-use.</p>
<p>Beyond bells and whistles, working with a programming language is also about a
lot of "little things", and that is where Rust also excels. The Cargo package
and build manager offers a neat replacement for <code>pip</code>, <code>easy_install</code> and <code>conda</code>,
rolled into one. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">Rustfmt</a> makes complying
with style guides a breeze. Unit tests are incredibly easy to write, requiring no
additional packages to run.</p>
<p>Rust will not replace either R or Python any time soon for scientific
applications though. A lot of the high-level building blocks available with a
few keystrokes in these languages are simply not available in Rust. But an
increasing number of people are working to fill in the gaps, particularly when
it comes to <a href="http://www.arewelearningyet.com/">machine learning</a>. Indeed, it
may be that Rust code becomes the metaphorical connective tissue binding together
neural networks, via bindings such as
<a href="https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs">tch</a>. It's a language that has its
place in the expanding universe of what we now call data science. Simulations,
statistical inference -- anything requiring dealing with data at a large scale
-- stands to benefit from learning more about this language. The cognitive
costs are ultimately worth it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>(San Francisco, CA)</em> - 2020 has been an interesting year for tech IPOs. Many would have expected a complete or near-complete freeze in companies going public with the pandemic ravaging global markets. Yet in true 2020 fashion, the opposite has happened: a flurry of hot companies have gone public this year, ranging from Snowflake to Palantir to Unity. And they're not done: longtime 🦄 unicorn 🦄 Airbnb is also expected to list before the year is out.</p>
<p>But Airbnb's debut to the public markets will feature a twist: a $55 "cleaning fee" will be attached to all shares. Shocked investors will be surpised to find that the $65 shares they were looking at will actually be $120 per share at the end of the day. When asked about the fee, CEO Brian Chesky had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That's a great question. At Airbnb, we value beautiful experiences over anything. We want our customers to be able to experience the rich, vibrant tapestries of cultures around the world and ensure that hosts are able to enjoy the financial benefits of helping us do so. When thinking about our IPO, we wanted to be sure our investors got the same, authentic Airbnb experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At time of writing, Doordash was considering following suit and attaching their own "delivery fee" to every share in their upcoming IPO.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Code and designs are completely disconnected. With nothing bridging the two, it’s up to you, the developer, to accurately recreate the designs into code. You inspect hundreds of layers, search your codebase, painstakingly compare with DevTools--wasting endless amounts of time, creating inconsistencies, and producing countless QA bugs.&nbsp;</p><p>At Contrast, we solve this by showing you the difference between your code and designs—effectively connecting your Storybook and Figma. You’ll be building UI at record speeds with insane accuracy.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss:</p><ul role="list"><li>The Great Divide between code and designs</li><li>Why we built a Storybook Addon to solve this problem</li><li>How Contrast + Storybook work together to help you build UI, faster</li></ul><p>Do you ever stare at a mockup and sigh? Everyday, I open Figma and wonder:</p><ul role="list"><li>Is this element already a component?</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Do we have a Story for it?</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Did I build it to spec?</li></ul><p>I comb through our codebase, manically compare the two, and inevitably ping my teammates—constantly wondering how to best recreate it. This uncertainty plagues our team with inconsistencies, meetings, headaches, and wasted time.</p><p>So why exactly is this happening? Well, I like to call this problem: The Great Divide.</p><figure id="w-node-b848d2015fb4-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5fced2e02296d20c69276aff_Frame%2021-min%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>As UI developers, we live in our own world; one with our own languages, environments, and cultures. But so do designers. Both are filled with amazing ideas and some of the smartest minds, but they’re disconnected...</p><p>Code lives in one space. Designs in another. There's no bridge between the two.</p><p>I've personally experienced this disconnect for years. While working for startups and building my own, I've seen the problems this separation causes. And it's because of this that we decided to build Contrast—a handoff tool that shows you the difference between your code and designs.</p><h5><strong>Why Storybook</strong></h5><p>When we were first thinking of how to solve this problem—we immediately went with Storybook for three reasons:</p><ol role="list"><li>We're Storybook users and know how vital it is when building, testing, and documenting our UI.</li><li>Storybook has an amazing community of developers who are passionate about the quality of their UI and the speed of their development.</li><li>Storybook is a well documented platform, letting us build an Addon that unlocks value to our users in a short period of time.</li></ol><p>Because of these reasons, it was clear we needed to start our journey here...</p><h5><strong>How our Addon works</strong></h5><p>After years of using the same slow, antiquated handoff tools and processes, we set out to rebuild and reimagine. Our goal was create a tool specifically built for <a href="https://www.componentdriven.org/">component-driven</a> teams—teams that care about consistency, quality, and speed.&nbsp;</p><p>So, we tailored Contrast to help you build UI blazingly fast with complete context—in 3 simple steps:</p><figure id="w-node-8ac376a222c4-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5fced3137c22193356e97cc2_Frame%2019-min%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><ol role="list"><li><strong>Mirror -</strong> Figma files stay mirrored in Contrast, keeping you in-sync with your designer.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Build &amp; Diff -</strong> Know if what you’ve coded matches the designs, while building in Storybook.</li><li><strong>Connect -</strong> Once your UI is built, connect the Story to the master Figma component. Transforming it into a living reference when inspecting designs in the future.</li></ol><figure id="w-node-d37d43ac5e48-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5fced335120d5b973f9fc461_Frame%2023-min.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h5>‍<strong>Mirror</strong></h5><p>Mirror your Figma files in Contrast—down to the exact pixel. If a change is made in Figma, everything stays perfectly in-sync with Contrast. No manual uploading. No worrying.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-67af6ca7f3f5-ccb706c6"></figure><h5>‍<strong>Build &amp; Diff</strong></h5><p>Forget tab-hopping and start inspecting designs directly in Storybook—side-by-side. Keep it all in-context and never lose your place again.&nbsp;<br></p><p>More importantly, as you’re building UI, Contrast tells you the difference between what you’ve coded and the designs. You can think of Diff like a spell-checker for UI developers. A tool that feels so magical, you’ll think it is. Say goodbye to inconsistencies, design bugs, and endless QA.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-21d6a6beae5b-ccb706c6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f08abd1a8581a1027bfc65a/5fced3910de175d5dd05cb71_Frame%2024-min%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h5>Connect<br></h5><p>Once you’ve built your component in Storybook, quickly connect it to the master component in Figma. Whenever you’re inspecting designs in the future, you’ll see the Story and Tokens on the designs instead of mismatched CSS. This connection will save you endless amounts of time as you continue to build out your product.&nbsp;<br></p><h5><strong>Get started</strong></h5><p>If you're interested in testing out Contrast to start building UI faster and more accurately, follow the simple steps below. You can also check out the <a href="https://storybook.js.org/addons">Addon Catalog</a> for more ways to customize and supercharge your Storybook.</p><p>1. Install the Addon</p><p>npm i storybook-contrast</p><p>2. Add the following to your .storybook/main.js exports:</p><p>module.exports = {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;addons: ['storybook-contrast'],<br>};</p><p>3. Add the following to your .storybook/preview-body.html:</p><p>  &lt;script id="contrast-snippet" src="https://contrast-snippet.s3.amazonaws.com/contrast-snippet.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</p><p>‍<br></p><p>Or, if this article has inspired you to create an Addon of your own, you can <a href="https://www.chromatic.com/blog/how-to-build-a-storybook-addon/">learn how to do it here</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>We are excited to announce that we signed a <a href="http://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/pixie-developer-first-observability" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">definitive agreement</a> to join New Relic -- an outcome we certainly never predicted after only just two years.</p><p>New Relic’s focus on the developer is legendary. When New Relic's Founder/CEO, Lew Cirne, first started tinkering around with Pixie and participating in our community, we noticed an alignment in our visions for the future of observability, as well as echoes of New Relic’s developer-centric roots in Pixie. Joining New Relic will provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to reach millions of developers faster by open-sourcing a self-managed version of Pixie in the upcoming months.</p><p>When we started Pixie in 2018, Kubernetes was rapidly gaining traction. We felt that a new approach to observability was needed due to the new, fundamental challenges in observing distributed, ephemeral systems. We founded Pixie in order to provide instant, flexible observability for developers like ourselves who were building applications on Kubernetes.</p><p>However, we knew that the most developer-friendly version of Pixie must be open-source. In a forward-looking move, New Relic is giving us the opportunity to open-source Pixie and focus on providing world-class observability to all developers. The developer community is a core element of New Relic’s vision, and Pixie’s open-source offering will be a key part of that initiative and the primary area of focus for the Pixie team going forward.</p><p>We are so excited to begin working with New Relic on our shared vision for the future of observability. In the coming months, we’ll be jointly committing our roadmap in the following initiatives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pixie Core</strong>: An open-source and self-managed version of Pixie which we will release to the CNCF sandbox early next year. As part of the process, we look forward to speaking with you about this at Kubecon-EU on May’21. Due to Pixie’s and New Relic’s commitment to open standards, we also plan to build out integrations with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pixie By New Relic</strong>: Our current Pixie Community offering will continue as a hosted version of Pixie Core and existing New Relic One customers will soon get instant access to Pixie data with a few clicks. Their existing experiences will be augmented with the metrics, logs, events, and application traces that Pixie automatically provides.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pixie by New Relic, Enterprise Edition</strong>: Industry-specific solutions for sectors such as Media, Telecommunications, and Government that allow enterprise customers to install Pixie entirely inside production clusters while meeting compliance, data security, support, and performance requirements.</p></li></ul><p>Finally, our journey is just beginning. We are a team of 12 people with a huge vision to reach every Kubernetes developer. As we embark on this part of our journey, we encourage anyone passionate about open source, Kubernetes, and observability to apply to join us <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>You can try out Pixie <a href="https://work.withpixie.ai/auth/signup?UTM=PXNR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, learn more about us <a href="https://pixielabs.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and ping us anytime on our Pixienaut community slack.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

December 10, 2020 | https://satchel.com/web-analytics/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://satchel.com/web-analytics/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main_content"><div><div><p>Last Updated </p><!-- --><p>May 30, 2020</p></div><div><p>Reading Times:</p><p>Summary only: 1 minute</p></div></div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Every YC batch, Michael Seibel gives a talk about building product. He'll ask: "<a href="https://youtu.be/C27RVio2rOs?t=1677">How many of you are using Google Analytics as your primary source of metrics?</a>" But it's a trick question. When the majority of the audience eventually raises their hands, he'll fake a sigh and tell everyone that they're doing it wrong, and that they should instead by relying on an event-based analytics tool.<span></span><span>The linked video is from Startup School, but the same talk is given at YC Core as well.</span></p><p>It's a perennial favorite, but don't let the humor distract you. Michael's got a
good point. Without using an event-based analytics tool, which tracks the interactions your users have with your product, you won't know <em>how</em> your
users are using your product. This is arguably just as important as actually
building out the product. There are a lot of event-based analytics tools out
there, but we think that if you're an early-stage startup, Heap makes the best tradeoffs.</p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b6fae69c970dbd3257184ea4d909f5d858810bdc/35c24/logos/heap.svg"></a></p><div><p>Our Recommendation</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/">Heap</a></p><p>Highest benefit-to-effort ratio</p><p>Gave us auto-tracking functionality, which we think is an exceptionally good safety net for an early-stage startup with rapidly-changing features and limited engineering resources, although it lacks some of the extensibility and more advanced analysis capabilities of its competitors. That said, we think this tradeoff best suits an early-stage startup.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://heap.io/">heap.io</a></p></div></div><summary><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><ul><li>"Setting up event-based metrics is something that's super important very early in your company, because it's how you know whether your product is being used or not. And it's the number one source of new product ideas and inspiration." - Michael Seibel</li><li>Google Analytics by itself is insufficient to figure out how your users are using your product, although it is useful to complement an event-based analytics tool.</li><li>Event-based analytics help you figure out what actions a user took on your website.</li><li>We are primarily focused on evaluating the three main event-based analytics tools: Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Heap.</li><li>We found that event-based analytics is a category of SaaS with some of the most feature parity.</li><li>The core analytics functionality of all three tools is more or less equivalent.</li><li>The key considerations for an early-stage startup are the amount of maintenance and discipline required to maintain useful analytics, and the ability to go far without spending a lot of money.</li><li>We found that defining events in code while having auto-track as a safety net is a near-ideal setup for an early stage startup.</li><li>We recommend Heap, because it is the only major analytics tool that offers this capability. The main downside for an early-stage startup is that you can't get as far on a free plan on Heap compared to Mixpanel or Amplitude.</li><li>If pricing is the main consideration, then we recommend Amplitude. Even though its product is oriented towards later-stage companies, Amplitude has the most generous free plan of the major event-based analytics providers.</li></ul></summary><h2 id="ratings-matrix">Ratings Matrix</h2><h2 id="context">Context</h2><h3 id="what-is-event-based-analytics">What is event-based analytics?</h3><p>Pageview-based analytics tools like Google Analytics and event-based analytics tools such as Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Heap are typically grouped together under the heading of analytics tools. However, we think that lumping them all under the same heading is misleading, because they fundamentally do different things. To better understand what event-based analytics are, we need to understand what exactly Google Analytics does, figure out where its gaps are, and then use that context to motivate event-based analytics tools. </p><p>Google Analytics uses a pageview-driven paradigm, a holdover from what was important in the early 2000s. Its focus on pageviews helps answer questions such as how many users came to your website, what pages they visited, and how they found your website. Unfortunately, it isn't able to help you figure out which specific actions a user performed on any given page of your website. For example, it doesn't answer whether a user clicked on a CTA button, if they abandoned their cart, how far they got into signing up, or what part of the page they were looking at before they converted. Answering these kinds of questions can be quite informative to early-stage startups' decision-making, and can be accomplished quite easily by using an event-based analytics tool.</p><p>An event-based tool will provide two things: an interface to collect "events", and an interface to analyze those events. You can define and implement your events (commonly referred to as instrumenting) by calling the API of the event-based analytics tool you're using.</p><p>To illustrate, let's say you run an ecommerce store. You want to figure out what types of items people checkout without hesitation, and what types of items often result in abandoned carts. This isn't something that can be accomplished with pageview-based analytics tools such as Google Analytics. However, this can be performed quite easily with an event-based analytics tool. If you track two events — when someone adds something to their cart, and when someone checks out their cart — you can figure out which SKUs lead to a high checkout rate, and which SKUs lead to abandoned carts. This is implemented by calling two functions: </p><ol><li><p>a function <code>track('add-to-cart', {&lt;metadata&gt;})</code>, including metadata about the item added (e.g. SKU, name, price) in your code that executes when someone adds something to cart, and </p></li><li><p>a similar function <code>track('checkout', {&lt;metadata&gt;})</code> in your code that runs when someone checkouts. Data from these events will be sent to your analytics provider, which will provide an interface to analyze and draw conclusions from your data.</p></li></ol><p>This is a simple example, but is already quite a powerful tool to understand your users, and can be easily extended. The same power generalizes beyond an ecommerce store to any startup's web product, helping one answer essential questions such as: Is your CTA convincing? What are the characteristics of products that customers are the most hesitant about buying? What part of the signup process needs to be improved to prevent potential users from dropping off? Which portion of your product page was the most engaging and persuaded customers to take the next step?</p><h3 id="early-stage-startups-and-their-analytics-dilemma">Early-stage startups and their analytics dilemma</h3><p>If event-based analytics are so important for early-stage startups, one might rightly wonder why so many YC startups, whose founders are quite sharp in aggregate, rely primarily on Google Analytics?</p><p>It turns out that this is a rather illuminating question. The main contributor to this phenomenon is easy to understand and empathize with. Startups are busy and overworked, and analytics are often ostensibly seen as orthogonal to the priorities of understanding their users and building product<span></span><span>The <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-essential-startup-advice/">canonical priorities</a> for early-stage startups.</span>. Therefore, event-based analytics often fall to the wayside as they typically require engineering time and discipline to maintain. If you forget to update an event, or don't have time to implement analytics for a new feature, then you can't get any benefit out of it at all.</p><p>Yet, in reality, event-based analytics are one of the best sources of new product insights and inspiration and are a fantastic way to understand how your users are using your product. This is one of our main motivations for writing this particular guide. Early-stage startups have a unique set of challenges to face, particularly around prioritizing their time and engineering resources. That said, we think that there's an approach that can make event-based analytics require a lot less discipline, and therefore make it a lot more attainable for an early-stage startup.</p><h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2><p>Based on a few years of first-hand experience using and testing event-based analytics tools, in addition to aggregating feedback from other founders, we have found the following factors matter most for early-stage startups choosing an analytics tool:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Core Analytics Functionality</strong> refers to the standard analytics features that are critical for an early-stage startup to understand their users. These include standard analysis tools, such as funnel analysis (i.e. figuring out when users drop out in each step of a process), retention analysis (i.e. figuring out how many users churn, and when), and cohort analysis (i.e. figuring out how different user segments interact with your product). </p></li><li><p><strong>Robustness / Ease of Maintenance:</strong> Early-stage startups need to use analytics just as much as larger companies, but also have to be a lot more resourceful and focused with their time and energy. What happens if you change a component, and don't update the tracking code? What happens if you're under time pressure from a customer and make the conscious decision to launch a complex product without tracking? While large companies have the ability to implement strict QA processes and are okay with extended deadlines, early-stage startups don't have these options. Therefore, we've kept a close eye out for how each analytics tool performs under less-than-ideal situations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affordability:</strong> Web analytics tools are somewhat notable/notorious for giving generous free plans, attaining lock-in, and then making things more expensive once your company starts becoming successful <span></span><span>This is one of the reasons why <a href="#consider-using-segment-as-a-wrapper">we suggest using Segment</a>, since it helps you avoid vendor lock-in and gives you more negotiating power.</span>. That said, several analytics tools have generous free tiers or deals that can last you quite a long time without paying. Therefore, we've split this criterion into two subcriteria: <strong>How far you can get without paying</strong>, and <strong>Paid Plan Affordability</strong>. The latter is actually somewhat non-trivial to evaluate, because most analytics providers hide their pricing behind a Contact Us gate, even for early-stage startups. That said, we got our hands on a decent amount of data on the actual cost of each service, and we have also compiled a list of typical discounts and deals that you can reasonably expect to get from each analytics provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ease…</strong></p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>During the eight years I spent as an engineering manager, I regularly tracked how I spent my time. As a startup engineering manager, I was responsible for a wide range of duties, so keeping track of which areas I spent the most time on helped me plan and schedule appropriately.</p>
<p>For example, I knew that I typically spent about 1/3rd of my time helping my team solve technical problems or pairing with teammates. Knowing this, I reserved some free blocks of time for them. If my whole week were full of meetings and big-picture planning, I’d become a blocker for my team who needed my input on specific issues.</p>
<p>Since many prospective software engineering managers ask me about my job and what it entails, I decided to create this detailed look at how I spent my time. While every company and role is different, I hope this post gives you some first-hand insight into a day in the life of an engineering manager.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for some books to help you on your journey as a software engineering manager, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some of my favorites</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="what-does-an-engineering-manager-do">What Does an Engineering Manager Do?</h2>
<p>First, a little bit about my roles as an engineering manager: my first management role was at <a href="https://www.packback.co/">Packback</a>, a question and answer platform for college professors.</p>
<p>I joined the team when there were just four people in the company - it was essentially myself and the founders. In the intervening three years, I saw the company raise close to $5 million and grow to almost 30 people. My engineering team was pretty lean - there were five when I left in 2016 - but my role changed quite a bit over my years with the company.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/joining-the-graide-network">I left Packback to join The Graide Network</a>, I started over as an engineering manager. Initially, my team was just a contractor and me, but over my four years at Graide, I <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hiring-process">hired three other engineers</a> and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/product-management-process">took on more of the product management duties</a>.</p>
<p>While my day-to-day work changed a lot over the years, <strong>as a software engineering manager, I was ultimately responsible for helping my team ship software that worked as expected on schedule and within budget.</strong></p>
<p>The tricky word there is “helping.” What does that mean exactly? Does it mean that an engineering manager writes code? Or do they just make sure everyone on their team is writing code?</p>
<p>The short answer is: it depends.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-managers-must-be-technical">Engineering Managers Must be Technical</h3>
<p>Generally, engineering managers write less code than the senior developers on their team, but <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/do-engineering-managers-need-to-write-code-d89903d68e8d">they should write some code to keep their skills sharp</a>. They also need to be good at helping their team members get “unstuck.” Sometimes this means answering technical questions, and sometimes it means solving disputes between team members.</p>
<p>They’re likely to play a role in <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/developing-talent">training new engineers</a> as well as evaluating candidates on a technical and interpersonal basis.</p>
<h3 id="engineering-managers-have-to-be-good-with-people">Engineering Managers Have to be Good with People</h3>
<p>Being “good with people” is a tough label to nail down.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/e7ML5PR.gif" alt="I have people skills! - Office Space"></p>
<p>Many people assume that you have to be an extrovert to be an effective manager, <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/are-extroverts-the-best-leaders-maybe-not.html">but that’s not necessarily true</a>. Having empathy for your team and helping them through challenges - both technical and personal - is one of an engineering manager’s primary mandates.</p>
<p>But, engineering managers have to “manage up” as well. This means they need to look out for their team’s best interests when their boss asks them for feedback, and it means they might have to let a team member go if they’re not getting the job done.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardest-part-about-engineering-management">The Hardest Part About Engineering Management</h3>
<p>As I moved into my first management role, the most challenging part was adjusting my method for self-evaluation. Nickolas Means says it well in his <a href="https://leaddev.com/self-care-burnout/learning-love-meta-productivity">fantastic piece on meta productivity for managers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every so often, I have a day where I look up after the last meeting has ended and feel like I’ve gotten absolutely nothing done. I’ve been busy all day long: having conversations, reading documents, and checking in with peers and team members. I’m exhausted, but I’ve accomplished nothing.” - Nickolas Means</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was <em>relatively</em> easy for me to tell how productive I had been as a software engineer. I usually made progress on shipping a feature or opened up a pull request, but as a manager, I had a really hard time telling whether my day was productive or not.</p>
<p>That’s why I started tracking my time. While time spent on a task is not a perfect measurement of productivity, it helped me make sure I was investing enough time into each area of my job.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-an-engineering-manager-spend-their-time">How Does an Engineering Manager Spend Their Time?</h2>
<p>Engineering managers tend to have a wide range of responsibilities, and these responsibilities vary based on the employer’s size and organizational structure. To help you see how an engineering manager spends their time, I broke my time down into four categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical</strong> (35%)</li>
<li><strong>Managerial</strong> (35%)</li>
<li><strong>Recruiting</strong> (15%)</li>
<li><strong>Administrative</strong> (15%)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, you’ll see how I spent my time as an engineering manager. I’ll offer a little bit about the specific tasks encompassed in each area and why it was an important part of my daily work.</p>
<p>While I tracked my time pretty rigidly for periods of my 8-year management career, I decided to round each category to a nice round number for the sake of simplicity. Exact hours spent on each task aren’t the point here, but I found it helpful to know if one area spiked in one week or dropped sharply in another.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tx9pTaz.png" alt="engineering-manager-time"></p>
<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<p><em>35% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Technical work includes writing code, code reviews, hunting down bugs, pairing with teammates, and reading software updates and best practices. As my teams grew, the amount of time I devoted to writing and reviewing code dwindled, but I do think it’s important for engineering managers to spend at least <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/engineering-managers-should-code-30-of-t/240165174">some of their time elbows deep in the code</a>.</p>
<h3 id="managerial">Managerial</h3>
<p><em>35% of my time.</em></p>
<p>This includes direct people management, creating timelines, strategic planning, and meetings with technical and non-technical team members. Making sure my team was happy, advocating for them in business meetings, and helping our product team create technical specs were all part of my engineering manager duties at Packback.</p>
<p>At The Graide Network, I took a more strategic role by consulting with the founders on software choices and jumping in on important sales calls. Interestingly, while the tasks I took on were different, the time breakdown was pretty similar.</p>
<h3 id="recruiting">Recruiting</h3>
<p><em>15% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Recruiting time included going to conferences, meetups, and coding bootcamps, writing blog posts, meeting with job candidates, and evaluating technical screenings.</p>
<p>While I spent more of my time on recruiting when I had an open engineering job, smart engineering managers are <em>always</em> hiring. The best candidates are usually the passive ones who rarely look for a job, so I spent a portion of my time getting in front of them each week.</p>
<h3 id="administrative">Administrative</h3>
<p><em>15% of my time.</em></p>
<p>Finally, I spent a few hours per week reading and writing emails, answering questions in Slack, random conversations, and “other” day-to-day things to support my team. As the manager, I tried to keep these kinds of distractions away from my engineering team, but I’d schedule time with team members when necessary.</p>
<p>If an engineering manager’s job is to make their team as productive as possible, it stands to reason that most of the administrative work will fall to them.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-good-engineering-manager">What Makes a Good Engineering Manager?</h2>
<p>I don’t think I can give you <em>everything</em> you need to know about being a good engineering manager in just one blog post (<a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some good books on the topic though</a>), so I’ll just pick the three things that I focus on first.</p>
<h3 id="1-empower-your-team">1. Empower Your Team</h3>
<p>Being a good manager is all about <a href="http://www.jrothman.com/articles/1999/01/successful-engineering-management-7-lessons-learned/">helping others achieve great things</a>.</p>
<p>This means that as a manager, your <a href="https://leaddev.com/self-care-burnout/learning-love-meta-productivity">impact is much less direct</a>, and therefore, you can’t spend all your time heads down in the code. It was frustrating for me to see my weekly accomplishments list shrink, but once I learned to accept that my team was getting more done without my individual contributions, I started to really enjoy the role.</p>
<h3 id="2-overcommunicate">2. Overcommunicate</h3>
<p>Whether your team is working in one room or working <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/managing-remote-engineering">remotely across the world</a>, communication is one of your most crucial roles as a manager. In marketing, there’s an idea that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-nagging-repetition-effective-communication-marton-jojarth/">people must hear your message seven times before they internalize it</a>, and I think this applies to team communication as well.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you should repeat everything seven times in the same meeting, but think about reiterating significant changes in one-on-ones, group settings, via email, and in passing. Change is scary, but the more people hear about something, the less scary it tends to be.</p>
<h3 id="3-be-the-source-of-calm">3. Be the Source of Calm</h3>
<p>Finally, as the engineering manager, your role is to “<a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/07/07/dont-create-chaos.html">vacuum up chaos</a>:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. Good leaders can walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and get everyone aligned on a clear path forward.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t create or perpetuate drama, divide your team from the rest of the company, or pit team members against each other. Instead, be the one who absorbs uncertainty and stress so your team can get sh** done.</p>

<p>If you’re an aspiring engineering manager or you’re just wondering what your boss does all day, I hope this helps you.</p>

<p><span>Even worse, how many times have </span><i><span>you</span></i><span> been the one complaining about a cable provider?</span></p>
<p><span>Complaints about cable companies might sound like cliches. But cable providers aren’t like the DMV or the post office —&nbsp;services that draw a lot of consumer ire but ultimately tend to be doing their best to get their jobs done. On the contrary, cable companies have actually been </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/comcast-biggest-scams-claim-cash/"><span>caught engaging in a lot of shady behaviors</span></a><span> that fully justify their customers’ complaints.</span></p>
<p><span>But what if you want to take your dispute with your cable company further than your watercooler chat? What do you do if you have a legitimate complaint about your cable company that you need resolved? Where do you go if you need help getting justice against a cable company that’s gone beyond just providing an unpleasant customer service experience —&nbsp;but has actually wronged you?</span></p>
<p><span>These are questions that a lot of consumers have, and we’re here to help. In this article, we’ll discuss some of the common reasons people might want to seek justice against their cable companies. Then, we’ll explain, step-by-step, how to file a complaint against a cable company, and point you toward some resources that will be on your side if you need help getting justice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Why Do So Many People Have Complaints About Their Cable Companies?</span></h2>
<p><span>Let’s start at the beginning: Why do so many people complain about cable companies? And, more importantly, are people complaining about just annoyances, or actual injustices?</span></p>
<p><span>The American Consumer Satisfaction Index </span><a href="https://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148&amp;Itemid=213"><span>surveys consumers</span></a><span> and scores industries based on how well they provide satisfactory services at fair prices. Consistently, year after year, the cable TV industry ranks lowest out of the dozens of industries the ACSI tracks.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image.jpg" alt="Graph of American Consumer Satisfaction Index Scores for the Cable TV Industry" width="2022" height="1825" srcset="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image.jpg 2022w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-300x271.jpg 300w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-1024x924.jpg 1024w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-768x693.jpg 768w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-1536x1386.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2022px) 100vw, 2022px" data-srcset="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image.jpg 2022w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-300x271.jpg 300w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-1024x924.jpg 1024w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-768x693.jpg 768w, https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image-1536x1386.jpg 1536w" data-src="https://4bvihq1vzfw92gpacq41usu0-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/01-Image.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>
<p><span>In 2020, the cable industry has scored </span><a href="https://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=149&amp;catid=&amp;Itemid=212&amp;i=Subscription+Television+Service"><span>64 out of 100 points on the ACSI index</span></a><span>, which is actually a 3.2 percent increase over last year. But the industry still has the lowest score in the ACSI rankings, reflecting more dissatisfied customers than ISPs, cell phone providers, online news media, and many other industries that consumers love to complain about. Additionally, this year is the first time since 2016 that the cable industry saw an increase in its ACSI ranking.</span></p>
<p><span>ACSI rankings aren’t even the worst evidence against the cable industry, though.</span></p>
<p><span>News reports reveal that some of what cable companies have been up to goes beyond just bad customer service. For example,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Some AT&amp;T customers found they were </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/att-overcharging-customers-complaints"><span>being charged three times the rate</span></a><span> the company promised them. The situation was so bad, one legal expert called AT&amp;T’s policies “a license to steal.”</span></li>
<li><span>Comcast </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/comcast-biggest-scams-claim-cash"><span>wrongly charged a small business owner $1,800 in cancelation fees</span></a><span>, and then spent </span><i><span>two years</span></i><span> fighting against returning that wronged customer’s money.</span></li>
<li><span>Cox employees were found to be </span><a href="https://wjla.com/features/7-on-your-side/cox-communications-complaints-fake-accounts"><span>creating customer accounts without permission</span></a><span> so they could charge users more.</span></li>
<li><span>Optimum got caught advertising a $99 promotion rate, but </span><a href="https://www.thehour.com/business/article/After-profitable-2017-Altice-USA-hikes-Optimum-12885236.php"><span>actually billed users more than $160 for it</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>DirecTV </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-news/feds-sue-direct-tv-claim-money"><span>broke its contracts with 33 million customers</span></a><span> by wrongly raising their rates.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>These are just some examples of how cable companies have done shady (or even outright illegal) things to their customers. In all these cases (and any others like them), the customers deserve justice. But it can be difficult to figure out how to get it.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to File a Complaint Against a Cable Company</span></h2>
<p><span>The exact process for filing a complaint might vary from one cable company to the next. For more detailed advice about taking on a specific company, visit our consumer guides.</span></p>
<p><span>But no matter what cable company your dispute is with, there are certain steps you can take to file and escalate your complaint. Here’s what you need to know.</span></p>
<h3><span>Step 1: Contact the Cable Company</span></h3>
<p><span>For anyone who’s suffered through an unproductive customer service call, this probably won’t be welcome news. But any time you have a complaint against a company, before taking it to any outside agencies, you need to try to resolve it with the company itself. This is important, because if you end up escalating your complaint to the FTC, FCC, or a local franchising authority, they’ll expect that you’ve already tried to resolve your dispute with the company directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Some best practices to keep in mind here: Try to address the complaint with your cable company in writing, whenever possible. Email is a great option for this. This ensures that you have a record of exactly what’s said by both parties, and you have proof that you attempted to resolve the complaint directly with the cable company, as well as proof of why that didn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve tried this and your cable company was unable or unwilling to help you reach a resolution, it’s time for step two.</span></p>
<h3><span>Step 2: Find the Right Regulatory Agency</span></h3>
<p><span>If your cable company is unable or unwilling to help you, you can escalate your complaint to a regulatory agency. However, finding the right one can be a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span>Cable companies are overseen by a number of entities: The Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, public utility commissions, and local franchising authorities are the ones that are likely to be most relevant to any dispute you might have. Here’s where this gets complicated: Each of them has different jurisdiction and can only help with certain issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s who you should contact, depending on your complaint.</span></p>

<h4><span>Local Franchising Authorities</span></h4>
<p><span>Local franchising authorities are government organizations that regulate cable TV service at a municipal, county, or other local level. You can usually find the name of your local franchising authority on your cable bill. If not, you can contact your cable company or your local town or city hall to request that information.</span></p>
<p><span>Local franchising authorities can help you with these issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rates for basic service and equipment, and service charges related to basic cable.</span></li>
<li><span>Rates for cable service tiers, particularly if rates for your cable service have been increased within the past 90 days.</span></li>
<li><span>Customer service problems, like availability of customer service representatives, office hours, timeliness of service visits, and outages.</span></li>
<li><span>Franchise fees.</span></li>
<li><span>Signal quality.</span></li>
<li><span>Use of public or informational channels that are required as part of your cable company’s franchise agreement.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Public Utility Commissions</span></h4>
<p><span>In some states, public utility commissions oversee certain issues related to cable or satellite TV services.</span></p>
<p><span>To find out more about your state’s public utility commission, check the </span><a href="https://www.naruc.org/about-naruc/regulatory-commissions/"><span>National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners</span></a><span>. If your state has one, PUCs can help you with these issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Rates and programming for stand-alone satellite TV services.</span></li>
<li><span>Rates and programming for stand-alone cable TV services (not including basic tier plans).</span></li>
<li><span>Installation of cable or satellite TV services that are not bundled with other services.</span></li>
<li><span>Burial of phone or cable TV wires.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Federal Communications Commission</span></h4>
<p><span>The FCC is a department of the federal government that exists to regulate businesses and prevent them from taking advantage of or unfairly treating consumers.</span></p>
<p><span>There are a number of ways you can contact the FCC if you have a complaint about a cable company that falls under its jurisdiction. You can visit the </span><a href="https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us"><span>FCC Complaint Center</span></a><span> to file your complaint online or get the right information to mail it, or you can call 1-888-225-5322 for information and general questions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC can help with these kinds of complaints:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Equal Opportunity Employment complaints.</span></li>
<li><span>Signal leakage that might affect other spectrum users.</span></li>
<li><span>Cable companies that violate rules about home cable wiring.</span></li>
<li><span>Cable companies that violate commercial limits during kids’ programming.</span></li>
<li><span>Indecency or obscenity on a cable TV program.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><span>Federal Trade Commission</span></h4>
<p><span>And finally, the right entity to receive your complaint might be the FTC, which is another department of the federal government. It has similar goals to the FCC, but oversees different things.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also similarly to the FCC, you have a few options for contacting the FTC about your complaint. You can use an </span><a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/"><span>online complaint portal</span></a><span>, or you can reach the agency by phone at 1-877-FTC-HELP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some of the types of complaints that would fall under the jurisdiction of the FTC:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-guides/false-advertising-and-misleading-marketing/"><span>False advertising</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Deceptive business practices.</span></li>
<li><span>Scams.</span></li>
<li><span>Problems with debt collection.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>What to Expect After Filing a Complaint Against a Cable Company</span></h2>
<p><span>After filing a complaint with any of the entities listed above, you might be wondering what comes next. The answer, unfortunately, is that it depends.</span></p>
<p><span>Regulatory agencies, particularly at the federal level, will typically investigate a company if they receive complaints about it. If they find that the company did, in fact, do something wrong, they may impose fines or other punishments. But typically, a federal agency like the FTC or the FCC </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/consumer-guides/getting-your-refund/"><span>won’t help you get a refund</span></a><span>, get charges reversed, or get justice in any other, similar way. For that, you have other resources.</span></p>
<h2><span>How to Get Justice Against a Cable Company</span></h2>
<p><span>If resolving your dispute means getting a refund, a zero balance, other compensation, or some other form of justice, you might feel like you have a long, uphill road to climb.</span></p>
<p><span>Most cable companies have clauses built into their contracts that say you can’t sue them, unless it’s in small claims court. But what you can do is </span><a href="https://fairshake.com/how-it-works/"><span>take advantage of consumer arbitration</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Arbitration works a little bit like small claims: You’ll send a legal demand to your cable company, and then collect any evidence you have and present it to an independent third party, or arbitrator. The arbitrator will hear both sides of the dispute and make a legally binding decision.</span></p>
<p><span>But even that might sound overwhelming. And if you’ve never been through the process of arbitration before, we don’t blame you if you feel intimidated by the paperwork, the process, or just the thought of taking on a big company with major legal resources.</span></p>

<p>Over the past few years, I see a trend taking shape for tech executives, and that is learning how to cooperate with their counterparts in HR (nowadays, sometimes called “VP People”). At its core, this change has a lot of positive benefits. By having partners for taking care of the company’s culture and environment, leaders can devote more time to other responsibilities. Further, it is healthy to have more people involved in the wellbeing of the employees and care about making time for things like personal development and training, aiding with performance reviews, and enabling a platform for ongoing training.</p>



<p>However, I have recently come across too many companies that take this too far. Let me start with a disclaimer: I know quite a few very talented HR executives that have helped their companies tremendously. My beef is with the tech executives who are, in a sense, <em>abdicating their own responsibilities</em>.</p>



<p>Here are a few scenarios that I see more and more of in the industry. If you can spot these taking place in your organization, I urge you to take 30 minutes to introspect about this and whether you are using HR as a crutch.</p>



<h3>Daily Management and Regular Feedback</h3>



<p>Even if you think it makes sense, you should not try and create a scheme where engineering managers or tech leads perform only “professional management,” and the “rest” is taken up by HR. I have heard of this notion and, frankly, think it makes no sense. Assuming that HR will not take part in technical discussions or interviews, they will be unaware of a big part of the “rest” that they’d be supposed to manage (i.e., soft skills). Also, these kinds of structures result in needless complexity and an organization that feels bureaucratic. </p>



<h3>Performance Feedback and Firing</h3>



<p>More common than daily management is (ab)using HR to do the dirty work of management. Managers <a href="https://avivbenyosef.com/dont-shy-away-or-risk-cowardly-management/">shy away</a> from providing negative feedback promptly. Instead, they let it get staler and staler until matters reach a point-of-no-return and then escalate it to HR to deal with.</p>



<p>I especially dislike the tendency to leave matters like demotions and letting people go to HR. These are your people, you and your management team hired them and are managing them. To paraphrase Eddard Stark, the manager who passes the sentence should swing the sword.</p>



<h3>Person in the Middle</h3>



<p>Another emerging pattern is that HR is used to replace direct communication between employees and their managers—in both directions. An employee has a complaint and brings it up in front of HR. Sometimes this even reaches absurd situations where managers are notified by HR of the issue but have to pretend they are unaware. This flawed communication stream, which resembles school kids playing a game of telephone more than a professional environment, is a dead giveaway for HR abuse.</p>



<h3>Deciding on Training</h3>



<p>Lastly, you ought not to completely delegate the formation of trainings and growth experiences for your team outside of technical circles. Cooperating with HR to do so effectively is great, but at the end of the day, you and your team are the only ones who can evaluate professional content, even if it’s not purely technical, like management training.</p>



<p>As someone who has delivered his fair share of such content or was brought in to companies after others have, I see how often it is that these end up having no tangible ROI. People invested a few hours sitting in a room together. They may have enjoyed the food between sessions or the concept of the company investing in their growth, and that’s it. No actual changes in the way they work, no improvements or changes to the way things are done afterward.</p>



<p>Tech executives are great at the <em>tech</em> part, but the <em>executive</em> half is an integral part of the job. It requires handling these situations, even if HR will gladly help you with them. It is fine to consult with them, but the responsibility, my friend, remains yours. Take ownership of these and work with your management team to treat them as they would the technical aspects of their work.</p>

        <div>
          <h2 id="discovering-the-problem">Discovering the Problem</h2><p>Startups are swallowing corporations' markets. This is mainly because corporations struggle with innovation, regardless of how much they use that word in press releases and PPT presentations. About 7 years ago we started <a href="http://www.codelitt.com/">Codelitt</a>, a corporate skunkworks and product incubator company. We build startups for corporations and invest 20% of our time in building products, tools, and <a href="https://github.com/codelittinc">open source projects</a> for the web. </p><p>In the beginning, we didn't set out to discover a specific problem. Put another way, we weren't being purposeful about searching for a problem to solve. This post is half about the problem with corporate innovation and half about our discovery process that led us to where we are today:</p><h2 id="eye-opening">Eye-opening</h2><p>In the beginning of my career I worked for investors in Latin America helping to build and launch startups before later moving to corporate America. Although I'm often critical of corporate culture, it was really eye opening and integral to my career. Really this is one of the best pieces of advice I can give to entrepreneurs looking for problems to solve:</p><blockquote>If you are smart and ambitious but can't find a problem to solve, go work for a large (preferably traditional) corporation. You'll find plenty there.</blockquote><p>Large enterprises succeed <em>in spite</em> of themselves. It really is a wonder that they get anything done at all. I can't speak for every single large company, but I've worked with quite a few. In one way or another they all have systemic issues. This is not to say that startups or more modern tech companies don't have their own issues. We do. But the proof is in the pudding and startups are launching products monthly that will take a huge chunk of traditional companies' markets or even render them completely irrelevant.</p><p>Some large enterprises have realized that their biggest threat isn't another corporate giant, it's some unknown kid building something. In order to compete, they have to create new value, do a little disruption of their own, and start shipping.</p><blockquote>However, traditional companies spend millions in R&amp;D and take several years to come to market.</blockquote><p>So the question is, why are they at such a disadvantage when their seemingly endless budgets should afford them a solid advantage? The answer is that the same tools, systems, and culture that they rely on to manage their large organization don't work for innovation and skunkworks teams.</p><h2 id="decisions-by-consensus">Decisions by Consensus</h2><p>Traditionally the vast majority make decisions by consensus. Note: there is a difference between collaboration and consensus. Collaboration takes different points into account but can still have one decision maker, whereas consensus decision making requires every single person to have input and be onboard. This is crippling to organizations. Teams should have a single decision maker.</p><p>Any startup who has experienced the sales cycle of a large company can attest to this first hand. While many sales people focus on identifying "the decision maker level," this person is rarely the only decision maker and they'll likely have an entire team to convince. When making a sales pitch (even for a $1,000 a month SaaS product) you'll very likely spend time in a room of 12 or so people from different areas of the company. Most of those people will likely have different needs and agendas. The same is true when it comes to developing new products, processes, or strategy. Decision making time is multiplied by an exponential factor.</p><blockquote>In the time it takes a large organization to make a decision just to move forward with something, a startup could have built, launched, and validated a new feature or model.</blockquote><h2 id="corporate-it">Corporate IT</h2><p>There are a number of reasons why normal innovation processes, product prototyping, and building new business models is so costly inside a large organization. Time is a huge factor. A close second is the cost of actual development. As with everything, I'm sure there are reasons for why things are done the way they are done. But from a product development perspective and coming from the startup world, they are nearly impossible to understand.</p><p>Corporate IT departments have a hard time looking at a product as something that develops. They see a project as having a start date, an end date, and a full set of features. There is no iterative development. They plan for every possible scenario and build to the full spec. Version releases begin with 1.0.0 launch and following releases are security patches at best.</p><p>Instead of using open source tools, large IT teams are locked in to Microsoft and Oracle products. I've never been able to understand why this is completely. It could be the fact that they spend a solid chunk of time earning Oracle or Microsoft Certifications. It could be the comfort of having support just a phone call away. Or it could even be an unwillingness to learn something new. </p><p>From a security perspective, it's like looking for a babysitter to watch your kids, asking for her recommendations, and she tells you, "Just trust me. I promise your child is secure. But just so you know, we'll be doing things my way; your house rules don't apply."</p><p>From a time perspective, there are open source technologies that allow you to whip up an MVP in much less time. Even with complaints about Rail's "magic under the hood," you can't deny that it's a powerful tool to quickly build a prototype.</p><p>From a cost perspective, licenses are expensive and they add up quickly. Millions of dollars are spent on IT licensing every year by large orgs. Imagine if that money was spent on employing core devs for the respective clients like we've seen with Red Hat, Bitpay, and Google.</p><blockquote>Developing a new product or business can often cost millions to develop with the traditional IT infrastructure and business processes. Timelines, again, are measured in years, not weeks.</blockquote><h2 id="risk-averse">Risk-averse</h2><p>The final piece to the puzzle which impedes progress and innovation is often a risk-averse nature. Being risk-averse is 'consultant speak' inside a large organization. Entire teams are dedicated to mitigating risk. I've heard a lot of different theories for why this is from insiders and outsiders over the years:</p><p><strong>Job security</strong> is one that gets floated around a lot. The 25 year Rolex, the benefits, and the cushy salary really don't require a whole lot. Don't upset the status quo, don't argue with the wrong people, play the politics, and work well with others. Do those 4 things and you have very little to worry about. Large companies rarely fire people who do those things. It's easy for anyone to become complacent when basic needs are taken care of. Unfortunately for them however, disruption requires risk. There's always the risk of being wrong. Being wrong is rarely celebrated in corporate culture and that stigma can follow someone around for the rest of their career preventing any sort of upward mobility. In our world, many of us have failed a few times, succeeded a couple, and worked for several companies. Our entire attitude towards failure and opportunity is a completely different perspective.</p><p>Another is the <strong>high visibility</strong> that corporations have in the public eye. Because of their size, most things they do are considered <a href="http://www.mediacollege.com/journalism/news/newsworthy.html">newsworthy</a> due to the impact it could have on their customers, employees, or investors. In the startup world, we have the luxury of being able to fail relatively quietly. Our customers and beta users are usually very understanding of certain degrees of failures to the point they even expect them. Remember those corporate departments dedicated to risk management? These often include legal, public relations, and marketing communications teams. They all have the responsibility to keep the public face of the company as free from blemishes as possible.</p><blockquote>Disruption requires risk. No great invention, change, or innovation ever came from doing the same thing over and over. <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/not-innovating/">You have to be ready to break things along the way</a>.</blockquote><h2 id="their-disadvantage">Their Disadvantage</h2><p>When you begin to understand the issues that are faced by teams tasked with innovation projects, skunkworks programs, or disrupting old models you can see how simple objectives for us turn into difficult ones for them. While many of us perhaps envy their resources, they're actually at a huge disadvantage to us in every other way. They have a massive problem, one that we set out to solve:</p><blockquote>For them innovation, product development, and skunkworks is expensive, slow, regulated, ineffective, and swimming against the current.</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>It’s the end of CentOS as we know it</strong></p><p>Earlier this week, the CentOS project announced the shift <a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/">to CentOS stream</a>. In a nutshell, this means that they will discontinue being a close clone of RHEL along with security updates, and instead it will serve as a development branch of RHEL.</p><p>As you can probably imagine (or gleam from the comments in that post I referenced), a lot of people are unhappy about this.</p><p>One particular quote got my attention this morning while catching up on this <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/838889/">week’s edition of Linux Weekly News</a>, under the distributions quotes section:</p><blockquote><p>I have been doing this for 17 years and CentOS is basically my life’s work. This was (for me personally) a heart wrenching decision. However, i see no other decision as a possibility. If there was, it would have been made.</p><cite><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/839521/">Johnny Hughes</a></cite></blockquote><p>I feel really sorry for this person and can empathize, I’ve been in similar situations in my life before where I’ve poured all my love and energy into something and then due to some corporate or organisational decisions (and usually poor ones), the project got discontinued and all that work that went into it vanishes into the ether. Also, 17 years is really long to be contributing to any one project so I can imagine that this must have been especially gutting.</p><p><strong>Throw me a freakin’ bone here</strong></p><p>I’m also somewhat skeptical of how successful CentOS Stream will really be in any form of a community project. It seems that Red Hat is expecting that volunteers should contribute to their product development for free, and then when these contributors actually want to use that resulting product, they’re expected to pay a corporate subscription fee to do so. This seems like a very lop-sided relationship to me, and I’m not sure it will be sustainable in the long term. In <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">Red Hat’s announcement of CentOS Stream</a>, they kind of throw the community a bone by saying “In the first half of 2021, we plan to introduce low- or no-cost programs for a variety of use cases”- it seems likely that this will just be for experimental purposes similar to the <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">Windows Insider program</a> and won’t be of much use for production users at all.</p><p>Red Hat does point out that their <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/ubi">Universal Base Image</a> (UBI) is free to use and that users could just use that on any system in a container, but this doesn’t add much comfort to the individuals and organisations who have contributed huge amounts of time and effort to CentOS over the years who rely on a stable, general-purpose Linux system that can be installed on bare metal.</p><p><strong>Way forward for CentOS users</strong></p><p>Where to from here? I suppose CentOS users could start coughing up for RHEL subscriptions. For many CentOS use cases that won’t make much sense. They could move to another distribution, or fork/restart CentOS. The latter is already happening. One of the original founders of the CentOS project, Gregory Kurtzer, is now working on <a href="https://rockylinux.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://rockylinux.org/">Rocky Linux</a>, which aims to be a new free system built from the RHEL sources.</p><p>Some people from Red Hat and Canonical are often a bit surprised or skeptical when I point out to them that binary licenses are also important. This whole saga is yet another data point, but it proves that yet again. If Red Hat had from the beginning released RHEL with free sources and unobfuscated patches,  then none of this would’ve been necessary in the first place. And while I wish Rocky Linux all the success it aims to achieve, I do not think that working for free on a system that ultimately supports Red Hat’s selfish eco-system is really productive or helpful.</p><p>The fact is, Debian is already a free enterprise-scale system already used by huge organisations like Google and many others, which has stable releases, LTS support and ELTS offerings from external organisations if someone really needs it. And while RHEL clones have come and gone through the years, Debian’s <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">mission and contract to its users</a> is something that stays consistent and I believe Debian and its ideals will be around for as long as people need Unixy operating systems to run anywhere (i.e.  a very long time).</p><p>While we sometimes fall short of some of our technical goals in Debian, and while we don’t always agree on everything, we do tend to make great long-term progress, and usually in the right direction. We’ve proved that our method of building a system together is sustainable, that we can do so reliably and timely and that we can collectively support it. From there on it can only get even better when we join forces and work together, because when either individuals or organisations contribute to Debian, they can use the end result for both private or commercial purposes without having to pay any fee or be encumbered by legal gotchas.</p><p>Don’t get caught by greedy corporate motivations that will result in you losing years of your life’s work for absolutely no good reason. Make your time and effort count and either contribute to Debian or give your employees time to do so on company time. Many already do and reap the rewards of this, and don’t look back.</p><p>While Debian is a very container and virtualization friendly system, we’ve managed to remain a good general-purpose operating system that manages to span use cases so vast that I’d have to use a blog post longer than this one just to cover them.</p><p>And while learning a whole new set of package build chain, package manager and new organisational culture and so on can be uhm, really rocky at the start, I’d say that it’s a good investment with Debian and unlikely to be time that you’ll ever felt was wasted. As Debian project leader, I’m personally available to help answer any questions that someone might have if they are interested in coming over to Debian. Feel free to mail leader_AT_debian.org (replace _AT_ with @) or find me on the oftc IRC network with the nick <em>highvoltage</em>. I believe that together, we can make Debian the <em>de facto</em> free enterprise system, and that it would be to the benefit of all its corporate users, instead of tilting <em>all</em> the benefit to just one or two corporations who certainly don’t have your best interests in mind.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Companies chasing DevOps have an internal team dedicated to automation. Developers use tools built by this team to run and operate their code. They have many names, but let’s call them Platform, which most companies do.</p><p>Platform teams create abstractions on top of the infrastructure. The goal is to increase developer speed and make systems reliable. They increase speed by simplifying infrastructure APIs and reliability by automating manual tasks. <strong>Automation lowers the risk of service disruptions, but companies aren’t automating the highest-risk tasks.</strong></p><p><strong>What should we automate?</strong></p><p>We used to ship software by accessing servers and running commands inside boxes to pull new code. Now code goes from Git to servers without human intervention. Developers define what they need with code. Platform teams build the tools to make code changes become running systems.</p><p>The goal is doing this for everything, from business code to infrastructure like networking, databases, and queues. But this is hard. Platform teams have a lengthy backlog; they focus on items demanded with higher frequency.</p><p>Developers make manual changes for things not yet automated. Some companies have compliance, regulations, and other constraints. <strong>It’s hard to get developers direct access to production. So they have the Platform team running these changes for developers.</strong></p><p>It’s what makes the higher frequency items get priority. Engineers want to write software, not run repetitive manual tasks. But this backlog is never decreasing. The business changes and adopts new technologies. Headcount grows, adding new items to the automation backlog. And this mysterious type of task is always left behind.</p><p><strong>One-offs.</strong></p><p>Sometimes a bug in software messes with a customers' money, time, health, or ego. They won’t wait for three iterations of code reviews, tests, code analysis, and gradual rollouts. It takes time. Someone will access the database and update it. These are one-off scripts. <strong>They solve a problem for one or a few customers before the team creates a definitive fix.</strong></p><p>One-off scripts have a terrible reputation. When this happens too much, it’s a sign that the software is not stable. In the ideal world, it would never happen. Engineers would spot such time-critical problems during the design and code review phases. Production issues should be light and wait for regular software delivery flow.</p><p>Almost every company lives under the illusion that one-offs should not exist. Or that they will stop happening at some point. Yes, one should not do this every day. <strong>But having a few senior engineers run manual scripts in production because it’s an exceptional case is a mistake.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Almost every company lives under the illusion that one-offs should not exist.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Am I doing one-offs?</strong></p><p>Here are some common one-off solutions companies use in production:</p><ul><li>Call Raketasks using Rails console.</li><li>Use IEx to call Elixir functions.</li><li>Exec into servers/containers/pods and make localhost calls to an HTTP API</li><li>Make DML queries against the database.</li><li>Run bash/Python scripts through VPNs.</li></ul><p><strong>A myth.</strong></p><p>One-offs won’t go away, and companies need to embrace it. Avoiding them will drive the company to the wrong path. Centralizing execution with experienced engineers; or creating a team dedicated to analyzing and running them isn’t reasonable. It’s the opposite of DevOps.</p><blockquote><p>One-offs won’t go away, and companies need to embrace it.</p></blockquote><p>Most big companies solve this problem with a slow and manual Change Management workflow. Developers find the problem and add a script to a ticketing system. <strong>Someone from the operations team runs it without all the context</strong> of what she is doing. Avoiding one-offs is the shortest path to this model.</p><p><strong>What about Runbooks?</strong></p><p>Runbooks are great. Tools like <a href="https://www.rundeck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rundeck</a>
and <a href="https://stackstorm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StackStorm</a>
automate fixing problems you know exist. They remove manual operations for routine tasks. But 1) creating Runbooks takes time, and 2) Runbook tools focus on infrastructure. One-off solutions need a faster track and application layer changes.</p><p>One-offs are the most challenging piece to automate. When you don’t know what problems will happen, it’s hard to build a solution upfront. Few companies I know 1) embrace one-offs, and 2) and try to automate them.</p><p><strong>For unknown unknowns, pre-existing solutions won’t work.</strong> The automation supporting this flow needs to be open-ended. The fastest is using direct access to resources and running ad-hoc solutions manually. But we can do better. It won’t get to the level of regular code, but we can get close.</p><blockquote><p>When you don’t know what problems will happen, it’s hard to build a solution upfront.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Isn’t this a bad incentive?</strong></p><p>A common misconception about one-offs is that formalizing them will increase their usage. They are faster to build than regular code. So it makes sense to think developers will prefer them over traditional pipelines. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. <strong>By making one-offs first-class citizens, you start to measure them. You can only change what you measure.</strong></p><p>One-offs must link to tasks with definitive fixes. Teams running them too much should decrease the number of features in the next sprint. Product prioritization should take into account what types of one-offs happen the most. All this is only possible with measurements. There is no upside in making one-offs hard to build and run.</p><blockquote><p>There is no upside in making one-offs hard to build and run.</p></blockquote><p><strong>One-offs as first-class citizens</strong></p><p>I built automations to support one-off scripts at previous jobs. It took a few months for the team as we had other duties, and the solution was not perfect. But <strong>developers were happy with the autonomy</strong> to build and run all solutions to their problems. Security and compliance were happier with audit trails &amp; logs. SREs were happy with fewer manual interventions in production. It was hard but paid off.</p><p>Today, I’m the founder of <a href="http://runops.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RunOps</a>
, a tool that automates one-offs. It lets you run scripts as if you had direct access to resources. Still, transparent controls and reviews make them safe, compliant, and reliable. It takes minutes to set up, our early users are very excited. Feel free to reach out on<a href="https://twitter.com/andriosrobert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Twitter</a>

<div><p>🌎 OpenNebula’s new <a href="https://opennebula.io/true-hybrid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</a> enables true hybrid and edge cloud computing by combining <strong>public and private</strong> cloud operations with <strong>workload portability</strong> and <strong>unified management</strong> of your IT infrastructure and applications.</p></div>



<div><p>Since the release of version 5.8 ‘Edge’ in February 2019, OpenNebula comes with a number of innovative features that provide organizations with a truly simple way to create and manage <strong>highly distributed cloud infrastructures</strong>. Thanks to these tools—developed in the context of our <a href="https://oneedge.io/">ONEedge</a> initiative—companies can easily deploy and manage remote clusters outside their premises in <strong>cloud and edge locations</strong> that are geographically dispersed or in close proximity to their end-users and customers.</p></div>
</div></div></div>



<p>By using <strong>OpenNebula’s new provisioning tools</strong>, cloud admins can now expand their private clouds in an incredibly flexible way using resources offered by <strong>third-party cloud providers like AWS and Equinix Metal</strong>, incorporating when necessary the distributed dedicated infrastructure they need to satisfy their users’ requirements for fault tolerance, capacity or low latency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>OpenNebula users can <strong>automatically allocate resources when needed</strong>, deploying and controlling edge nodes based on the current demand at those specific geographical locations. This approach simplifies significantly the process of <strong>provisioning and managing edge resources</strong>, without the organization that’s using this solution having to provide or own those underlying resources at all.</p>

<p>OpenNebula also offers a simple, but powerful approach for <a href="https://opennebula.io/mastering-containers/">running containerized applications and workflows</a>—both <strong>on-premises and on cloud or edge locations</strong>—by directly using Docker official images from the <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360046667892-Using-the-Docker-Hub-Marketplace-to-Deploy-Container-based-Applications">Docker Hub</a> and running them as lightweight <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/">Firecracker</a> microVMs. For those cases where Kubernetes is required or is the best fit, OpenNebula also provides a <a href="https://opennebula.io/certified-kubernetes-appliance/">Certified Kubernetes</a> Virtual Appliance available from the OpenNebula Public Marketplace, although for <strong>Kubernetes deployments at the edge</strong> we normally recommend a lighter solution based on <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a> clusters 😉</p>



<h2>The New AWS Wavelength Service</h2>



<p>Recently, Amazon Web Services (AWS), in collaboration with <strong>Verizon, Vodafone and other 5G telecommunication providers</strong>, has presented its new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/wavelength/">AWS Wavelength</a> service (read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-wavelength-zones-are-now-open-in-boston-san-francisco/">here</a> the full announcement by AWS Chief Evangelist Jeff Barr back in August). <strong>Wavelength Zones</strong> bring AWS compute and storage capabilities and services to the edge of existing 5G networks, embedding AWS hardware and software within their data centers. This enables developers to innovate and build a new class of edge applications that can exploit <strong>high bandwidth and ultra-low latencies</strong> as offered by the new 5G networks.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Thanks to AWS Wavelength, application traffic from 5G devices can reach the servers running in Wavelength Zones <strong>without leaving the telecommunications network</strong>, thus avoiding having to traverse multiple hops across the Internet to reach their final destination, as it happens with a traditional approach based on a centralized cloud solution. This new service enables both developers and end-users to finally take full advantage of the latency and bandwidth benefits offered by 5G networks 📱</p>



<p>At OpenNebula, we have already started <strong>testing the new AWS Wavelength resources</strong> as part of our <a href="https://oneedge.io/">ONEedge</a> initiative. Eventually, this new service will be incorporated into our <strong>catalogue of cloud and edge providers</strong> available for OpenNebula users. We expect this integration to really simplify the process of provisioning and managing resources close to 5G devices, helping organizations using OpenNebula to <strong>build and quickly deploy edge applications</strong> that can benefit from 5G high bandwidth and ultra-low latency, including machine learning, video streaming, multiplayer gaming, Internet of Things, augmented reality, and real-time analytics.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>OpenNebula’s First 5G Edge Architecture based on AWS Wavelength</h2>



<p>As part of our first tests of this new AWS service, we’ve adapted the scenario described by AWS Senior Developer Mike Coleman in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/deploying-your-first-5g-enabled-application-with-aws-wavelength/">post on AWS Wavelength</a> published in early August. In our case, a company with an OpenNebula private cloud wants to <strong>deploy a multi-container application at the edge</strong> (i.e a Machine Learning solution), closer to the 5G devices of their end-users. The following diagram describes how this would be implemented based on the features provided by OpenNebula and on the new resources made available by AWS Wavelength:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_Architecture-1024x563.png" alt="" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_Architecture-1024x563.png 1024w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_Architecture-300x165.png 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_Architecture-768x422.png 768w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_Architecture.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>AWS Wavelength is designed to provide access to services and applications that require low latency, but it’s important to remember that you don’t need to deploy your entire application in a Wavelength Zone. You only need to deploy those<strong> latency-sensitive parts of your application</strong> that are really going to benefit from being deployed at the 5G edge. In our demo scenario, the API server and inference engine are located on the Wavelength Zone because one of the design goals of the application is low-latency processing of the inference requests. On the other hand, given that the web server doesn’t have those latency requirements, it doesn’t really need to be hosted on the Wavelength Zone.</p>



<p>Each Wavelength Zone is <strong>associated with a specific AWS Region, known as the “parent region”</strong>. For our experiment we have picked the Boston area, which is one of the first regions—along with San Francisco—in which the new Wavelength service was made available. Also, Wavelength instances are only accessible from 5G devices on a specific telecom provider network, in this case from those of <strong>Verizon customers in the Boston area</strong> 🧱</p>







<figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_AWSportal-1024x189.png" alt="" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_AWSportal-1024x189.png 1024w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_AWSportal-300x55.png 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_AWSportal-768x142.png 768w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OpenNebula-Wavelength_AWSportal.png 1319w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>







<p>For the deployment of a multi-container application that benefits from this approach, we have used a number of <strong>well-known open source technologies</strong>. One of them has been <a href="https://k3s.io/">K3s</a>, a certified Kubernetes distribution originally developed by <strong>Rancher Labs</strong> and now hosted by the <a href="https://rancher.com/press/rancher-labs-k3s-joins-cloud-native-computing-foundation-sandbox-project">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF). K3s is a lightweight, production-grade distribution designed for organizations looking to run Kubernetes in resource-constrained environments, which makes it ideal for deployments at the edge. We have used a customized K3s image for this demo, but in the near future users will be able to deploy a K3s cluster by simply using its public Docker image 🤩</p>



<p>When <strong>bare-metal resources</strong> are available, OpenNebula users can also benefit from our latest, super-cool integration with <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/">Firecracker</a>. Firecracker is a new open source virtualization technology—widely used by AWS as part of its <strong>Fargate and Lambda</strong> services—especially designed for <strong>serverless deployments</strong>. By running application containers (e.g. the K3s Docker image) as a <strong>Firecracker microVM</strong>, we immediately obtain the enhanced security and workload isolation of a traditional VM, but without undermining the speed and resource efficiency of a container.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, right now, bare-metal instances are not available in the current Wavelength zones, so we cannot use Firecracker for our 5G edge deployment, only at the associated AWS parent region (i.e. us-east-1). Thus, for Wavelength instances, and thanks to another great feature of OpenNebula, we can use <strong>Ubuntu</strong>’s <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-opennebula/">LXD system containers</a> to deploy K3s agents on the Wavelength resources.</p>



<p>As show in the figure, in order to deploy a containerized application composed of different components, OpenNebula allows to <strong>instantiate a K3s cluster across multiple hosts with mixed hypervisors</strong> and then let the customer deploy the application (e.g. using an helm chart or kubectl) by scheduling the components on the right resources, typically deploying the latency-sensitive components (i.e. the Inference Engine and the API server) on the Wavelength Zone, and the rest of components (i.e. Web Server) on the AWS parent region.</p>



<h2>Integration of AWS Wavelength Resources within OpenNebula</h2>



<p>OK, let’s get into some more detail… 🤓 The first step required to set up AWS Wavelength resources is the deployment of an <strong>AWS Virtual Private Cloud</strong> (VPC) with two zones: one is related to the associated AWS parent region, and one is related to the Wavelength Zone. We have then to associate to the VPC an Internet Gateway that is used to assign public IPs to resources that are deployed within the parent region, plus a Carrier Gateway that is used to assign carrier public IPs to the resources deployed on the Wavelength Zone.</p>



<p>In the VPC we have to define two subnets: one for the resources at the parent region and one for Wavelength Zone resources. The parent region subnet will be associated with the Internet Gateway to get public IPs, whereas the Wavelength subnet will be associated with the Carrier Gateway to get public IPs from the 5G carrier network.</p>



<p>The Carrier Gateway in a Wavelength Zone only allows access from the carrier’s 5G network. So, since the Wavelength zone resources cannot be accessed by using the internet, it is not possible to provision, configure and set up those resources by directly accessing them. In order to integrate Wavelength Zone resources with OpenNebula, we have to <strong>use the parent zone’s servers as “bastion hosts”</strong> to access Wavelength Zone resources via SSH, since they are only reachable through the private VPC subnet. Resources in the parent region can also be used to deploy those parts of our application that are not latency-sensitive or require high-bandwidth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Provisioning resources on regular AWS zones for deploying application parts that are not latency-sensitive is already possible for OpenNebula and can be performed by using its standard <a href="https://docs.opennebula.io/5.8/advanced_components/ddc/overview.html">OneProvision</a> tool. By using a bastion host and customized SSH configuration files, it is then possible to <strong>provision and configure instances on the Wavelength Zone</strong> and to add them as hosts to the OpenNebula front-end. Since OpenNebula uses SSH to perform any operation on the hosts, once bastion and Wavelength resources are set up, it is possible to <strong>deploy containerized applications</strong> (i.e. a K3s cluster) both on the parent region and on the …</p></div></article></div></div>

I can sort of understand. When a company is bigger, there are more people and more things going on. More projects, more meetings, more presentations. Typing “Engaged User Growth Hack” becomes tedious the 14th time you write it in your proposal, so someone initialises it (EUGH) the first time and uses the acronym there on in. Once the document is circulated, it’s inevitable that at some point – it might take a few meetings, but eventually – it becomes common parlance. "How is the EUGH rate looking this week, Ted?"</p></div>
<div><p>One of the many problems you’re going to encounter in a growing business is a lack of clarity among staff. A successful business is one where employees understand things, and when they don’t it's okay because they know where to go to find the information required to understand things.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you’re a new hire reviewing an onboarding guide on your first day, or a seasoned employee reading the latest project proposal, you’re probably going to be faced with a sea of acronyms. The more there are, the more confused you'll be. This is bad for morale and bad for business, so it's your job as a leader in an organisation to spare everyone from this misery by eliminating acronyms as much as possible in your organisation. Here are my top tips.</p></div>


<div><p>Some acronyms are so universally understood and accepted that it would be weird not to use them (HTML, RAM). There are some acronyms where the majority of people know what they mean, even if they don't know specifically what the abbreviation stands for. There are some that are <strong>very dependent on context</strong> so proceed with caution unless they are truly universal or if you really know your specific audience. For instance:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>NHS. Everyone in Britain will know what this means, but many people from other countries might be confused.</li>
<li>FBI. You know what it is, but what does it stand for?&nbsp;</li>
<li>UFO. People of a certain age will know about UFOs, but has anyone talked about them since 1989?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<div><p>If we accept the premise that more acronyms means more confusion, why would we add to this? Writing Average Page Load Time is tedious for the author, but creates clarity and removes any confusion about what it means (given the appropriate context). APLT does neither. Adopting universal acronyms into your organisation isn't necessarily a bad thing, but inventing your own probably is.</p><p>One exception to this rule is code names. Calling your new internal app <strong>PERSI</strong> is better than calling it Predictive Enterprise Relationship System Integration, and it's fun to ask the team "How is PERSI doing this morning?". Personality goes a long way.<br>.</p></div>

<div><p>Even if we're not creating any new acronyms, there will always be a heap in common use already. When you’re writing a document, always write the words in full on first use and put the acronym in brackets after it. For example, don't write:</p></div>
<blockquote>In our company, we live and die by OKRs and KPIs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In our company, we live and die by Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).&nbsp;</blockquote>
<div>
<p>Given that everything is likely to be in digital form you should also, wherever possible, link to even more information. Context is king. So your document should look more like this:</p></div>
<blockquote>In our company, we live and die by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJB83EZtAjc">Objectives and Key Results</a> (OKRs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator">Key Performance Indicators</a> (KPIs).&nbsp;</blockquote>
<div>
<p>Do this always. Even if you think it's unnecessary, it's really not. It is helping communication, not hindering.</p></div>


<blockquote><em>To maximize clarity, use abbreviations sparingly<p>— American Psychological Association</p></em></blockquote>
<div>
<p>Just because everyone else does, you don't actually have to use acronyms yourself. You can assume everyone knows what KPI means, and perhaps they do know that it stands for Key Performance Indicator, but do they know what a "performance indicator" actually is? Wouldn't it be better to ditch the acronym entirely and say "measure of success"? You could say the same thing about OKRs (goals), CTR (ad click rate), and CRM (customer database). </p><p><a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/">Plain English</a> is liberating.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div><p>You need to write down all the acronyms being used in your daily business so, at the very least, people can look things up rather than sit there silently and fearfully in ignorance. Doing this is a fun company crowdsourcing exercise where you can talk about the perils of acronyms and get this front and centre so people actually know about it and use it.&nbsp;</p><p>This glossary should be reasonably short. If it's not, you're probably using too many acronyms in your business and you need to go on a diet. You could write an OKR for that.</p></div>
<div>
<p>The intention of this article is to make you think about how acronyms are being used in your business, and for you to keep a sharper eye on new ones appearing. You should feel empowered to question their invention, and you should call it out when a document lands in your inbox that is populated with unreferenced jargon. </p><p>You could even go all Elon Musk, <a href="https://gist.github.com/klaaspieter/12cd68f54bb71a3940eae5cdd4ea1764">berate the entire company</a> and demand sign-off of any new acronyms. Extreme behaviour, perhaps, but it goes to show the negative impact acronyms have on a business and the secret power of that liberating feeling of clarity when they're eliminated from use.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TTFN">TTFN</a>.<br><em><br>[1] I only learned this recently but an acronym is a word formed from the first letters of other words and is pronounceable, for example </em><strong><em>laser</em></strong><em> or </em><strong><em>radar</em></strong><em> (🤯 I know, right), whereas an initialism is an abbreviation in which each letter is pronounced separately, such as OMG or NHS. In this article I only use the word acronym because I'm pretty sure no-one ever uses the word initialism.</em></p></div>

So this is a tool specifically for deploying serverless apps, like <a href="https://stackery.io/">Stackery</a> or Amplify? Nope! I think the reason they’re advertising Proton as a solution for “containers and serverless” is that the two provided sample template bundles are for a Lambda CRUD app and a load-balanced Fargate service. But while building your own templates appears to be <em>frustrating, </em>there’s no technical <em>limit</em> on the sorts of apps Proton could help you deploy.</p><p>Proton itself is “serverless” only in the way CloudFormation is serverless: it’s a managed service. So is Proton a new and improved CloudFormation? No, it uses <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-sample-templates">CloudFormation templates all marked up with Jinja</a>, but it operates at a higher level than that.</p><p>It took a while to click for me, but Proton is not just another half-baked AWS developer tool. It’s doing something I don’t believe AWS has ever attempted before.</p><p>Proton’s innovation is that it builds <em>explicit assumptions about your organization</em> into its technical design.</p><p>Proton is <a href="https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal/status/1334321228694380544">Conway’s Law-as-a-Service</a>.</p><h2 id="h-proton-assumes-a-platform-team">Proton assumes a platform team</h2><p>I’ve spoken a lot over the years about the phenomenon (and, increasingly, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/08/07/cloud-bard-forrest-brazeal-pinpoints-failure-celebrates-success-cloud-native-evolution/">the pathologies</a>) of the central cloud team: the Terraform nerds at the center of a cloud-first org who create tools and standards for everybody else, particularly product developers. In your company, this team might be called the “platform team”, the “infrastructure team”, or just the “cloud team”. It’s a remarkably consistent pattern across larger orgs, even if it’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/why-central-cloud-teams-fail-and-how-to-save-yours">ultimately sub-optimal</a>.</p><p>In fact, the “one platform team supporting many product dev teams” pattern is so prevalent that AWS, in true customer-obsession mode, has now reasoned backwards from it to design Proton. Proton is a prescriptive way for platform teams to package up environments and infrastructure services, then toss them over the wall to development teams who will consume them. Proton draws the line between automation of infrastructure and development of application code exactly where your average enterprise does.</p><p>This means that if you do NOT have a central platform team and multiple dev teams — say, if you are a 10-person startup — <em>Proton is not for you, </em>at least not now, even if you have many Containers and Serverless Apps to deploy<em>. </em>Not for the reason many AWS services will not be for you — because they solve a technical problem you don’t have at a cost you can’t afford — but because Proton solves the app deployment problem in a way that is <em>incompatible with your organizational structure.</em></p><p>I really can’t think of another AWS service that is built this way. Even services like CodePipeline that ship AWS’s own organizational philosophy — I’m thinking of its reluctance to support branch-based workflows — do so implicitly and with workarounds. Proton is made for enterprise-shaped orgs. Period.</p><p>And that’s not a criticism! AWS absolutely should be releasing services designed with specific customer workflows in mind. Heck, I’ve <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/serverless-cicd-for-enterprise/">personally implemented</a> at least three bespoke versions of AWS Proton over the years, and so have many, many other people who’ve worked on central cloud teams. The hard part was always the separation of duties between what the central team should do and what the development teams should do, and how to get buy-in on that line of separation, wherever you end up drawing it. I even wrote up a janky Service Catalog-y solution in <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/pragmatic-enterprise-cicd">this 2019 piece</a>, which reads in retrospect like a cry for help.</p><p>Proton is <em>prescriptive</em> in the sense that it gives you a pre-baked pattern for coordinating application delivery, but <em>descriptive </em>in the sense that this pattern wasn’t dreamed up as an arbitrary “best practice” – it’s simply a canonization of what AWS sees customers already doing. In this way, it reminds me more of the reference architectures we often see open-sourced by AWS solutions architects and partners, rather than a typical top-level service.</p><h2 id="h-but-is-proton-a-good-idea">But is Proton a good idea?</h2><p>Proton’s been released in preview and is not fully baked yet, so I won’t offer specific technical nitpicks here, but I’d like to address a criticism that I’ve already heard quite a bit from central cloud teams: “Proton doesn’t simplify the process of creating deployment infrastructure nearly enough to be helpful!”</p><p>I justified my <a href="https://www.trek10.com/blog/pragmatic-enterprise-cicd">“pragmatic CI/CD design”</a> last year by pointing out that, while it involved complex templating, that complexity was distributed mostly where you’d want it: on the shoulders of the platform team. (Their job is YAML! They can deal with it!) Proton has made the same calculation, and drawn the lines of separation mostly in the same places. They are giving raw, somewhat labor-intensive controls to platform teams in order to present a streamlined deployment workflow to app dev teams, with all that nasty infrastructure abstracted away. (Maybe that’s a second reason Proton could be called “serverless?” No server automation for dev teams?)</p><p>Far from being too complicated, I worry that Proton may in fact be oversimplified. Because at the enterprise level, it’s well-nigh impossible to create deployment templates that are really general enough to work out of the box for a diverse portfolio of app teams. Sure, you’ll have a set of “happy path” teams that your templates support quite nicely. But then there are the edge cases, the teams that need services you don’t support or workflows you can’t accommodate. How do you keep them from dropping off into shadow IT … or worse, ballooning every template into an unusable mass of one million parameters?</p><p>These are teams who maybe <em>should </em>be building some of their own infrastructure, who should have less centralized dictation and more decentralized enablement. That’s the “Umbrella” pattern of org -&gt; CI/CD expression I called for earlier this year, <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cd-pipeline">in a blog that reads like lost minutes from a Proton design session</a>. It’s the pattern I’m seeing more and more forward-thinking organizations adopt – those who’ve run with the central cloud team long enough to realize its limits.</p><p><a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/why-central-cloud-teams-fail-and-how-to-save-yours">Central cloud teams are bottlenecks</a>, even if 80% of organizations haven’t matured enough to figure this out. And that leads to the most curious question of all: Will teams complex enough to <em>need </em>Proton eventually become too sophisticated to <em>use </em>Proton?</p><p>That remains to be seen, but I do hope that as Proton evolves, it will lead its customers toward sustainable best practices, instead of productizing the organizational mistakes of the past. Customer obsession is great, but as Andy Jassy said in last week’s keynote — sometimes you have to give them not what they ask for, but what they need.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Yesterday we launched <a href="https://typefully.app/">Typefully</a>, a write-only interface for Twitter, after weeks of work and refinement. I documented the whole story on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">@frankdilo</a>.</p>
<p>Not much deep work happened on launch day and for good reasons. It was a bigger launch than <a href="https://francescodilorenzo.com/mailbrew-launch-numbers">Mailbrew's</a>.</p>
<p>Here the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>16,400 Pageviews </li>
<li>1,432 Signups </li>
<li>1,843 Drafts created</li>
<li>256 Threads published</li>
<li>$155 Revenue (more on this at the end).</li>
</ul>
<p>The traffic breakdown reveals what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacker News: 6.3k</li>
<li>Twitter: 2.1k</li>
<li>ProductHunt: 1.9k</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, we finally managed to hit the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25358108">Hacker News frontpage</a>. </p>
<p>The perfect formula was:</p>
<ul>
<li>interesting product</li>
<li>no-bullshit title</li>
<li>sparking a controversial discussion in the comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to Twitter, we have been building a following there for some time, so it was a matter of publishing the <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo/status/1336589322670268416?s=21">right tweet</a>, at the right time, and getting the right people to retweet it.</p>
<p>For Product Hunt, we partnered with our friend <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina">Chris</a>. His followers got a notification when he hunted us, but we also did our part and emailed our lists.  That helped to get fast on the front page and to kickstart the discussion.</p>
<p>Once we were in front of enough people, the product did the rest.</p>
<p>Servers did hold up without a sweat. </p>
<p>It's crazy what you can do these days with a couple of well-configured dynos on Heroku and a Django app! We peaked at 8 RPS when we hit the HN frontpage.</p>
<p>Typefully was born as <a href="https://twitter.com/linuz90">Fabrizio</a>'s personal side-project. I jumped in to make the editor crazy-fast, and write the server-side code. When <a href="https://twitter.com/meseali">Ali</a> helped us refine positioning and copy, we knew we had a winner and promoted it to an official <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a> project.</p>
<p>Plans for the future? Implement all the great feature requests we got, and monetize this thing. </p>
<p>We launched with a tip-jar system where people could become <em>patrons</em> by tipping us, but with $150 earned after a crazy launch day like this, it's clear that this is not going to pay the bills. </p>
<p>We are thinking of adding some paid features. What's free is gonna stay free though, because this was first and foremost a labor of love.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Tomasz Tunguz <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/five-important-trends-data-one-megatrend-powering-them-tomasz-tunguz/">gave a presentation</a> on five trends in data and the “megatrend” that is powering them all.&nbsp;He makes the case (and we would agree) that the megatrend driving “changes in data design philosophy and tooling” is “the rise of the data engineer.”&nbsp;This blog discusses the history of data engineering megatrend over the past 20 years.</p>



<p>But how did we get here? The actual work of dealing with data has been around for a long time (think DBAs). Though as a unique discipline, data engineering is relatively new. Google Trends shows the term starting to pick up steam in 2016, and recently it has hit near peak popularity.&nbsp;</p>







 











<p>Engineers specialize as needs arise. Today, the data is available in surplus due to massive digitalization. Hence, there is a rapid growth in the need for data engineering and the related data infrastructure.  As a result, people and tooling are required to perform the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That rapid growth over the last 15-20 years, though, has created interesting dynamics within organizations and between teams that produce and consume data.&nbsp;</p>











<h2>A Brief History of Data Teams and Tooling&nbsp;</h2>

<h3>20 Years Ago: IT Owns Everything</h3>







<p>20 years ago, IT owned everything related to data tooling, and in most cases, the data itself. Teams outside IT used data in their work. However, dealing with the data and infrastructure wasn’t part of their workflow or responsibility. Teams like marketing, sales, etc., interacted with the data through systems like ERPs and Crystal Reports. This arrangement made sense then. There was a minimal crossover between the IT’s data and data tooling skillset, and other teams’ skillsets performing specific functions.&nbsp;</p>











<h3>2000 to 2010: The Beginning of the Schism Between IT and Other Teams</h3>







<p>By the end of the decade, though, the curve of mass digitization had begun to create demand for more data. Also, the use of that data across entire businesses increased. Further, we began to see a desire for <strong>access to</strong> and in many cases <strong>control over</strong> that data by non-IT teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lack of tooling, processes, and precedent to meet those desires marked the beginning of a schism between IT and other teams within the company. The classic example is marketing’s immense appetite for data, and IT’s seeming inability to satisfy that hunger with enough of the right data quickly. Despite other teams’ perception, IT was still innovating the future by building early pipeline infrastructure, leveraging in-memory databases, custom integrations, and early ETL solutions. However, the technology and cost still couldn’t keep up with demand. So, though still critical to the core business, IT began to be viewed as a rate-limiter for data-hungry teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Navigating the relationship between IT/engineering and other teams was (and, in many cases, is) hard—the book The Phoenix Project articulates this well. Some companies fared better than others, but even today, 10 years later, this schism’s impact is felt across industries.&nbsp;</p>











<h3>2010 to 2015: The Data Engineer is Born, and Everyone Gets Their Own Software</h3>







<p>The early to mid-2010s was an incredible time in the world of data as both IT and non-IT teams and the software companies that supported each responded to rapidly changing needs and digitization in general.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This innovation was primarily driven by the FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) and their pioneering use of customer data across disciplines, from marketing to product to data science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This period saw the birth and rise of significant data-focused technologies. Building on the foundations laid by technologies like Google’s Map Reduce and Hadoop, we saw the beginnings of RedShift and Snowflake, advanced data workflow tooling, and wider adoption of “the cloud”. (Remember when that was the new hot term?). Now commonplace, these tools were significant advances for IT/engineering as far as data flows and unification.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Even with those advances, though, the gap between IT/engineering and other teams, though, was still wide open. The FAANG companies had engineering resources to spend on building data products that serviced internal teams and/or buy expensive early solutions. But the companies trying to follow in their footsteps didn’t have the resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The software industry happily rose to the occasion and began to satisfy the needs of non-IT teams. Their cure came in two flavors: powerful all-in-one suites and point solutions. Both these flavors gave non-IT teams partial or full control over their data and tooling along with actual usage and activation of that data. (IT/engineering was capable of building for many of these use cases, and in many cases, they tried. However, the incredible amount of demand and changing nature of that demand proved to be a distraction from the more important role of building software and managing core data infrastructure needs.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>This boom in the software industry created the now-famous explosion of the “mar-tech” landscape, which grew from 150 tools to 5,000 by 2017 (and even more exponential growth in recent years). Software companies built both as comprehensive suites and best-of-breed point solutions, which we’ll come back to later in the post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These tools meant non-IT teams could move faster and create more value in their respective disciplines. However, as Tunguz points out, using more tools doesn’t mean all your problems are solved. The boom, in fact, created additional problems. These problems became universally and painfully apparent by around 2015. A few big problems were the creation of data silos and the rise in security concerns. Every team had their own data; however, in separate, third-party systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initial response to that pain came about with early data layer tooling like Segment and Snowplow. These tools disaggregated the data layer from software systems. Still, wide adoption didn’t begin until market-wide pain became acute, which also began to happen around 2015.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>2015 to 2020: The Rise of the Data Engineer and Data Tooling</h3>







<p>The wide availability of data created a demand for a new breed of analytics: self-serve analytics. The vision was compelling—enable any team to get any data they want, themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reality, though, wasn’t that simple. Data engineers had the ability to collect data into a flexible, centralized warehouse and layer on analytics tools. However, the actual process of collecting all of the data proved to be extremely difficult. Due to the proliferation of individual tools and datasets across multiple teams, centralized self-serve analytics remained a challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It turned out that the technological advances in both non-IT software and data tooling were literally industry-changing. However, these advances created a sort of <strong>crisis of integration</strong>.</p>



<p>Non-IT teams faced a similar problem. Having point solutions was great for individual teams. However, the inability of those tools to talk to each other was problematic. The classic example here is connecting the dots between marketing software and sales software (and don’t forget the warehouse!), which became a huge industry in and of itself.&nbsp;</p>











<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GXqP46WA6kLhs_joE4C2yfiEqQFdd7aMg5xhsQDuOV0TUQ1ZwcvjOw5FDJUEXXbv9eOV2GGqyRLHwclIpUB1oiftKVkJ7Zs2DHY6CkBeNaAbqtI8iXKqEN1N1uPIEhhI2-4iIhQ3" alt="Data silos and independent functioning" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LmgnwiZmK9SCE26Ni7wTYauBnkqYICrAEAweXyCraUvzfdlm61aDYcBc1PeHxst-bIn3p21ax7h5fwc-zNQxje7Ho27Skc4tpMyE6uvO9AatMABr2wjEK2UvtPomO7hf5Kvh0S2f" alt="Data interdependency across various teams" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure>











<p>These pain points forced teams and entire businesses to wrestle through the decision between disconnected “best of breed” tooling for individual teams and software “suites” that centralized everything but was far less advanced (think Salesforce Marketing Cloud vs. Salesforce + Marketo). Both pathways created problems for IT/engineering. Best-of-breed tools created more silos, but enterprise suites played by their own database rules and weren’t warehouse-friendly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As organizations wrestled with these problems, the discipline of data engineering was born (or re-born). Furthermore, the quest to unify and make use of all this data began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As expected, the industry for data tooling responded to these needs, and this period saw massive advancements in technology and adoption. Tools like Airflow, Spark, Kafka, and Segment simplified collecting, moving, and working with data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which brings us to today…</p>











<h2>2020 and Beyond&nbsp;</h2>











<p>Many of the trends mentioned above are still playing themselves out. The central theme is consistent, though. Empowering teams with the best tooling while maintaining a unified, flexible data layer has become a central technical and operational challenge for almost every business. Hence, data engineers are at the center of the action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The irony is that, in many ways, we’re back to where we started, where the skillsets needed to architect and operate data stacks that solve all of these problems reside in the IT/engineering discipline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Said another way, the data problem is, by nature, a technical problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the reason Tunguz points out that “data engineers are the change agents in a decade-long process that will revolutionize data.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most forward-thinking companies deprecate the schism between IT/engineering and other teams. Also, data engineers are valued as key partners for almost every team. They help create a competitive advantage. Thanks to incredible new data tooling, teams don’t have to make careful decisions about which tool to use. They can try any tool because data engineers have everything collected and connected at the data layer and in the warehouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next decade is a truly exciting time for data-driven companies. We’re excited to be building products for the developers at the center of the action.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>He sees you when you’re sleeping, he knows when your awake, he knows if you ‘we been bad or good so be good for goodness sake. This is a line of a popular Christmas song. It obviously refers to Santa Claus. However… What if this is true, not only for Santa, but for large companies worldwide. We’ll take a closer look on the data you give and the repercussions.</p>
</section><article><section><p>In today’s modern world, our phones are an integral part of our lives. We carry it everywhere, whether it is at work, when we are out and about or in the hospital. In every situation, our phone is nearby. The phone gives us easy access to information, communication and you might say there is an app for everything. If you need to see the local weather, it is right there in your phone, the same goes for the directions to the cinema or if you want to know what your friends are up to – check your phone. And it is all free of charge. Well, not exactly, nothing is free.</p>
<h2>The payment</h2>
<p>Although you might not spend any money on an app, the app still collect a form of payment from you. Your information is the currency and it is collected through every action you make on the internet and in the apps on your phone. Your device information, your likes and dislikes and your email is just some of the data they might collect. And the hottest commodity is your location data. You might say the phone is a tracking device you wear 24/7.</p>
<p>Some of this data, we give willingly. This can be photos, statuses, interests and in some cases, who your friends are, where you live and so on. It is easy to believe that the information you give to a specific app will be contained within the app. This is often not the case. Selling consumer data is a multi-billion-dollar industry and your data is sold for targeted marketing, to analytics companies and to research. </p>
<p>You might not know what you do online every day, but the 50 apps you have on your phone does and what you do says a lot about you.</p>
<h2>I have nothing to hide</h2>
<p>You might not know why you should care about the fact that your data is collected, you have nothing to hide. A couple of emails with “special offers” in terms of marketing might not be the worst thing. But here is why you should care. </p>
<p>There are no restrictions on who can by this data and more parties are showing interest. In fact, earlier this year the Wall Street Journal found that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-use-cellphone-location-data-for-immigration-enforcement-11581078600">U.S government bought commercially available location data</a> and used if for detecting undocumented immigrants or others trying to get across the U.S border. It also played a part in discovering a drug smuggling tunnel beneath the border between USA and Mexico in an abandoned KFC restaurant. </p>
<p>The police usually must acquire warrants to get this kind of information on your phone, but what if they can just buy it commercially? When is it ok to use these data and when is it surveillance? <a href="https://privacy-pc.com/interviews/bruce-schneier-nsa-is-wasteful-and-dangerous.html">Like the comparisons the cryptographer Bruce Sneider draws:</a> If the government said: “Whenever you make a new friend, you must inform the police”. We would laugh, but we willingly tell Facebook and Facebook informs the government. Or if the government says: ”Whenever you send a message or write a letter or send a note to somebody, send us a copy, please”. That would never happen, we would not do that. However, Google does it for you.</p>
<p>Throughout your days of using your phone or computer, you give pieces of information to each application or website, and although this data is supposed to be anonymous, it is not hard to connect the missing pieces. When seeing all the data from different sources together and by adding simple searches on specific information, your name and identity will be found and the data will no longer be anonymous. This was illustrated when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html">The New York Times</a> bought commercially sold location data. With this data they could easily find the person to whom the data belonged. Even though the name of the woman they were tracking, was not among the bought information, they deduced a lot about her. They could see that she was at a weight watchers meeting, doing a procedure at the dermatologist and by the amount of time she was spending at a school, she was most likely a teacher. The phone tracked her every two seconds and giving information about her she found disturbing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nrk.no/norge/xl/avslort-av-mobilen-1.14911685">NRK</a>, a TV-channel in Norway did the same. By analysing the person’s patterns, they could see where he spent his days and where he spent his nights. By this information alone one can easily find out who lives at the address he slept at and who works at the address he was during the day, to find the name of the person using the phone. They even found that the person was going to interviews with another company, which he had not told anyone. And some time after these interviews he change his place of work.</p>
<p>All your data collected is a foundation for through analysis of you as a person. They can put you in boxes and make assumptions about you. Sometimes they are right, and sometimes they are not. If you are classified as likely to become a gambler, could it get in the way of you getting a loan in the future? Or could marketing pray on your weaknesses to get you to buy something you don’t need? You can easily be manipulated by companies gaining in-depth knowledge about you. This was proven by “Folkeopplysningen”, a show in Norway that informs the public about different topics. In one episode they <a href="https://www.nrk.no/dokumentar/xl/ble-manipulert-etter-nrk-spionering-pa-hans-digitale-liv-1.14759796">manipulate an intelligent man to give up his company, his life’s work, purely based off of information found on him online</a>. By his likes on Facebook, they could perform a personality test. By the pictures on Instagram they could see that he liked to work out, that he loved superheroes and all kind of other information. They staged a day for him to be considered for a super hero-part in a Hollywood production. All he had to do was give up his business. This is something he probably would never do if it wasn't for being manipulated for an entire day based on the information the TV-show could find on his social media and other online accounts.</p>
<h2>What about GDPR</h2>
<p>If you live in Europe, you have probably heard of General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr.asp">GDPR</a>&nbsp;is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from people who live in the EU. It is there to give consumers of the internet more right as to what data is collected.</p>
<p>As a consumer, you notice it best by having to accept the use of cookies on the web or by giving permissions to the apps of which data they can have access to. However, the government can only do so much if consumers keep accepting the usage. The web or phone applications often make it hard not to accept by writing the terms incomprehensible or too long. In some cases, you must even go to completely different applications to turn it all the way off.&nbsp;<em>As long as it is easier to accept, we will accept.</em>&nbsp;It can also be difficult to investigate where the commercially sold data comes from because not all companies are located in Europe and in some cases the terms does not specify all the different ways your data can be spread. </p>
<h2>Off the grid</h2>
<p>By highlighting some downsides of sharing data, you might feel the need to stop sharing data all together, but it is important to state that data sharing is not all bad. First of all, getting commercials tailored for you can be a good thing as you can get offers based off of previous purchases and get more effective services. Another great thing about sharing your data is that it can benefit scientists. Research on cancer be done studying patient data, why we are the way we are can be explored by looking at data from Facebook and so on. Looking at large sets of data can give us a better understanding of the world today.</p>
<p>The thing to think about is that you do not have to share your data all the time and to every app or website. For instance, a flashlight app does not need permissions to track your location. There are ways of sharing less data by limiting the apps on your phone to only sharing location data when the app is used or turning it completely of when you are not active on your phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it is all said and done it is&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;data.</p></section></article></div>]]>

December 10, 2020 | https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/12/09/xkit-and-fusionauth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/12/09/xkit-and-fusionauth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>FusionAuth and Xkit came together for this blog post to share how you can use our services to boost your engineering team’s productivity. If you’re working on growing your SaaS business, you know just how much your engineers have on their plates. At both FusionAuth and Xkit, we believe that outsourcing what you can – like authentication and integration infrastructure – lets your team focus on the products and services that drive your business.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We’ve written this post to lay out how you can use our services together to simplify your auth and build native integrations into your app faster. No more telling your customers that the integrations they’ve been asking for are “on the roadmap”. Follow the steps below and you can ship them in no time.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-xkit">What is Xkit</h2>

<p>Xkit is a SaaS platform which makes integrating third party systems a snap. Suppose you are writing a recipe management application and are going to sell it for big money to all the cooks of the world. After some market research, you realize that you want to integrate with other services. Your users are clamoring for the ability to export the steps of a recipe to a Trello board for sharing and Dropbox for backups. These are all services with APIs.</p>

<p>End users can give your application access to their accounts with these services, but that takes some coding. There’s also a fair bit of hoop jumping: setting up API keys and OAuth consent screens, among other things.</p>

<p>This is the problem which Xkit solves. Xkit has built connections to many services; <a href="https://docs.xkit.co/docs/connecting-with-apps-overview">here’s a current list</a>. Once configured, your application can connect a user’s account with an external service to your application. I (Dan) was able to connect Trello and my app in about an hour. The user experience of connecting the external application is smooth and far better than something I could whip up in a day, let alone an hour.</p>

<h2 id="xkit-and-fusionauth-integration">Xkit and FusionAuth integration</h2>

<h3 id="install-fusionauth">Install FusionAuth</h3>

<p>FusionAuth offers <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/">a number of different methods you can use to install the service</a>. Once you’ve installed it, there’s a Setup Wizard to walk you through the next steps. You’ll need to create your application in the FusionAuth interface and then add a few elements to your application code base to fully implement the FusionAuth login flow. A <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide/">full, detailed setup guide</a> is also available. Feel free to create additional <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/users/">users via the FusionAuth administrative user interface</a>.</p>

<p>Once FusionAuth is installed and configured, you have a full featured user management system, ready to go. APIs to control everything, multi factor authentication, consent management, SAML, OIDC, and more, hosted wherever you want. There’s also FusionAuth Cloud, a managed services offering, if you don’t want to host FusionAuth yourself.</p>

<h3 id="install-xkit">Install Xkit</h3>

<p>After you’re set up with FusionAuth you’ll want to head over and <a href="https://app.xkit.co/sign-up">create your Xkit account</a>. Upon sign-up, Xkit will also prompt you with some basic information needed to set up the environment. Fill out those details and you’re good to go there.</p>

<p>To set up Xkit in your code base, you’ll need to add the script tag for <code>xkit.js</code> on your front-end:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"https://&lt;your-slug&gt;.xkit.co/xkit.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition, your users need a place to actually sign in to their apps, such as Dropbox for your cooking recipe sharers. The easiest way to do this is to direct users to the hosted integration catalog Xkit has set up for you:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://&lt;your-slug&gt;.xkit.co"</span><span>&gt;</span>Integration Catalog<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Alternatively, if you need more customization, you can embed Xkit’s catalog on your site and customize its styling to fit your look and feel (<a href="https://docs.xkit.co/docs/self-hosted-catalog">details here</a>). If you still need more flexibility, you can use the SDK.</p>

<h3 id="connect-fusionauth-with-xkit">Connect FusionAuth with Xkit</h3>

<p>Now that you have both FusionAuth and Xkit set up, you’ll need to connect the two. We do this by collecting some information from your FusionAuth dashboard and inputting it into Xkit.</p>

<p>Specifically, you’ll need to generate an RSA key and then add your “iss” claim, “aud” claim and JWKS URL into your Xkit account. This setup is <a href="https://docs.xkit.co/docs/fusionauth">fully documented</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/xkit-fusionauth-integration/rsa-keypair.png" alt="The generated RSA key for use with Xkit."></p>

<p>Once you’ve done that and clicked save, FusionAuth and Xkit will be connected. Huzzah!</p>

<p>You can now have your users log in using FusionAuth’s Login API. You’ll get a JWT from FusionAuth on successful user authentication. This JWT can then be sent to Xkit to authenticate the user in Xkit, and therefore grant them access to integrations you’ve configured.</p>

<p>In your code base you can log your user into Xkit simply by using your FusionAuth ID token:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>xkit</span><span>.</span><span>ready</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>xkit</span><span>.</span><span>login</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>eyJhbGciOi...</span><span>'</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This easy JWT-based connection saves you the trouble of dealing with API keys and provisioning users for Xkit; you can instead maintain them in FusionAuth. You can also use FusionAuth for all your other applications, providing one view of all your users.</p>

<p>The security minded among you will notice that this JWT is available in the DOM, and therefore exposed to cross site scripting attacks, should any malicious JavaScript be executed on the same page. To minimize the risks, lock the permissions associated with this JWT down and don’t allow its use as a bearer token for any other more sensitive APIs or services.</p>

<h2 id="add-an-integration">Add an integration</h2>

<p>Now to actually set up your first integration! Say you want your users to be able to connect their Trello accounts with your app. To do this, you’ll first need to get an <a href="https://trello.com/app-key">Trello API key</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/xkit-fusionauth-integration/xkit-trello-screenshot.png" alt="The Xkit Trello integration screen."></p>

<p>Next you’ll need to add Trello as a connector in your Xkit platform and provide Xkit with the API key. After filling out a bit more information in the Xkit Trello connector page to set the permissions you require and what your users see when they’re connecting the app, you’ll click save.</p>

<p>You’re now ready to retrieve access tokens! You simply make one API call to retrieve a user’s fresh access token:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>trelloToken</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>xkit</span><span>.</span><span>getConnectionToken</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>trello</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the token isn’t available, you should send the user to the appropriate place in your integration catalog to connect it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//...</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>trelloToken</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>window</span><span>.</span><span>location</span><span>.</span><span>href</span> <span>=</span> <span>xkit</span><span>.</span><span>connectorUrl</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>trello</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>//...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Behind the scenes here, Xkit handles all the complicated parts of managing the access tokens — dealing with each SaaS app’s protocol differences, token expirations, refresh tokens, protection against CSRF attacks, token encryption and more — so that it’s as simple as one API call for you. This setup also makes it easy to retrieve the token anywhere in your stack, be it in Cloud Functions, on the front-end, from your web server, etc. You can then use the token to make calls to the Trello API.</p>

<p>To add integrations to other apps, you follow essentially the same steps and retrieve the token with the same API call. Specific guides for different apps <a href="https://docs.xkit.co/docs/connecting-with-apps-overview">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>We’re always looking for feedback and suggestions so let us know your thoughts! Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>This post can also be found on the <a href="https://xkit.co/post/adding-native-integrations-to-your-app-with-xkit-and-fusionauth">Xkit blog</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Top React libraries you need to know in 2021]]>

December 10, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/react-libs-2021/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/react-libs-2021/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last time we looked a bit at the background and some built-in features of React. As promised it’s now time to look at some optional tools. Just like with Vue and Angular, components play a big role here and as usual you can create your own or use some of those made by the rapidly growing community. Let’s take a look at React libraries you should check before 2020 ends.</p>
<h2>React based frameworks</h2>
<p>If you’re planning on working with React most likely you’re going to have to pick between two starter frameworks, Gatsby.js and Next.js. React by itself works only on the client side and does not provide server side rendering, while those two build on top of React and provide SSR/SSG. Both also follow JAMStack architecture and provide you with a boilerplate which helps speed up and simplify the development process. That’s enough about similarities and let’s look at what the choice boils down to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby.js</a>:</strong> generates HTML via server side generator during the build time, this means you don’t need a Node.js server to handle rendering and you’ll have HTML files ready right after build.  Data fetching is handled via GraphQL which has its benefits (you only fetch what you need which saves resources and time) but also ties you to GraphQL which not everyone likes or wants to use. Prominent uses of Gatsby.js include Figma.com, React’s official site and State of Javascript.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>:</strong> renders pages via server side rendering, this requires a Node.js server to run applications and handle dynamic HTML rendering. If you don’t like that Next.js also supports SSG since version 9.3. What you use for data fetching is up to you, hell you can even use GraphQL. Prominent uses of Next.js include TikTok, Hulu and Twitch mobile.</li>

<h2>State management</h2>
<p>State management is the most crucial part of any modern React app. Most of the time it is the biggest challenge any developer faces while working on their frontend project, especially when it comes to large and complex enterprise-grade commercial apps. Managing state is such a complex task that proper handling requires using external libraries, as at some point React itself will no longer be able to provide a satisfactory solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>:</strong> a predictable, standalone state container for JavaScript apps which helps you write applications that behave consistently and run in different environments. Being a standalone library means you can use Redux even if you don’t have a UI setup yet. Redux can be used with any UI framework i.e React, where you can describe your UI as a function of your state and make Redux keep track of your components state and update them accordingly in response to UI actions. Redux is definitely the most popular choice when it comes to state management with React with almost 5 million weekly downloads on NPM.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://mobx.js.org/README.html">MobX</a>:</strong> a simple, scalable state management solution. It’s easier to learn and simpler to use than Redux and focuses on helping develop simpler apps with less boilerplate code. The main focus is reducing the number of bugs by mapping the relations between state and derivatives while maintaining referential integrity. Another plus is that it can be used either client side or server side and, as a JavaScript library, lets you keep the existing utilities of JS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Forms</h2>
<p>Forms are present in most web and mobile apps.  Unlike Angular and Vue, which both give you a way to validate forms out of the box, React requires you to handle them all by yourself. Fortunately there are some libraries rushing to help you out.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://formik.org/">Formik</a>:</strong> is the most popular form library for React (and React Native). Formik is packed with dozens of micro features like different types of validation, handling API errors, auto-saving forms data and many more. It’s the result of the React community’s years of experience in terms of UI, security, accessibility etc. With Formik you can focus on developing your product instead of battling with all aspects of forms. It’s a well-tested and highly optimized solution, using which will leave you with less chances for unexpected errors and edge cases in your forms.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Forms</a>:</strong>  a light-weight form library for React, allowing you to achieve astonishing results with a minimal amount of code, which makes it very performance oriented. React Hook Forms is optimized to remove any unnecessary re-renders of your components by providing the developer a way to isolate component re-renders, improving performance of your mobile or web application. It is a great way to empower your applications with highly-performant, flexible, easy to use and manage forms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is now one of the leading approaches to application development. It’s becoming more and more popular as it reduces the chance of major bugs occurring in the future. An obvious downside of test-driven development is that it usually takes longer to bring a product to market than while using a behavior-driven development approach. Fortunately there are some useful React libraries that can make writing tests a much easier task.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/">Enzyme</a>:</strong> a JS testing utility that makes testing your React components super easy. You can manipulate, traverse and in some ways simulate runtime given the output. Enzyme was created internally at AirBnB and released as an open source project in 2015. The tool aims to be as easy as possible by providing an intuitive API inspired by jQuery’s API for DOM manipulation and traversal.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/">React Testing Library</a>:</strong> a tool that lets you test React components without relying on their implementation details. This approach helps focus on accessibility as it basically puts you in the shoes of the end-user of the React app. The guiding principle here is that the more your tests look like the way your software is supposed to be used, the more confidence running them can give you. It’s much lighter and easier to get started with than Enzyme (which on the other hand has a lot more functions) and is the recommended testing app according to React’s docs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>UI</h2>
<p>If it goes for out of the box React components there’s a bunch of useful libraries made by the community to check out. Using these can help you in a variety of ways by providing practical and reusable solutions, which really impact the time and effort development takes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a>:</strong> a UI kit which replaces Bootstrap’s JavaScript with React code. Arguably the best way to quickly start building UI as it has thousands of ready to use themes and resources. No wonder it’s among the most popular component libraries with over 700k weekly downloads on NPM.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a>:</strong> a set of components created by Google based on their famous material design protocols. The components are self-sustaining in nature and only inject the styles they need to display. It also provides a lot of accessible and configurable UI widgets and ready to use site templates. This makes for a pretty significant performance boost especially considering the library is regularly updated and has very strong community support with over 60k stars on GitHub and is probably the most popular component library with over 1,6 mln weekly downloads on NPM.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://rebassjs.org/">Rebass</a>:</strong> a tiny component library that packs a punch. Rebass contains only 8 components and weighs only 4 KBs but can be used to create a robust set of themable UI elements. It’s based on the Styled System library and focuses on providing a quick start for your development process. It’s really handy if you don’t want to rely too much on community component libraries or you intend to create your own custom UI.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI React</a>:</strong> the official React integration for Semantic UI. This offers all the extra functions of the jQuery based re-scripted in React code. Comes with tons of prebuilt components designed specifically to make it easier to work with and produce Semantic-friendly code.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://ant.design/">Ant Design</a>:</strong> a design system for enterprise level products. Based on the Ant Design project it provides you with over 60 high quality components crafted based on a design language developed by the creators. The components are customizable and include support for dozens of languages. The focus is on helping build rich, interactive UIs for internal desktop applications (no worries there’s also Ant Design Mobile for mobile apps)</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've all had conversations that were <em>painfully</em> forced and awkward. After they’re over, you beat yourself up over how the other person probably doesn’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>But why should you care about being likeable?</strong> It’s a valid question. In reality, this isn’t just a vanity metric or something to make you feel good. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/careers/leadership/article-why-likeability-gets-you-hired-and-promoted/">Likeable people make more money, live longer, have more opportunities, and have more success in their love lives.</a>. Everything has to do with human relationships at a certain point, so it’s really worth investing some effort in improving your likeability.</p>
<p>You’ve probably met someone who impressed you with their charisma. It’s easy to think that likeability is an innate thing - something you’re born with. What you don’t see though, is that person is actually trying hard to make you enjoy your interaction with them.</p>
<p><em>There are specific steps you can take to be more likeable when you’re interacting with someone new.</em> The crazy thing about these techniques is that even if the other person knows you are doing them intentionally, they will still end up liking you more. It’s simple human biology, people want to feel important and like they have been heard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this post, we'll go over tips to make anyone like you more. It'll include word for word templates and high level approaches you can take to be the most popular person in the room.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="get-their-guard-down-with-an-early-compliment"><a href="#get-their-guard-down-with-an-early-compliment" aria-label="get their guard down with an early compliment permalink"></a>Get their guard down with an early compliment</h2>
<p>First impressions matter and the first few seconds are critical. Start the conversation with a positive vibe by hitting the other person with a quick and casual compliment.
Don’t worry - they won’t see you as a suck up if you can keep the praise small and specific. This should be an authentic compliment though. Don’t lie. Everyone has some positive attributes so make an effort to identify one.</p>
<p>Focus on the following as potential areas to compliment:</p>
<h5 id="➤-their-work"><a href="#%E2%9E%A4-their-work" aria-label="➤ their work permalink"></a>➤ Their Work</h5>
<p>Every person wants to be recognized for the thing that they spend the majority of their time doing - work.</p>
<p><strong>How To Say It:</strong> <em>"I'm a really big fan of your work so this is an honor"</em></p>
<h5 id="➤-their-vibe-energy"><a href="#%E2%9E%A4-their-vibe-energy" aria-label="➤ their vibe energy permalink"></a>➤ Their Vibe (Energy)</h5>
<p>People don’t usually hear compliments about their energy so this one will stand out in their minds</p>
<p><strong>How To Say It:</strong> <em>“You’re doing awesome stuff all the time. It's such an infectious spirit”</em></p>
<h5 id="➤-platonic-physical-compliment"><a href="#%E2%9E%A4-platonic-physical-compliment" aria-label="➤ platonic physical compliment permalink"></a>➤ Platonic Physical Compliment</h5>
<p>Harder to get right since there is a thin line between nice and weird. Definitely don’t be sexual or point out something the other person may not want attention drawn to. Generally anything they are wearing prominently and proudly is fair game.</p>
<p><strong>How To Say It:</strong> <em>"Congratulations on the mustache"</em></p>
<p>Here’s the key to executing the compliment successfully: don’t dwell on it. It is important to transition off the compliment fairly quickly. You’ve made the other person feel impressive - now they should want to live up to that positive image you have created for them!</p>
<h2 id="ping-for-topics-of-mutual-interest"><a href="#ping-for-topics-of-mutual-interest" aria-label="ping for topics of mutual interest permalink"></a>Ping for topics of mutual interest</h2>
<p>Think about the interactions that you enjoy the most. Usually it is when you’re talking about something that you are interested in or passionate about. In order to be more likeable, try to find a subject that the other person has some passion for. Ideally you are also interested in that thing - at least enough to be able to talk about it.</p>
<p>Use whatever you may know about the person’s background or skills to try to identify something that makes them open up. Bring up strange and quirky topics that may be something the other person has knowledge on. The best case is this starts an entire new segment of engaged conversation. The worst case is that you are memorable and it gives you an opportunity to explain your weirdness. Being boring and forgettable is way worse than being odd as long as people feel good around you.</p>
<p>Your first guess might not be right so keep trying to “ping” different topics by lightly mentioning them. When you’ve found something that resonates, the other person will dive in eagerly. From there, it’s just a matter of letting them drive the conversation to the part of that topic that is most interesting to them.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-other-person-excited-about-the-conversation"><a href="#get-the-other-person-excited-about-the-conversation" aria-label="get the other person excited about the conversation permalink"></a>Get the other person excited about the conversation</h2>
<p>So far, this advice has been pretty basic. Nothing earth shattering. Compliment people and find what they’re interested in - so what? Let’s get a level deeper.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll want to ask <strong>“why"</strong> questions that drive people to talk about what they really <strong>VALUE</strong>. Here’s the playbook:</p>
<p>➤ Instead of just: "Where are you from?" try → "Why do you live there?".</p>
<p>➤ Instead of just: “What do you do for work?” which is kind of boring, ask → “why did you decide to do that?” which is very interesting and open ended.</p>
<p>This can be done in two phases. The “what” phase is the basic introductory question. The “why” goes into their thought process and values as a follow up.</p>
<p>Even if the person doesn't love their own answer, they'll get to explain what is important to them. Now we’re getting somewhere juicy. People are much more likely to want to talk about what they value.</p>
<p><strong>Try to ask questions that are fun to answer.</strong> If you feel like someone doesn't have anything interesting to talk about, get them past the block by asking them something that removes the constraint of having to be realistic. Suspending reality temporarily for that person will make them enjoy the time they spent talking to you more because you indulge their fantasies. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone thinks they should be richer, more powerful, and more popular - let them feel that way for a few minutes and I guarantee they’ll like you more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of great fantasy-enabling questions might go like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>If you had a magic wand and the incredible ability to do whatever you want in this situation, what would you do?</em></li>
<li><em>If you had 100 million dollars, what would you do instead?</em></li>
<li><em>Let's say you're the king of the world &amp; we said "what are we gonna do?"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>One great decision tree of questions could be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are you doing currently?</em></li>
<li><em>Do you enjoy it?</em></li>
<li>If yes: ask <em>"why"</em> and elicit their values</li>
<li>If no: ask <em>"if you had $100M what would you do instead?”</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-a-connection-by-actively-listening"><a href="#create-a-connection-by-actively-listening" aria-label="create a connection by actively listening permalink"></a>Create a connection by actively listening</h2>
<p>You want to set the other person up to feel like a rock star. This is pretty easy once you’ve found a topic that they are passionate about.</p>
<p><strong>If you laugh easily, you will be more fun to talk to.</strong> It makes the other person feel good for being funny even when they aren't trying to be. Find humor in the absurd and watch the other person light up. Don't fake laugh though! Instead just allow yourself to laugh every time you find something funny. Look for opportunities to enjoy what the other person is saying. Laughing is a habit - it is easier the more you do it. Maybe watch something funny right before the conversation to get yourself in a laughing mood.</p>
<p><strong>Use mirroring.</strong> This means subtly copying people words, actions, and mannerisms. People like those who are like them. Repeat the last couple of words that someone says to you or a selected phrase they've used that stands out. People love hearing their own words. You want the other person to feel heard and important. Mirror to build rapport before taking control of the conversation if you have a desired outcome. It’s important to not copy everything about them though, have your own style. Stay true to yourself and have confidence in who you are.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-comfortable-and-relaxed-style"><a href="#have-a-comfortable-and-relaxed-style" aria-label="have a comfortable and relaxed style permalink"></a>Have a comfortable and relaxed style</h2>
<p>One final quick tip is to stay loose and be relaxed. Lean back in your chair even when you're in a position where you want to win someone else over. By doing so, you’re subconsciously signalling that they need to work for your attention. It flips the dynamic of the conversation and will cause them to double down on trying to win you over. When they do so, it’ll reinforce in their mind that they like you - because why else would they try so hard?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary, use the 5 approaches below in your next conversation and see how they work for you!</p>

    <p>Apple sure like to change things, so when my new computer shipped with the new macOS 11.0, some things didn't work - specifically the Haskell compiler, GHC, failed linking my programs with OpenGL and other system libraries.</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/18446">The problem</a> is already fixed in the GHC git repository, and I could try building it, but that might send me on new adventures due to more new-version behaviours, so instead I looked into working around the problem by making macOS 11 behave like macOS 10 did in the way that GHC expects!</p>
<h3 id="short-problem-description">Short problem description</h3>
<p>When linking with OpenGL, GHC verifies that the file <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/OpenGL</code> exists, but it no longer does!</p>
<p>We can't add the file there (not even with <code>sudo</code>) because macOS's <code>/System</code> folder is special.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>We can trick GHC to believe that the file exist, and then everything would work!</p>
<p>This can be done by hijacking its calls to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stat_(system_call)"><code>stat</code></a> system call and returning fake results.</p>
<p>MacOS lets us inject additional code into programs using the <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> environment variable, and it also supports special pragmas to tell it to replace library functions (aka "interpose" or "hook").</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>int</span> my_stat (<span>const</span> <span>char</span>* <span>restrict</span> path, <span>struct</span> stat* <span>restrict</span> buf)</span>
<span id="cb1-2">{</span>
<span id="cb1-3">    <span>if</span> (STARTS_WITH (<span>"/System/Library/Frameworks/"</span>, path))</span>
<span id="cb1-4">    {</span>
<span id="cb1-5">        <span>// Pretend that the file exists</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span>
<span id="cb1-8">    <span>return</span> stat (path, buf);</span>
<span id="cb1-9">}</span>
<span id="cb1-10"></span>
<span id="cb1-11">DYLD_INTERPOSE (my_stat, stat)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above injected code tricks GHC to believe that any file inside <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/</code> exists, and that makes it work!</p>
<p>To work around the problem when executing <code>ghc</code> from a build system, it takes a bit more work to make sure that the injection propagates to it, but my complete solution isn't too long, see: <a href="https://github.com/yairchu/macos11-haskell-workaround/">github.com/yairchu/macos11-haskell-workaround</a></p>

<li>I want to get this workaround into the Haskell build tool <code>stack</code>, if you want that too then please share your opinion on <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5456">the issue</a>!</li>
<li>FYI: The Linux equivalent of <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> is called <a href="https://tbrindus.ca/correct-ld-preload-hooking-libc/"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code></a>, and it can do similar things on Linux.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><img src="http://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/extreme-weather.png" alt="" width="700" height="508" srcset="https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/extreme-weather.png 700w, https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/extreme-weather-300x218.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></p>
<p>Modelling extreme events in order to evaluate and mitigate their risk is a fundamental goal in many areas, including extreme weather events, financial crashes, and unexpectedly high demand for online services. In order to mitigate such risk it is vital to be able to generate a wide range of extreme, and realistic, scenarios. Researchers from the National University of Singapore and IIT Bombay have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08454">developed an approach</a> to do just that.<span id="more-3776"></span>  </p>
<p>In work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08454">recently posted on arXiv</a> Siddharth Bhatia, Arjit Jain, and Bryan Hooi, note that in many applications, stress-testing is an important tool. This typically involves testing a system on a wide range of extreme but realistic scenarios to check that the system can cope in such situations. </p>
<p>Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their variants have received tremendous interest, due to their ability to generate highly realistic samples. However, existing GAN-based methods tend to generate typical samples, i.e. samples that are similar to those drawn from the bulk of the distribution.  In this work, the authors seek to design deep learning-based models that can generate samples that are realistic and extreme. Their aim is to devise a method that would allow domain experts to generate extreme samples for their desired application.</p>
<p>Bhatia, Jain and Hooi express the problem more formally as follows: “Given a data distribution and a criterion to measure extremeness of any sample in this data, can we generate a diverse set of realistic samples with any given extremeness probability?” An example is shown in the figure below. Here, they are interested in flood resilience, so choose to measure extremeness based on total rainfall. Generating extreme samples would mean generating rainfall scenarios with spatially realistic patterns that resemble rainfall patterns in actual floods (right side of Figure 1) which could be used for testing the resilience of a city’s flood planning infrastructure.</p>
<figure><img src="http://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Figure.png" alt="Extreme weather data" width="1552" height="674" srcset="https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Figure.png 1552w, https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Figure-300x130.png 300w, https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Figure-1024x445.png 1024w, https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Figure-768x334.png 768w, https://aihub.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Figure-1536x667.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px"><figcaption>Figure 1: The goal of this work is to generate samples which are both realistic and extreme, based on any user-specified extremeness criteria (in this case, high total rainfall). Left: Existing GAN-based approaches generate typical rainfall patterns, which have low (green) to moderate (red) rainfall. Right: Extreme samples generated by ExGAN have extreme (violet) rainfall, and realistic spatial patterns resembling that of real floods.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To model extremeness the authors draw on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory">Extreme Value Theory</a> (EVT), a probabilistic framework designed for modelling the extreme tails of distributions. However, there are two additional aspects to this problem which make it challenging. The first issue is the lack of training examples: in a moderately sized dataset, the rarity of “extreme” samples means that it is typically infeasible to train a generative model only on these extreme samples. The second issue is that we need to generate extreme samples at any given, user-specified extremeness probability.</p>
<p>The authors’ new approach, which they have called ExGAN, relies on two key ideas. Firstly, to mitigate the lack of training data in the extreme tails of the data distribution, they use a novel distribution shifting approach, which gradually shifts the data distribution in the direction of increasing extremeness. This allows them to fit a GAN in a robust and stable manner, while fitting the tail of the distribution, rather than its bulk. Secondly, to generate data at any given extremeness probability, they use EVT-based conditional generation, training a conditional GAN, conditioned on the extremeness statistic. This is combined with EVT analysis, along with keeping track of the amount of distribution shifting performed, to generate new samples at the given extremeness probability.</p>
<p>To verify their approach, the authors provide a thorough analysis using <a href="https://water.weather.gov/precip/">US precipitation data</a> from 2020. They show that they are able to generate realistic and extreme rainfall patterns. Another important aspect of the work is that the authors are able to generate extreme samples in constant time, as opposed to the exponential time taken by the baseline. </p>

<blockquote><p><strong><em>They flushed billions and billions and billions of dollars down the drain.</em></strong></p></blockquote>



<p><em>By Cory Doctorow /</em><a href="http://pluralistic.net/"><em> Pluralistic.net</em></a></p>



<p>When they write the history of this era, one of the strangest chapters will be devoted to Uber, a company that was never, ever going to be profitable, which existed solely to launder billions for the Saudi royals,</p>



<p>From the start, Uber’s “blitzscaling” strategy involved breaking local taxi laws (incurring potentially unlimited civil liability) while losing (lots of) money on every ride. They flushed billions and billions and billions of dollars down the drain.</p>



<p>But they had billions to burn. Mohammed bin Salman, the murdering Crown Prince of the Saudi royal family, funded Softbank – a Japanese pump-and-dump investment scheme behind Wework and other grifts – with $80B as part of his “<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/24/zawinskiian-carcination/#gusher">Vision 2030</a>” plan.</p>



<p>Vision 2030 is a scheme to diversify Saudi wealth away from hydrocarbons by attempting to establish monopolies that will allow the family to control entire sectors of the global economy.</p>



<p>These schemes are longshots, and the fallback position is to unload failed monopolies – with staggering debt-overhangs – on investors who’ve been suckered with the promise that really big piles of shit surely have a pony buried underneath them somewhere.</p>



<p>That’s what happened with Uber’s IPO, of course – Softbank and Mister Bone Saw made out like bandits and Uber now lumbers on under the ownership of problem gamblers who read the company’s S1 and bought in anyway.</p>



<p>The S1 – the document that explains how the company plans to be profitable – set two conditions for Uber’s profitability.</p>



<p>First, all the public transit in the world had to shut down and be replaced by Uber.</p>



<p>Next, all the drivers had to be replaced by AIs.</p>



<p>Needless to say, neither of these things were ever going to happen. Public transit is definitely in trouble after the pandemic, but we’re not gonna replace it all with Ubers.</p>



<p>And self-driving cars? Please.</p>



<p>Back in September, it became clear that Uber’s self-driving car labs were just window-dressing for the con. After spending $2.5B on the cars, they’d come up with vehicles that could <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#pogo-stick-problem">crawl half a mile</a> before losing their minds.</p>



<p>(Of course, self-driving car huxters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530232/self-driving-ai-winter-full-autonomy-waymo-tesla-uber">have an answer to this</a>: they argue that since cars can’t cope with unpredictable human conduct, we should just ban humans from acting unpredictably around their murderbots)</p>



<p>Every long con needs a “store” – a place where the con plays out, like a fake betting shop where the scammers rope in the mark and fleece them of every dime. But once the con is done, the store has to shut down amid a “blow-off” that lets the grifters escape.</p>



<p>Uber’s shutting down the AV part of its store: they “sold” the division to a<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/technology/uber-self-driving-car-project.html"> startup called Aurora</a>, but the “sale” involves Uber “investing” $400,000,000 in Aurora. That is, they’ve paid someone else to take this bit of set-dressing off their hands.</p>



<p>If you want to learn more about how Uber will never, never, ever, ever be a real business, be sure to tap into transport economist<a href="http://horanaviation.com/Uber.html"> Hubert Horan’s series</a> on the company, which he calls a “bezzle.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm speaking in front of 200 people tomorrow on the topic around software development for startups. There are hundreds of books written on this so I'll try to condense my learnings from most.</p><p>Even though we're a startup company at <a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a><a href="#"></a>, I stopped hiring software engineers, hell I tried to unlearn and relearn a few things in the journey as well.</p><p>Confusing I know - I still have to grapple around the entirety of it all but the honest truth is being a software engineer alone will get you easily fired or unvalued in a startup.</p><p>You need to fire yourself from that role and re-hire yourself as a product engineer. I've referenced this point multiple times in my previous articles and I really stand by this.</p><p>I don't think this necessarily applies for larger companies when they're hiring specialists and algo heavy engineers, however in a startup you need to think about the product, the marketing and most important the customer.</p><p>There is a significant disconnect in larger firms from the creator (developer) to the end user, all the way from hierarchy, to Project Managers, to Product Managers, to Marketers, to Execs etc - but in a startup, if you push code up... it's up.</p><p>So whats so special about being a product engineer that a software engineer can't do? A few things:</p><h3>1. They carry a get shit done attitude</h3><p>Sure some engineers carry that too, these statements aren't binary or exclusive but address the vast majority. When you look at github discussions or you look at conference events where people share their discoveries, it's all based around the engineer - not as much around the customer.</p><p>So yes, product engineers have a get shit done attitude, keeping in mind that they need to push good work out, but are quick on their feet to understand how much of debt some technical decisions will be vs others. This will be understood better over time, and even after a decade of programming, I can confirm that there is no right or wrong answer, its extremely situational based.</p><h3>2. Business first, software second</h3><p>You should toughen up and realise that building on the latest and greatest tech will not make you a better engineer. You almost NEVER have as much a good reputation for being the engineer for a bad startup as you may of a good startup, even though your code in the bad startup might be worthy of awards and your code in the good startup might be worthy of firing. It's inherent you see - good code isn't coincidentally in good companies, its because the companies made the smart decision of hiring mini-CTOs, people who understood that their customer mattered as much as their code.</p><p>This doesn't mean you give up all morals and build on PHP(I'M JOKING :p), but it kinda does. Not PHP but any language that is deemed unfit just because it's popular or not. You do a direct risk analysis on what will get me to my next goal ASAP. Whether that's faster iteration, more features or modularised code bases.</p><h3>3. Customer first, business second</h3><p>It should all come down to how you can make the life of the customer as easy as possible when you're solving the problem for them. Sometimes business requirements become business requirements and not customer requirements, and if you're just a software engineer by title, you will be doing what you're told to do because thats the limitation you have, at least the limitation I had a couple of years ago.</p><p>By stepping out of that box and understanding that if the business requirements step outside of the customer requirements, you get to voice your opinion and more importantly add the kicker to your "opinion" by justifying it with your technical abilities, techies are badass, we're the makers, so in the end if we have the knowledge around consumerism AS well as execution, it'll make us bulletproof.</p><p>So yes, if you're in a startup - don't work as a software engineer, work as a product engineer. Your impact will be 10X I kid you not.</p><p>People will take you ALOT more seriously, you'll climb the ranks faster, your code will matter a lot more, and the impact will be at scale. Your work matters and there should be no reason why more people shouldn't experience your genius code, the way you can make that happen is by being product focused and ensuring your customers are having the best time of their life.</p><p>As with any post, I'm always always looking to learn and become better at what I do, so I'd love to hear what you have to say, good or bad 🙌</p><p>If you liked this, definitely follow me on for the similar stuff:</p><p>twitter: twitter.com/<a href="https://dev.to/veebuv">@veebuv</a><br>linkedin: linkedin.com/in/vaibhavnamburi<br>instagram:_veebuv</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Recently I found myself needing to process and visualize both point clouds and meshes in an iOS application utilizing ARKit, with the point cloud being gathered using the 2020 iPad “LiDAR” sensor. To enable maximum performance and content creation convenience I thought it would be nice to have both custom shaders and a regular, easy-to-work-with 3D hierarchy available. The best options available seemed to be Metal and SceneKit, which required some initial setup to get working together. That setup is detailed in this post.</p>
<p><em>If all this sounds unfamiliar see <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/lidar-peek-into-the-future-with-ipad-pro-11d38910e9f8">here</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/2243-scene-kit-tutorial-getting-started">here</a> for introductions to these technologies.</em></p>

<p>To help you recreate what I did, the post is accompanied by a GitHub repository showing the specifics: <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal">github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note that the repo uses slightly confusing naming. XCode project name is “smTest” (for “SceneKit Metal test”), which leads to combinations such as smTestTest for the auto-generated unit testing project… not the best choice, but bear with me.</em></p>
<p><em>Also note that this is not really beginner level stuff, nor is having both SceneKit and Metal rendering usually required. If you just want to do some 3D+AR on iOS, good tech to start with would likely be either <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/">RealityKit</a>+<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/creating_3d_content_with_reality_composer">RealityComposer</a>, the more widely applicable tool <a href="https://tutorialsforar.com/creating-an-ar-app-for-ios-using-unity-and-arkit/">Unity</a> or just plain <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/building-an-ar-app-with-arkit-and-scenekit/">SceneKit</a>.</em></p>

<p>RealityKit seems like the future, but I was interested in custom shaping of meshes at runtime with e.g. geometry shaders and there did not (yet?) seem to be hooks for integrating that kind of processing in RealityKit.</p>
<p>Turns out those hooks do exist in SceneKit, which is an older and more mature technology. They can be used to implement custom render steps either before or after regular rendering. A helpful blog post with details that aided me with the ‘<strong>renderer didRenderScene</strong>’ hook can be found here: <a href="https://rozengain.medium.com/custom-metal-drawing-in-scenekit-921728e590f1">Custom Metal Drawing in SceneKit</a>. Thanks for the writeup Mr. Ippel!</p>
<p>I chose to get started with combining ARKit, SceneKit and custom Metal rendering by mashing two of Apple’s example applications together:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Scene Depth demo app (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualizing_a_point_cloud_using_scene_depth">Visualizing a Point Cloud Using Scene Depth</a>)</li>
<li>The default SceneKit AR project created by the XCode project wizard (creation steps depicted below)</li>
</ul>

</a>


<p>The trickiest part was to get the depth blending working correctly. SceneKit and the custom Metal renderer of the Point Cloud demo use different depth buffer conventions, which caused a few moments of initial confusion before realizing I would have to adjust depth settings to make them compatible.</p>
<p>Initial depth buffer ranges <em>(from memory, might be incorrect)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SceneKit:</p>
<ul>
<li>empty = zero</li>
<li>growing towards camera</li>
<li>range around 0.00-0.05</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>SceneDepthPointCloud Metal renderer</p>
<ul>
<li>empty = negative infinity(?)</li>
<li>shrinking towards camera</li>
<li>range around 1.0-9.9995</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the depth blending behave nicely and consistently, it was needed to set the proper depth blending mode (<em>shown as DepthStencilState –&gt; DepthCompareFunction in the XCode Frame Debugger</em>), to find matching value ranges for both depth buffers and to keep the 3D scenes of both renderers in their respective camera frustums (having good values for znear and zfar) so that they would not get culled off by being too near or too far.</p>

<p>If you’re working in a recent Apple dev environment in a fairly empty project, there’s a good chance you can get started with GPU debugging right away. You just need to build and run your app and press the camera icon (and wait a bit):</p>

<p>If you crave more in-depth GPU debug options or have trouble getting started, more info can be found on the page about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/frame_capture_debugging_tools">Frame Capture Debugging Tools</a> as well as the guide page for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/frame_capture_debugging_tools/enabling_frame_capture">Enabling Frame Capture</a>.</p>

<p>For more specific details on how I combined the two renderers, see the changes included in the first few commits (Nov 24th &amp; 28th) on the <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commits/main">commits page</a> of the example repository. It shows the history of how I:</p>
<ul>
<li>started with a blank SceneKit AR project using the Project Wizard (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/3d5358507d2824d0d57335d6988ec81d20291b9d">Initial commit</a>)</li>
<li>added custom Metal rendering as per Mr. Ippel’s <a href="https://rozengain.medium.com/custom-metal-drawing-in-scenekit-921728e590f1">post</a> (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/75ad32f2012594ba3c09df9f351299d64f0ecb59">draws simple triangle, …</a>)</li>
<li>copied in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/visualizing_a_point_cloud_using_scene_depth">SceneDepthPointCloud</a> demo and made sure the application still builds (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/cbcdaf130a288a7ad68cd2a848ddd671269b93d6">builds with SceneDepthPointCloud …</a>)</li>
<li>fiddled with accumulation settings etc confusedly to get the thing closer to working (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/39ba6d28e7f22ae202e20344c503a2136932f3ff">almost works …</a>)</li>
<li>and finally adjusted the depth blending, depth range and camera frustum settings to be able to see both scenes together (<a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/4a60df6c60b380d72ec740171c3440ffa09ddc23">improved …</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emllnd/ar-with-scenekit-and-metal/commit/39c9a0e7a997567ca978e1190b67cd2af9790666">draws both …</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result of all these steps can be seen in motion below. It is of course merely the starting point for a more interesting application that leverages the ease and speed of regular 3D asset workflows and selectively applies the power of customized GPU processing as needed.</p>

<p>At the time of first publication of this post (Dec 2020) I’m not sure if the depth buffer is entirely in sync between the two renderers, even though they both do render simultaneously. The point cloud looks alright behind the rocketplane(? 😄), but I’m not sure whether they behave correctly in overlap situations. However, the fix should be just a matter of adjusting camera and depth buffer parameters and possibly scene scale (<em>famous last words…</em>).</p>
<p>If and when time permits, I will update the post and the repository with improved details.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                <p>2020 became a huge game-changer in nearly every aspect of life, bringing new
                    habits, practices, and relationships. The trust issues became even more important. We are heading to
                    an end of the year that requires all of us to take the necessary steps to get through the crisis,
                    face up to the challenges, redefine business goals and come to conclusions for the future. We have
                    all experienced, to some extent, the aftermath caused by global lockdown - the economic slowdown,
                    varied models in response to the crisis. 2020 was a year of testing, remodeling, and creating
                    multiple scenarios. These challenging conditions affected the way people perceive and want to hold
                    conversations with professionals, as well as match business partners. Here you can find some useful,
                    universal information about the global changes in B2B that were dictated by the recent pandemic and
                    how they may help redefine strategy for 2021. Some data and personal view for the passing year as
                    well as tips for the year ahead.</p>

                <h2>Global response in B2B sales</h2>
                <p>Following the survey conducted by
                    <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/survey-global-b2b-decision-maker-response-to-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
                        McKinsey&amp;Company
                    </a>
                    , the preferences and
                    behaviors of B2B decision-makers have changed dramatically since the beginning of 2020. This applies
                    to the way how business meetings were arranged, as well as to services provided by various
                    participants. Global trends redefine how B2B sales models diversify affected by the pandemic. The
                    survey applies to the new state of sales, and business management which might be helpful when
                    designing new strategies, funnels, and creating partnerships. This is a good time for rethinking and
                    implementing, for both current and future projects, because the design that takes into account the
                    preferences of decision-makers will play a significant role in creating the company’s value and
                    future profits.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Remote and self-service</b> models are preferred by 70-80% of decision-makers. The advantages
                    pointed
                    out are travel savings, safety, and ease of scheduling a meeting. This approach applies either to
                    ordering and reordering, as well as identifying and evaluating new suppliers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>New sales models</b> are as efficient or even more powerful than the prior models. In April 2020
                    65% of
                    respondents declared that remote sales are as effective as face-to-face meetings (or even better
                    performing). In August the number of respondents claiming the effectiveness of remote sales
                    increased up to 75%. Additionally, 45% of respondents pointed out that remote sales were more
                    effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The order value</b> for remote sales or self-service does not only apply to the low-value
                    purchase. 70%
                    of B2B decision-makers declare the purchase of up to 500,000 USD via a self-service or remote
                    interaction. 97% of the B2B clients consider a purchase in an end-to-end digital purchase model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The new normal will become a new normal.</b> Nearly 90% of the respondents declared that the new,
                    remote
                    sales models will stay for a longer time, and 60% declared to keep a certain limit in face-to-face
                    meetings, even if the salesforce will be ready to meet in-person. Most companies point out
                    additional sets to become successful, these are the ability to remote transition, basic video
                    technology, new profiles of sales representatives, redesigned sales training. Over 80% of B2B
                    companies declare to introduce more agile sales processes and focus on different sales methods,
                    while nearly 60% plan to decrease the number of sales representatives, 70% plans to switch to a more
                    dynamic resource model.
                </p>

                <h2>What are the forecasts for the economy of 2021?</h2>

                <p>
                    After the global economic decline, the market is expected to bounce back. In the mid-2020 we faced a
                    V-shaped recovery, that is noted, to drive to excel pre-pandemic GDP levels by the end of this year
                    - setting the stage for strong post-recovery growth in 2021. The economists from
                    <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/global-economic-outlook-2021" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
                        Morgan Stanley
                    </a>
                    point out that now we are entering a new phase that is on track to deliver 6.4% GDP growth in the
                    coming year. Several industries generally have been more affected by the effects of global lockdown,
                    despite fears and uncertainties, global forecasts are more optimistic than they might seem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking into account the changes that will remain with us, as well as the predictions for 2021, and
                    the fact that we will never return 100% to pre-pandemic behavior and processes, it is worthwhile to
                    redefine the core strategy. When looking for new opportunities, as well as setting new strategic
                    goals, you should not reject the solutions given on the plate. Knowing that the expected growth, as
                    well as digital relationships, will be fed by credibility, trust, and experience, these qualities
                    will play an even more important role in building sustainable partnerships than before. Combining
                    with excellent customer service, unique experiences, and discovering new paths will boost the global
                    recovery, as well as will set businesses on a new road to success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2020 proved that we create a system of connected vessels. When one broke, the next dependent parts
                    started to leak. After a year of uncertainty, another optimistic view is that since we live in a
                    mostly digitized world, where partnerships transcend political borders, the recovery is expected to
                    happen even faster. Asynchronous recovery, on both, developed and emerging markets will accelerate
                    in the same year. The exact speeding up is assumed around March or April when most of the
                    geographies and sectors will join the revival.
                </p>

                <h2>Customer experience will play a central role</h2>

                <p>
                    Promising forecasts are ahead, here are some thoughts which you can execute right now to be prepared
                    for an upturn. Strengthen your partnerships and focus on making new ones. Setting a customer in a
                    center of all your efforts, or in other words, having a focus on your customer’s needs and filling
                    their expectations, will help you win 2021. Accelerated digital transformation will continue to
                    grow, mapping, and designing improved customer journeys. According to the
                    <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/as-businesses-plan-for-2021-customer-experience-will-play-a-central-role-in-recovery-from-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
                        research
                    </a>
                    , 87% of
                    professionals say customer feedback became more important than it was before the pandemic.
                    Businesses also gather feedback in new places, 60% of respondents claimed they’ve added new
                    touchpoints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fast response will be crucial but must be followed in the right direction. Whether it is B2B or
                    B2C, the rules are similar. Understanding the value you can provide, and what your customers expect
                    from you will let your business make strategic changes quickly and confidently. That’s one principle
                    that establishes agile businesses apart from the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Face-to-face meetings won’t happen anytime soon, and even if, these will differ from what we have
                    known. Digital experiences will play a dominant role. E-commerce and digital actions have become
                    more important, keeping a close eye on the customer experience, setting new paths, and testing new
                    digital channels will become the new winning strategy. The data that can be gathered and analyzed
                    via digital channels will help improve decision making, shaping the future of your business, and
                    prepare to better react when unexpected turbulences appear. Consider how the experience you’re
                    delivering via the website or digital services could play a dominant role in the 2021 strategy.
                </p>

<p>"Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative, so we're building the features of Firebase but we're using open source tools. We try to use existing open source tools wherever possible. We tried to identify a nice scalable enterprise-grade open source tool for one of the features that Firebase has, and then we wrapped the easiness of Firebase around it". // Paul Copplestone, Supabase CEO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is most prominent in their database system which started with PostgreSQL, which is the relational database for Supabase with NoSQL.</p>
<p>The only thing that is not open-source so far is the dashboard. It has an air table view built on top of PostgreSQL, it has a SQL and Auto Auth.</p>

<p>Supabase has a feedback widget in the dashboard on the top right, when you are logged in, you can just drop a note and once you do that it is received on the Slack and you can chat with the team directly. If you have any problem, the team can debug them with you. This is a great way for Supabase to squash these bugs, have 5-9s uptime, and stay forward.</p>

<p>“We have actually used Supabase to build Supabase. You finding bugs is helping the platform so it is great to have the community in our corner.” // Paul Copplestone, Supabase CEO</p>

<h2>The Future of Supabase</h2>
<p>Actually, Supabase just got to the tail-end of the Alpha working on stability and launched it's beta version today (3 December 2020) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 9 months of building, 3102 databases launched, 505 issues fixed, and 238,000 lines of code written - we're moving into Beta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently focused on three parameters - Security, Reliability and Performance. Reliability especially now on APIs spent and locking down the new developer experience around the API.</p>
<p>“The only thing that may be called out as a caveat”, mentions Copplestone, “is that we only have JavaScript libraries so you can use every React native but you might have a hard time using it within the other mobile platforms.”</p>

December 10, 2020 | https://www.coryzue.com/writing/black-friday/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.coryzue.com/writing/black-friday/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>A few weeks ago I was in a bad place.</p>

<p>My product Pegasus—a <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">Django boilerplate for SaaS applications</a>—was 
having its worst sales slump in recent history.
Meanwhile, my other product, Place Card Me—an <a href="https://www.placecard.me/">online place card maker</a>—continued
to be hit hard by the pandemic, with sales down almost $10,000 from 2019.
It looked like I was going to fall short on my targets for the month. 
<em>Again</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/place-card-me-2020.png" alt="Place Card Me"></p>

<p>The grey line is Place Card Me’s profits in 2019. The purple line is 2020. Thanks, Covid.</p>

<p>And then on a lark I thought, “well maybe I’ll try running a Black Friday sale.”</p>

<p><strong>And my month’s trajectory completely changed.</strong></p>

<p>A few hours of work and a week later, and I had shattered my previous earnings for any month—earning
more than 3 months’ worth of typical profit in a single week.</p>

<p>Through the process, I learned a lot about running sales—lessons I thought I should share.
Because Black Friday <em>is</em> a huge opportunity for online creators and indie hackers. 
One that—if you’re anything like me—you’re probably not taking full advantage of.</p>

<p>Here’s what I did and what I learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-to-run-a-sale-by-overcoming-the-ickiness-factor">Deciding to run a sale by overcoming the “ickiness factor”</h2>

<p>If you’re like me, your first reaction to the idea of a Black Friday sale might be something along the lines of 
“ugh, those are so overdone and spammy”.
And it’s true, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales have become ubiquitous online.</p>

<p><em>But Black Friday sales aren’t inherently bad.</em></p>

<p>Many consumers, including myself, happily take place in Black Friday deals.
They’re a great way to support creators and pick up products you’ve long considered buying.</p>

<p>To get over my fear of “Black Friday ickiness”, I decided to turn to other successful creators who were also running deals.
Adam Wathan and Steve Shoger of <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> / <a href="https://refactoringui.com/">Refactoring UI</a>;
online educator extraordinaire <a href="https://wesbos.com/">Wes Bos</a>;
fellow solopreneur <a href="https://mtlynch.io/">Mike Lynch</a> for his product <a href="https://tinypilotkvm.com/">TinyPilot</a>.
How were they doing Black Friday and what could I learn from them?</p>

<p>My favorite example came from Wes Bos, which <a href="https://marketingexamples.com/">Harry’s Marketing Examples</a>
did a great job analyzing:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/wes-bos-black-friday.jpeg" alt="Wes Bos Black Friday"></p>

<p>Wes Bos’s “masterful” Black Friday email. Image and analysis from <a href="https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1331573176405536769">Harry’s Marketing Examples</a></p>

<p>This email and the others I looked at all shared similar qualities.
They were <em>genuine</em>, they <em>put the reader first</em>, and they <em>weren’t too pushy</em>.
It was “hey, here’s a great deal in case you’re interested, if not, sorry to bug you.”</p>

<p>Seeing that it was possible to run a deal in a classy way was enough to get me over the “ickiness” factor,
and provided a framework for crafting my own sales communications.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Running a sale doesn’t have to be “icky” if you do it right.</strong></p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-right-sale-structure-by-adding-value">Choosing the right sale structure by <em>adding value</em></h2>

<p>People expect Black Friday deals to offer a huge discount from normal prices—particularly 
for online products. Here’s a typical deal I received, with bundle of fonts being offered at 95% off 
the normal price:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/wild-ones-black-friday.png" alt="Wild Ones Font Bundle"></p>

<p>A typical Black Friday deal—offering 95%-off a bundle of commercial fonts.</p>

<p>Offering a huge discount is a great way to drive sales, but it comes with a huge cost. 
<em>Literally</em>. A big discount will substantially reduce your revenue-per-customer and 
leave money on the table.</p>

<p>And that’s not the only problem.</p>

<p>In addition to the lost revenue, <em>massive discounts devalue your product</em>.
If your customers know that you sometimes sell your product for 95% off, they’re likely 
to think it’s only worth 5% of it’s price.
<em>You’ve just turned your valuable good into a commodity.</em></p>

<p>So how do you run a sale without reducing your prices? <strong><em>You add value.</em></strong></p>

<p>Take Adam Wathan and Steve Shoger’s deal.
They took their two products, <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> (normally $249) and 
<a href="https://refactoringui.com/">Refactoring UI</a> (normally $149), and bundled them together for $279.
Their customers are simultaneously <em>saving $120</em> while <em>paying more than the price of either individual product.</em>
This is adding value at its finest.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/refactoring-ui.jpg" alt="Refactoring UI Black Friday"></p>

<p>The Tailwind UI / Refactoring UI deal—which used bundling to offer 30% off while simultaneously increasing prices.</p>

<p><em>Bundling</em>—what Adam and Steve did by offering two products together at a discount—is a great way to 
add value while not lowering prices.
A similar approach is to <em>offer increased benefits on a lower pricing tier</em>. 
This is the approach I took with my own product.</p>

<p>My product, <a href="https://www.saaspegasus.com/">SaaS Pegasus</a>, is designed to help people launch new web applications quickly.
Pegasus has two pricing tiers, a <em>single-site</em> version for $295, and an <em>unlimited</em> version for $750.
The product is the same, but the single-site version is only able to be used on—well—a single site,
while the unlimited version can be used on—you guessed it—unlimited sites.
The unlimited version also comes with lifetime updates to Pegasus itself, instead of just a year.</p>

<p>Anyway, the details aren’t important, but what <em>is</em> important is that more than 90% of my customers 
opt—at least initially—for single-site. 
So for my Black Friday deal I decided to offer the unlimited version at price of single-site. 
This allowed me to offer a 60% discount without significantly reducing my revenue per customer
or devaluing my product.</p>

<p>Whether you use bundling, the “increased benefits on a lower tier” approach, or something else, 
adding value is a great way to create a “Black Friday deal” feeling while not incurring 
some of the financial and psychological costs associated with heavy discounting.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Don’t lower prices, add value.</strong></p>



<p>Ok, you’ve gotten over the ickiness factor and you’ve chosen a sale structure that adds value.
Now’s the most important part: <em>spreading the word</em>.</p>

<p>When considering how best to get the word out, think of the following breakdown.
Everyone is either <em>interested</em> or <em>not interested</em> in your sale.
Likewise everyone will either <em>find out</em> or <em>not find out</em> about it.
This creates four buckets that any person might fall into:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/sale-matrix.png" alt="Sale Categorization Breakdown"></p>

<p>Breakdown of the possible ways people can experience your sale.</p>

<p>The two green boxes are what you’re aiming for. 
Of course, you want everyone who might be interested in the sale to find out about it—these are your potential customers!
Also, you want everyone who <em>isn’t</em> interested in the sale to not get spammed by it—the blissfully unaware.</p>

<p>The tradeoffs and mistakes happen in the red boxes.
What you really want to prevent is <em>lost customers</em>—people who would have been interested in the deal
but never knew it was happening.
You also want to annoy as few people as possible, but <em>it’s generally better to promote the deal to someone who wasn’t interested
than to have someone who was interested miss it</em>. 
The upside of a potential sale clearly outweighs the downside of mildly annoying someone.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson: Default to promoting everywhere that the signal-to-noise ratio isn’t terrible.</strong></p>

<h3 id="where-to-promote-your-sale">Where to promote your sale</h3>

<p>The key avenues for promotion—in order of importance—are your <em>website</em>, your <em>email list</em>, and <em>other online marketing channels</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Your website is your best source of potential customers.</strong></p>

<p>No one is more likely to be interested in your deal than someone who is already browsing your product website,
so you should do everything you can to ensure all website visitors see your deal.</p>

<p>I used the common technique of splashing a big-ass colorful banner on every page of the site.
Here’s what it looked like.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/pegasus-sale.png" alt="Pegasus Sale"></p>

<p>Don’t be shy promoting your sale on your website. These are the people most likely to benefit from it.</p>

<p>Your goal is to make it impossible for someone visiting your website to not hear of the sale,
so err on the side of flashy, even if it seems a bit much.</p>

<p><strong>Your email list is your next best source of potential customers.</strong></p>

<p>People on your email list were interested in your product at one point, and so are more likely
than almost anyone else to still be interested, so make sure to let them know!</p>

<p>My email sequence consisted of two mails:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An email at the start of the sale telling people about it.</li>
  <li>An email with 24 hours left in the sale telling people it was about to end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people add a third email in the middle—often with 48 hours to go. 
I don’t recommend more than 3 emails as you seriously risk pushing people 
further into the “annoyed” category.</p>

<p>In terms of email copy—you can’t do better than the Wes Bos example above.
But for the sake of transparency, here’s the mail I used:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.coryzue.com/images/black-friday/pegasus-email.png" alt="Pegasus Email"></p>

<p>The first email in my sequence announcing the Pegasus Black Friday deal.</p>

<p>One difference between Wes and I is that my email list is <em>cold</em>—I almost never use it.
So I added a reminder for people who might be wondering what Pegasus even was.
I also included details on some new features to show that I’m still improving the product.</p>

<p><strong>All other channels besides your website and email list are a distant third in terms of usefulness.</strong></p>

<p>For this reason, I severely limited promotion in other places unless they were 
specifically aggregating Black Friday deals—and therefore unlikely to annoy anyone.</p>

<p>Depending on your product and audience, social media can be a good channel, though it’s not for Pegasus
so I didn’t bother promoting there.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>It’s important to realize that unless you did something very wrong, 
<strong><em>people will be more likely to purchase your product during a sale than at any other time.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, if you’ve taken the advice above and are still getting good revenue-per-customer during
the sale, there is an interesting side-effect:
<strong>website traffic <em>during a sale</em> is more valuable than at any other time</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll show you just how much more valuable it was for me in the next section <em>(preview: it was way more than I expected)</em>.</p>

<p>In practice, this means that any additional effort you can expend to get people to your website—for any reason—will 
have a higher payoff during a sale.</p>

<p>How you leverage this information depends on your marketing strategy.
If you’re running ads, consider increasing your budget while the sale is running;
if you do content marketing, consider publishing your next big article during the sale, etc.
These efforts—while not necessarily directly related to the sale—will have the side-effect of getting
more eyes on your site at the exact moment your …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>30 Oct 2020 • 5 min read</p><p>Throughout his life, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was well known as a man of productivity. Before he was president, he was a five start general of the US Army, being a key strategist for many invasions against the Nazis in World War II. On becoming President, he launched many of the significant projects and departments that are still integral to the USA today, such as the interstate highway system, NASA and DARPA. His productivity became well-renowned and researched, and by far one of the most useful strategies he's credited for devising is the Eisenhower Matrix. A simple method to deploy in our everyday lives, it can help you increase productivity, avoid procrastination, and order your workflow. So, what exactly is it and how does it work?</p><picture><source type="image/webp" media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix@2x.webp 2x"><source type="image/webp" media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-md.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-md@2x.webp 2x"><source type="image/webp" media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-sm.webp, https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-sm@2x.webp 2x"><source media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix@2x.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-md.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-md@2x.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-sm.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix-sm@2x.jpg 2x"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/eisenhower-matrix/eisenhower-matrix.jpg" alt="Illustration of person watching on Eisenhower Matrix and thinking"></picture><h2 id="what-is-the-eisenhower-matrix%3F">What is the Eisenhower Matrix?</h2><p>The method begins by creating a 2x2 matrix. On the X axis of our matrix we have Urgent and Not Urgent. On the Y axis, we have Important and Not Important. With these different boxes, we have four quadrants, each with a different value, and as such, each to be handled very differently.</p><p>The four quadrants are essentially divided into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Urgent and important - <strong>do it</strong></li><li>Important, but not urgent - <strong>schedule it</strong></li><li>Urgent, but not important - <strong>delegate i</strong>t</li><li>Neither urgent, nor important - <strong>eliminate it</strong></li></ul><p>The Eisenhower Matrix teaches us to swiftly recognise the importance and urgency of tasks on our to-do lists. By categorising the tasks in the above way we can figure out which ones to prioritise, which to put on the back-burner for later, which to delegate, and which to eliminate. This will both put your to-do list in an order of priority, and shrink it down.</p><p>But how do we distinguish between “urgent and important” and everything in between?</p><h2 id="what-are-%22urgent%22-and-%22important%22-activities%3F">What Are "Urgent" and "Important" Activities?</h2><p>Important things are, well, important.They are the things that move us closer to our defined goals, dreams, and aspirations in life. They have meaning and impact to what actually matters to us in our lives. Running in alignment with your values, important things include, going to the gym, spending time with your family, or coming up with a strategic plan for your business.</p><p>On the other hand, we have urgent things. Urgent things require your immediate attention like a call from an angry customer, or picking up your kid from the nurse's office at school.</p><p>More often than not, things don’t tend to be both important and urgent. A lot of the time we mistake urgent tasks as being inherently important, with their acute timeframe masking the true value of what they actually represent in our lives.</p><p>The Eisenhower Matrix is an amazing tool to combat this frequent “mislabelling” of tasks in our workflow, and by mapping out a matrix of urgency and importance, we get a clearer picture of what’s on our slate.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-the-eisenhower-matrix-effectively">How to Use the Eisenhower Matrix Effectively</h2><p>In order to implement the Eisenhower Matrix effectively, one must identify which of the four quadrants a task or a project sits in, and then give it the appropriate action. So what are the traits that come with each category, and (having filed the task appropriately) what should you do with it?</p><h3 id="quadrant-one%3A-urgent-and-important">Quadrant One: Urgent and Important</h3><p>These are tasks that are not only important, but also time sensitive. These might include taking care of a sick relative, addressing an order-dispute for your biggest customer or fixing a crucial bug on the company website. Hopefully you shouldn’t have too many of these but something landing in this box should be done immediately with everything else put aside to make space for it.</p><h3 id="quadrant-two%3A-important%2C-but-not-urgent">Quadrant Two: Important, But Not Urgent</h3><p>This is where some of the most important things in our lives live, and yet many people will see tasks piling up here. Why? Because these jobs are not urgent we often let them slide or delay into the indefinite. Whilst they might not have the immediacy of Quadrant One tasks, it’s important to recognise they are truly no less important.</p><p>These tasks include long-term strategy and planning meetings with your team, performing regular website maintenance, exercising, spending quality time with your friends and family, meditating, and sleeping enough.</p><p>These things won't pop out at you with red flashing lights, but there's no denying that they are extremely important. Indeed if not taken care of, they could soon turn into a hoard of urgent jobs bashing on the door of Quadrant One.</p><p>When it comes to Quadrant Two tasks, stop procrastinating and make a decision. Ask yourself, “When will I sit down and do these things?”. If you're a business owner or a manager in a company, these tasks are probably the most significant part of your job. It’s tempting to ignore Quadrant Two for the sake of addressing Quadrant Ones and Quadrant Threes, but come under no illusions, these need to be tackled, so schedule them in and stick to those deadlines.</p><h3 id="quadrant-three%3A-urgent%2C-but-not-important">Quadrant Three: Urgent, But Not Important</h3><p>We all hate to admit it, but a lot of the stuff we do, whilst urgent, is actually not important at all. For example, monitoring comments on your website or social media, attending a quarterly business update, or scheduling a Zoom meeting. Of course these are worth doing, but they’re just not important. Certainly not enough for you to actually do them yourself. That's why the answer to Quadrant Three tasks is a simple one: delegate. Find a technological solution, an automation, or a human being who can help you with this task and pass it off to them. Ideally you want to spend as little of your time as possible in Quadrant Three.</p><h3 id="quadrant-four%3A-not-urgent%2C-and-not-important">Quadrant Four: Not Urgent, and Not Important</h3><p>These represent a large category of tasks that aren't worth your time or anyone else’s for that matter (not even that programme or person you got to help you out in Quadrant Three). Some of these may be enjoyable, but they're not moving you towards your desired goals in any way, shape, or form. Things like watching television or scrolling through social media for example. While Quadrant Four tasks inevitably pervade our lives, look to try and eliminate these activities as much as possible.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-the-eisenhower-matrix-to-increase-productivity">How to Use the Eisenhower Matrix To Increase Productivity</h2><p>The Eisenhower Matrix is especially useful if you find yourself dealing with excessive amounts of work. With an overabundance of tasks, taking a bit of time to categorise your jobs into the four quadrants above can restore order to an otherwise chaotic workflow.</p><p>It’s also good to incorporate the overarching philosophy of this time management matrix into your daily workflow. Whether it’s on a daily or weekly basis, the Eisenhower Matrix will help prioritise the items on your to-do list. Look to commit to scheduling or prioritising your tasks as per the above, and you’ll find yourself with a clearer and more effective work-day</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The nature of our work-environment today, as shaped by email, instant messaging and the like, means we feel constantly in need of prioritising our requests in order of when the message was received. However, this approach often leaves us with a feeling of dissatisfaction with our own productivity, finding that the majority of the day has been spent handling items we could have delegated or just eliminated, and jobs that don’t progress our life-goals or objectives.</p><p>Instead, the Eisenhower Decision Matrix provides an excellent framework to help you cut through the clutter and finish your most important work in record time, whilst making sure you’re not wasting precious hours and minutes on things that can either be done elsewhere or just not at all. By giving you the skill of distinguishing between which tasks truly demand your attention, and those that don’t, the Eisenhower Box will keep you focused on what’s important, and in doing so change not just the output you see in your day or your week, but also your life.</p></article></div>]]>

  <p>This is the story of how close we came to shutting down before even launching our first product, how we survived, and the lessons we learnt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In March, 2020, when COVID hit the world, our startup Milkie Way too was hit with a big blow and almost shut down. <strong>We burnt $72,000 while exploring and internally testing Cloud Run with Firebase within a few hours.</strong></p>

<p>In November 2019, after having the idea, I started developing <strong>Announce <a href="https://annc.in/">https://announce.today</a></strong>. The goal was to create an “MVP”, a functional V1 of the  product, and for this reason our code was based on a simple stack. We used JS, Python and deployed our product on Google App engine.</p>

<center>
<em>Announce on Desktop</em>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/post_images/anc-first-look.png" width="100%"><br>
</center>

<p>Having a very small team, our focus was on writing code, designing the UI and getting product ready. I spent minimal time in Cloud management, just enough to make us go live, and have basic development flow (cicd) going.</p>

<p>In the V1 web application, user experience was not the smoothest, but we just wanted to make a product that some of our users could experiment with, while we built a better version of Announce. With Covid hitting the world, we thought it was the best time to make a difference as Announce could be used by the governments to make announcements world wide.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be cool to have some rich data on the platform even if users don’t create content to begin with? This thought that led to another project, called <strong>Announce-AI</strong>. It’s purpose was to create rich content for Announce automatically. Rich data == events, safety warnings like earthquakes, and possibly local relevant news.</p>

<h3 id="some-technical-details">Some Technical Details</h3>
<p>To begin developing Announce-AI, we used Cloud Functions. As our bot scraping the web was fairly young, we believed light weight Cloud functions were the way to go. However, as we decided to scale, we ran into troubles because Cloud Functions have a timeout of ~9 minutes.</p>

<p>At this time we learn about Cloud Run, which then had a big free usage tier! Without understanding it completely, I asked my team to deploy a “test” Announce AI function on Cloud Run, and see it’s performance. The goal was to play around with Cloud Run, so we can learn and explore it really fast.</p>

<em>Google Cloud Run</em></center>

<p>To keep it simple, as our experiment was for a very small site, we used Firebase for database, as Cloud Run doesn’t have any storage, and deploying on SQL server, or any other DB for a test run would have been an over kill.</p>

<p>I created a new GCP project ANC-AI Dev, set up $7 Cloud Billing budget, kept Firebase Project on the Free (Spark) plan. The worst case we imagined was exceeding the daily free Firestore limits if we faltered.</p>

<p>After some code modifications, we deployed the code, ran it by making few requests in middle of the day manually and then left it.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-begins">Nightmare Begins</h3>
<p>Everything went fine on the day of test, and we got back to developing Announce. Next day after working, I went for a quick nap in late afternoon. On waking up I read few emails from Google Cloud, all sent within few minutes of each other.</p>

<center>
<em>First Email: Auto upgrade of our Firebase Project</em>

<em>Second Email: Budget Exceeded</em>

<p>Luckily my card had a spending limit of $100 preset. This led to declining the charges, and Google suspending all our accounts with it.</p>

<center>
<em>Third email: Card was declined</em>

<p>I jumped out of the bed, logged into Google Cloud Billing, and saw a bill for ~$5,000. Super stressed, and not sure what happened, I clicked around, trying to figure out what was happening. I also started thinking of what may have happened, and how we could “possibly” pay the $5K bill.</p>

<p>The problem was, every minute the bill kept going up.</p>

<p>After 5 minutes, the bill read $15,000, in 20 mins, it said $25,000. I wasn’t sure where it would stop. Perhaps it won’t stop?</p>

<p>After two hours, it settled at a little short of $72,000.</p>

<p>By this time, my team and I were on a call, I was in a state of complete shock and had absolutely no clue about what we would do next. We disabled billing, closed all services.</p>

<p>Because we used same company card across all our GCP Projects, all our accounts and projects were suspended by Google.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-continues">Nightmare Continues</h3>
<p>This happened on Friday evening, March 27th, 3 days before we had planned V1 of Announce to go live. Our product development was dead as Google suspended all our projects as they were tied to same credit card. My morale was as low as it could be, and the future of our company was unsure.</p>

<em>All our Cloud Projects were suspended; development stopped</em></center>

<p>Once my mind made peace with this new reality, at midnight I sat down to actually investigate what happened. I started writing a document detailing all the investigations… I called this document: “Chapter 11”.</p>

<p>Two of my team members who were in this experiment also stayed up all night investigating and trying to make sense of what had happened.</p>

<p>The next morning on Saturday, March 28th, I called and emailed over a dozen law firms to book an appointment / have a chat with some attorney. All of them were away, but I was able to get response from one of them over email. Because the details of the incident are so complicated even for engineers, explaining this to an attorney in plain english was a challenge of its own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a bootstrapped company, there was no way for us to come up with $72K.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this time, I was well versed with Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 of Bankruptcy and mentally prepared of what could come next.</p>

<h3 id="some-breather--gcp-loopholes">Some Breather : GCP Loopholes</h3>

<p>On the Saturday after sending emails to lawyers, I started reading more and going through every single page in GCP Documentation. We did make mistakes, but it didn’t make sense that Google let us spend $72K without even making a payment on the project before!</p>

<em>GCP and Firebase</em></center>

<h4 id="1-automatic-upgrade-of-firebase-account-to-paid-account">1. Automatic Upgrade of Firebase Account to Paid Account</h4>
<p>We never anticipated this, nor was this ever displayed while signing up for Firebase. Our GCP project had billing connected to have Cloud Run execute, but Firebase was under Free plan (Spark). GCP just out of the blue upgraded it, and charged us for the amount it needed to.</p>

<p>It turns out this is their process as “Firebase and GCP are deeply integrated”.</p>

<h4 id="2-billing-limits-dont-exist-budgets-are-at-least-a-day-late">2. Billing “Limits” don’t exist. Budgets are at least a day late.</h4>
<p>GCP Billing is actually delayed by at least a day. In most of their documentation Google suggests using Budgets and auto shut-off cloud function. Well guess what, by the time the cut off function would trigger, or the Cloud Users be notified, the damage would’ve probably been done.</p>

<p>Billing takes about a day to be synced, and that’s why we noticed the charges the next day.</p>

<h4 id="3-google-was-supposed-to-charge-us-100-not-72k">3. Google was supposed to charge us $100, not $72K!</h4>
<p>As our account had not made any payment thus far, GCP should’ve first made charge for $100 as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-cycle#find-threshold-amount">per billing info</a>, and on non-payment, stopped the services. But it didn’t. I understood the reason later, but it’s still not the user’s fault!</p>

<p>The first billing charge made to our account was of ~ $5,000. The next one for $72,000.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/automatic-payments.jpg" width="100%">
<em>Billing threshold for our account was $100</em>

</center>

<h4 id="4-dont-rely-on-firebase-dashboard">4. Don’t rely on Firebase Dashboard!</h4>
<p>Not just Billing, but even Firebase Dashboard took more than 24 hours to update.</p>

<p>As per Firebase Console documentation, the Firebase console dashboard numbers may differ ‘slightly’ from Billing reports.</p>

<p>In our case, it differed by <strong>86,585,365.85 %</strong>, or 86 million percentage points. Even when the bill was notified to us, Firebase Console dashboard still said 42,000 read+writes for the month (below the daily limit).</p>

<h3 id="new-day-new-challenge">New Day, New Challenge</h3>
<p>Having been a Googler for ~6.5 years and written dozens of project documents, postmortem reports, and what not, I started a document to share with Google outlining the incident, and adding the loopholes from Google’s side in a postmortem. Google team would come back to work in 2 days.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some readers suggested that I used my internal contacts at Google. The truth is that I haven’t been in touch with anyone, and I used the path that any normal developer / company would take. Like any other small developer, I spent countless hours on chat, in consults, lengthy emails, and bugs. In one of my next posts on how to look at incidents, I’d like to share the doc/postmortem I sent to Google during this incident.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/assets/images/72K/googleplex.jpg" width="40%"><br>
<em>Last day at Google</em></center>

<p>Another task was to understand our mistake, and devise our product development strategy. Not everyone on the team knew what was going on, but it was quite clear that we were in some big trouble.</p>

<p>As a Googler I had experienced teams making mistakes costing Google millions of dollars, but the Google culture saves the employees (except engineers have to write a long incident report). This time, there was no Google. Our own limited capital and our hard work, was at complete stake.</p>

<hr>

<p>This post is already getting long, so I’ll continue the details of how we managed to make this blunder, how we survived, and what did we learn.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Kunden sollen früh wissen, welche Briefe für sie unterwegs sind und wo sich Pakete befinden. Das Unternehmen will sich damit auch auf junge Kunden einstellen und sucht einen zeitgemäßen Weg für seine sehr analogen Produkte.</p><div itemprop="articleBody" data-testid="article-body"><p>Zwischen den Managern in schwarzen Anzügen strahlt ein Paketbote in gelb-roter DHL-Montur hervor. Wenn er nicht gerade bei der Vorstellung der neuen Digitalstrategie der Deutschen Post Modell steht, dann fährt Maik Berkholz mit einem 3,5-Tonner durch Berlin-Mitte. Seit zehn Jahren liefert Berkholz Pakete aus. Und neuerdings trägt er neben seinem Unterschriftgerät einen kleinen Drucker am Hosenbund. Denn Berkholz ist nicht mehr nur Paketbote, er frankiert auch Pakete und Briefe und nimmt sie im Lieferwagen mit. "Die Kunden finden das super", sagt er mit abgehacktem Berliner Zungenschlag, "wenn sie mir das mitgeben können und nicht bei der nächsten Filiale anstehen&nbsp;müssen."</p><p>Der kleine Drucker ist eine der vielen Ideen, mit der die Post eine dreifache Herausforderung meistern will: Ihre Kunden versenden von Jahr zu Jahr weniger Briefe, wenngleich die Menge in Deutschland bislang nicht so stark eingebrochen ist wie in anderen Staaten. Zugleich transportiert die Post immer mehr Pakete durchs Land, vor allem wegen des boomenden Onlinehandels. Die Bundesnetzagentur meldet freilich auch, dass sich immer mehr Menschen über die Post&nbsp;beschweren.</p><div><div data-hydration-component-name="ImageAsset"><figure><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"><img alt="20 Jahre Briefzentrum Gera" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></picture></div></div><figcaption><p>Eine Mitarbeiterin arbeitet an der Briefsortierungsanlage im Briefzentrum in Gera, Thüringen.</p> <small>(Foto: Martin Schutt/dpa)</small></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>"Wir wollen die sichere Zustellung von Paketen und Briefen beibehalten, diese aber mit der Digitalisierung koppeln", sagt Tobias Meyer, der Brief- und Paketchef der Post in&nbsp;Deutschland.</p><p>Dass Kunden Boten wie Berkholz Pakete mitgeben, das ging zwar schon früher. Neu ist aber, dass der Kunde das Adress- und Frankierfeld nicht mehr aufkleben muss. Stattdessen kann Berkholz ein selbstklebendes Adressfeld und eine Marke aus seinem mobilen Drucker ausdrucken. Dafür scannt der Bote einen Code vom Handy des Kunden ein. Der Code wurde erstellt, nachdem der Kunde via Post-App auf seinem Smartphone das Porto bezahlt und die Adresse eingegeben hat. Die "mobile Paketmarke" für die "mobile Retour", so nennt es Manager&nbsp;Meyer.</p><p>Mit der Digitalstrategie will die Post neuen Bedürfnissen der Kunden gerecht werden, aber auch Geld sparen. Das Versenden, das Empfangen, das Nachverfolgen von Sendungen - selbst Vorabbenachrichtigungen, was morgen im heimischen Briefkasten ankommen soll: All das soll effizienter werden. Bei der Vorstellung in Berlin erklären Männer in schwarzen Anzügen und eine Frau die neuen&nbsp;Services.</p><h4>Abfotografierte Briefe</h4><p>Einer der Männer in schwarz zeigt an seiner Station ein E-Mail-Postfach, in dem lauter gelbe Mails von der DHL lagern. Denn vom kommenden Sommer an wird es für Nutzer von GMX und Web.de möglich sein, Fotos von ihren Briefen zu sehen, bevor sie ausgeliefert&nbsp;werden.</p><p>Dazu scannt die Post eintreffende Briefe ein, ohne sie zu öffnen, und der Empfänger bekommt eine Mail mit dem Foto der Umschläge. Damit kennt man zwar beispielsweise noch nicht die Höhe des Bußgeldbescheids, aber weiß, dass ein solcher auf dem Weg&nbsp;ist.</p><p>Kunden müssen sich für dieses Angebot anmelden. Eine weitere Station präsentiert den Prototypen einer künftigen App-Funktion, die es im Laufe dieses Jahres ermöglichen soll, nachzusehen, wo sich ein erwartetes Paket gerade befindet. Damit reagiert die Post nicht nur auf die vielen Beschwerden über verspätete oder verloren gegangene Sendungen. Experten gehen auch davon aus, dass die sogenannte letzte Meile zu den Adressaten etwa die Hälfte der Kosten von Paketdiensten ausmachen. Konzerne wie die Post können also viel Geld sparen, wenn sie erfolglose Zustellversuche verhindern. Das neue Tracking zeigt den Kunden, wie viele Stopps noch zwischen dem Paketboten und der eigenen Haustüre liegen. Außerdem will die Post künftig am Tag vor der Auslieferung ein Zeitfenster von 90 Minuten angeben, in dem der Paketbote vorbei kommt. Empfänger könnten auch kurzfristig noch mitteilen, falls das Paket beim Nachbarn abgegeben werden soll, im Hausflur abgelegt werden soll, oder in der nächsten&nbsp;Packstation.</p><h4>Erweiterte Packstation</h4><p>Zudem führt ein Postvertreter die Packstation der Zukunft vor, die im Videochat mit dem Kunden kommunizieren soll und ebenfalls Adressfelder und Portosticker drucken kann. Die Post möchte die Zahl der Packstationen von 4000 im Laufe des Jahres auf 7000&nbsp;erhöhen.</p><p>Politisch interessant ist diese Ankündigung, da das Bundeswirtschaftsministerium derzeit an einer Reform des alten Postgesetzes von 1997 arbeitet. Ein Streitpunkt dabei: Wie viele Filialen muss die Post künftig noch aufrechterhalten? Sollte der Gesetzgeber die erweiterten Packstationen als Verkaufsstellen auf dem Land akzeptieren, hätte es der Konzern künftig einfacher, die Vorgaben zu&nbsp;erfüllen.</p><h4>Selbstgemachte Briefmarken</h4><p>An der letzten Station führt die Post vor, wie sie das Briefgeschäft auch für sogenannte Digital Natives - also junge Leute, die mit dem Internet großgeworden sind - attraktiv halten will. Über eine App kann der Kunde die Höhe des Portos wählen, diese spuckt dann einen Code aus Zahlen und Buchstaben aus. Der Kunde schreibt den Code auf das Kuvert mit dem Zusatz "#Porto" - und fertig ist die selbstgemalte Briefmarke. Aber Moment, die Handschrift als Teil einer&nbsp;Digitalisierungsoffensive?</p><p>Was paradox anmutet, soll es Kunden von Ende 2020 an ermöglichen, mit ihrem Handy eine Marke zu generieren. Bezahlt wird die "mobile Briefmarke" über die App mittels dem verbreiteten Bezahldienst Paypal. Ist dies das Ende der bunten Bildchen auf randgezackten Briefmarken? "Nein, nein", wiegelt Post-Vorstand Meyer ab. Es würden nach wie vor Briefmarken angeboten. Zudem glaubt er, dass die Code-Briefmarke aus dem Smartphone nur eine Ergänzung sein&nbsp;wird.</p><div><div><p><span>Streetscooter-Aus verstimmt Zulieferer</span></p><div><p>Die Deutsche Post hat mit dem angekündigten Aus ihrer Produktion des Streetscooters offenbar wichtige Vertragspartner überrumpelt. So erfuhr der Zulieferer Neapco nach eigenen Angaben "überraschend aus den Medien von dieser Nachricht". Neapco stellt der Post in Düren Produktionsflächen sowie etwa 120 Beschäftigte für die Montage der batteriebetriebenen Nutzfahrzeuge zur Verfügung. "Geplant war ein Anstieg der Mitarbeiterzahlen auf etwa 200 in den kommenden Monaten", heißt es von dem Dienstleister.</p>
<p>Die Post hat vorige Woche die Suche nach einem Käufer oder Investor für Streetscooter aufgegeben. Der Konzern verweist auf Millionenverluste seiner Autotochter. Er will die mehr als 11 000 bereits hergestellten E-Fahrzeuge zwar weiterbetreiben, doch soll die Produktion in Aachen und Düren in diesem Jahr auslaufen. Streetscooter beschäftigt selbst etwa 500 Menschen; hinzu kommen Mitarbeiter bei Dienstleistern wie Neapco. Die Post erklärt, dass sie das Aus von Streetscooter ad hoc kommunizieren musste, da es auch für den Kapitalmarkt relevant sei. Der Konzern geht davon aus, dass sich die Abschreibungen auf Streetscooter sowie die Kosten für den Personalabbau und die Abwicklung der Verträge auf bis zu 400 Millionen Euro summieren werden.</p>
<p>Unterdessen kritisiert der Streetscooter-Gründer Günther Schuh, die Post habe nach der Übernahme des Start-ups 2014 "Amateure eingesetzt, jegliche Verbesserung verboten und auf eine Gelegenheit gewartet, das Geschäft unter einem Vorwand einzustellen". Die Post habe Streetscooter weder ausreichend finanziert noch einen Zugang zum Kapitalmarkt gewährt, moniert der Aachener Professor in einem Handelsblatt-Gastbeitrag. Schuh war nach der Übernahme bei Streetscooter ausgeschieden. <span>Benedikt Müller</span></p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

December 10, 2020 | https://react.christmas/2020/10 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://react.christmas/2020/10">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><h3>What is Recoil ?</h3>
<p><a href="https://recoiljs.org/">Recoil.js</a> is a new state management library for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reactjs&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enNO890NO890&amp;oq=reactjs&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4j69i60l3.1252j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">React</a> — offering a React-ish API and a simple and powerful way of dealing with global, asynchronous and derived state 🔥</p>
<p>Recoil aims to solve some specific challenges when working with modern React apps like <em>flexible shared state</em>, <em>derived state</em> and <em>global observation</em>. And like React, the original Recoil team works at Facebook. </p>
<p>If you have worked with React it should seem familiar. Just take a look at this example. First we use React with <code>useState()</code> to increment a number:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> <span>Counter</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span>Count<span>:</span> <span>{</span>count<span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>span<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>button onClick<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>Increment<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, making our state global is pretty straightforward using Recoil. All we need to do (almost 😇) is to replace <code>useState</code> with <code>useRecoilState</code>.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>

<span>const</span> <span>Counter</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useRecoilState</span><span>(</span>myGlobalCounterState<span>)</span><span>;</span> ⬅

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span>Count<span>:</span> <span>{</span>count<span>}</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>span<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>button onClick<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>Increment<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That's pretty cool! Not convinced? Keep on reading... 😄</p>
<h3>Using Recoil - Examples</h3>
<p>The examples below are taken from a simple demo application called FoodTalk. The app lets you sort, filter and search for recipes. Take a look at the <a href="https://emilmork.github.io/recoil-foodtalk-demo/">demo</a> or the source code on <a href="https://github.com/emilmork/recoil-foodtalk-demo">github</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://react.christmas/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-08-at-8.40.35-pm.png"></p>
<p>Its a simple app, but it uses Recoil to solve some known challenges pretty well.</p>
<h5>Atoms</h5>
<p>An atom is simply a piece of state. It's like using react's <code>useState()</code>, except that any component can subscribe to it. By updating the atom value, all subscribed components will be re-rendered. In our recipe application we use atoms to store different types of state, like a search input:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> atom <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"recoil"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> searchState <span>=</span> <span>atom</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  key<span>:</span> <span>"searchStateKey"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>default</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To read and write to this atom we use <code>useRecoilState</code>.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> useRecoilState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"recoil"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> searchState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./store'</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>search<span>,</span> setSearch<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useRecoilState</span><span>(</span>searchState<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>input
        value<span>=</span><span>{</span>search<span>}</span>
        onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>setSearch</span><span>(</span>e<span>.</span>target<span>.</span>value<span>)</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span><span>}</span>
      <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h5>Selectors</h5>
<p>Our application need to handle a combination of state (derived state), and that's when we use a selector. In our recipe application we use a selector to return a filtered list of our recipes. Selectors are also memoized, making sure our performance is maintained.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> selector <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"recoil"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>const</span> filteredRecipesState <span>=</span> <span>selector</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    key<span>:</span> <span>"filteredRecipes"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>get</span><span>:</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> get <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>const</span> recipes <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetchRecipes</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

      <span>const</span> searchValue <span>=</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span>searchState<span>)</span><span>;</span> 

      <span>return</span> recipes
          <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>=&gt;</span> r<span>.</span>name<span>.</span><span>indexOf</span><span>(</span>searchValue<span>)</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can use the same <code>useRecoilValue()</code> on selectors as we do on atoms.
The cool thing here is that if our search state changes, our selector state will trigger a change as well.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> useRecoilValue <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'recoil'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> filteredItemsState <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./store'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>Recipes</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> filteredItems <span>=</span> <span>useRecoilValue</span><span>(</span>filteredItemsState<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>...</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Finally we need to add some spinners with React Suspense, which is supported out of the box.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>ErrorBoundery<span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;</span>Suspense fallback<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>&lt;</span>span<span>&gt;</span>Loading<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>span<span>&gt;</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
   <span>&lt;</span>Recipes <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
 <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>Suspense<span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>ErrorBoundery<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/emilmork/recoil-foodtalk-demo">github</a> to see all the code, which is also written in TypeScript. 😁</p>
<h3>So what's great about Recoil ?</h3>
<p>Libraries for React are constantly appearing, but <a href="https://recoiljs.org/">Recoil.js</a> is much more than “just another library”. Compared to other state libraries for React, Recoil feels like a fresh breath from the future - and it's great in so many ways:</p>
<h4>Tailored for React</h4>
<p>Recoil is made specifically for React and offers close compatibility with features like React Concurrent mode and React Suspense as we saw in the example. The team also claims to support new React features as they become available.</p>
<h4>Easy to learn</h4>
<p>When I tried Recoil I realized how complicated and difficult other state libraries like Redux were.</p>
<p>Recoil offers a simple API, with semantics and behavior in a known reactish manner. It also comes "boilerplate-free". All you need to get started is to wrap your code with RecoilRoot.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> RecoilRoot <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"recoil"</span><span>;</span>

ReactDOM<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>RecoilRoot<span>&gt;</span> ⬅️
      <span>&lt;</span>App <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>RecoilRoot<span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>⬅️
  document<span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h4>Flexible and powerful</h4>
<p>The concept of atoms let us isolate state in small pieces, making it very flexible. By using selectors we can easily combine pieces of state and move between being synchronous and asynchronous without modifying the components. It's also easy to observe and/or persist the entire state - which use be used to synchronize our state with a server or debug our app with time travel.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>The concept of derived state is very powerful, and atoms and selectors let you build a flexible and maintainable application. Its super easy to get started, and it really feels like a natural extension of React. It might not be a silver bullet, but if you need a way to handle distributed state in a simple manner - Recoil is your friend. 👍</p>
<p>Recoil is still in alpha and parts of the API might change, but based on the fact that Recoil is created by a Facebook team and currenty has 10k stars on github - I would say it’s pretty safe to try out.  😄 </p>
<p>I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/_ISAA_Jt9kI">Dave McCabe's presentation of Recoil</a>. He explains why they made Recoil and demonstrates the power of atoms and selectors.</p></section></article></div></div>]]>

December 10, 2020 | https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20201210/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20201210/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>You may be familiar with the use of a database <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(SQL)">upsert of MERGE</a> operation to insert a record into a table or update an existing record, if that record already exists. This evaluates the condition for finding the record only once, and is therefore more efficient than other alternatives. How can you efficiently handle a reverse operation of updating a record and deleting it if some condition holds?</p>
<p>The concrete problem involves reducing a counter in a database record, and deleting the record when the counter reaches zero. In most cases the counter is one; think of goods in a shopping basket. The naive way involves two SQL statements and two searches in the table: a <code>SELECT</code> to fetch the counter value, followed by a <code>DELETE</code> or an <code>UPDATE</code>.</p>
<p>One alternative involves an <code>UPDATE … RETURNING</code>, followed by a <code>DELETE</code> only if the returned value of the counter is zero. However, this performs an unneeded record change in the case of a counter having a value of one, optimizing the uncommon case (counter has a value higher than one) at the expense of the expected common case.</p>
<p>Another alternative, which indeed optimizes the expected common case, involves a <code>DELETE … WHERE … AND counter = 1</code>, followed by an <code>UPDATE</code> when no deletion takes place.</p>
<p>Both alternatives may require a wasteful second search for the record in the table. I thought there would be a method for this operation with an efficiency equivalent to that of an <em>upsert</em> operation, but a search, followed by a <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/281091/how-can-i-efficiently-delete-records-when-a-counter-reaches-zero-in-postgresql/">question on StackExchange</a> didn't turn out the answer I was looking for. One comment suggested streamlining the two operations with an SQL trigger, while another cleverly recommended running an <code>IF</code> after a conditional <code>DELETE</code> for the common case. Both again involved duplicate searching, which was what I thought would be wasteful.</p>
<h3 id="a-faster-solution">A faster solution?</h3>
<p>In the end, I dove into SQL cursors and came up with the following solution (for PostgreSQL).</p>
<div><pre><code>DO
$$
<span>-- Create a cursor pointing to the record</span>
<span>DECLARE</span>
  curs <span>CURSOR</span> <span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span> counter <span>FROM</span> elements <span>WHERE</span> … <span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>;
  <span>value</span> <span>integer</span>;
<span>BEGIN</span>
  <span>-- Find the record</span>
  <span>OPEN</span> curs;
  FETCH <span>FROM</span> curs <span>into</span> <span>value</span>;
  <span>-- Decide whether to decrement or delete</span>
  <span>IF</span> <span>value</span> &gt; <span>1</span> <span>THEN</span>
    <span>UPDATE</span> elements
      <span>SET</span> counter = counter - <span>1</span>
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>CURRENT</span> <span>OF</span> curs;
  <span>ELSE</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> elements
      <span>WHERE</span> <span>CURRENT</span> <span>OF</span> curs;
  <span>END</span> <span>IF</span>;
  <span>CLOSE</span> curs;
<span>END</span>
$$;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="measuring-performance">Measuring performance</h3>
<p>In response to this idea, <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/users/3684/erwin-brandstetter">Erwin Brandstetter</a>, a top-rated database expert on StackExchange and author of the clever answer optimizing the common case, <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/281091/how-can-i-efficiently-delete-records-when-a-counter-reaches-zero-in-postgresql/281208#comment549736_281208">suggested</a> that the cost of creating cursors would drown the cost of twice-searching for the record to update/delete. I therefore set out to measure the performance of the two alternatives.</p>
<p>First I generated a synthetic table of one million records where 80% of them had a counter with a value of one, to match Erwin's optimized case.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> elements;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> elements(
  <span>id</span> <span>integer</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  description <span>CHAR</span>(<span>32</span>),
  counter <span>integer</span>);

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> elements
  <span>SELECT</span> generate_series(<span>1</span>, <span>1e6</span>) <span>AS</span> <span>id</span>,
    md5(<span>random</span>():<span>:text</span>) <span>AS</span> description,
    <span>3</span> - <span>least</span>((<span>random</span>()*<span>3</span> + <span>1</span>):<span>:integer</span>, <span>2</span>) <span>as</span> counter;</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, I created two loops (one for each case) for performing the operation on a set of randomly selected records (about 630k).</p>
<h4 id="deleteupdate-method">DELETE/UPDATE method</h4>
<div><pre><code>DO
$$
<span>DECLARE</span> r <span>record</span>;
<span>BEGIN</span>
  <span>FOR</span> r <span>in</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span>
    (<span>SELECT</span> generate_series(<span>1</span>, <span>1e6</span>) <span>AS</span> x, (<span>random</span>() * <span>1e6</span>):<span>:integer</span> <span>AS</span> <span>id</span>) <span>as</span> ids
  <span>LOOP</span>
    <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> elements <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> = r.id <span>AND</span> counter = <span>1</span>;  <span>-- common case first!</span>

    <span>IF</span> <span>NOT</span> FOUND <span>THEN</span>
      <span>UPDATE</span> elements <span>SET</span> counter = counter - <span>1</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> = r.id;
    <span>END</span> <span>IF</span>;
  <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span>;
<span>END</span>
$$;</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="cursor-method">Cursor method</h4>
<div><pre><code>DO
$$
<span>DECLARE</span>
  r <span>record</span>;
  <span>value</span> <span>integer</span>;
  curs <span>CURSOR</span> <span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span> counter <span>FROM</span> elements <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> = r.id <span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>;
<span>BEGIN</span>
  <span>FOR</span> r <span>in</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>id</span> <span>FROM</span>
    (<span>SELECT</span> generate_series(<span>1</span>, <span>1e6</span>) <span>AS</span> x, (<span>random</span>() * <span>1e6</span>):<span>:integer</span> <span>AS</span> <span>id</span>) <span>as</span> ids
  <span>LOOP</span>
    <span>OPEN</span> curs;
    FETCH <span>FROM</span> curs <span>into</span> <span>value</span>;
    <span>IF</span> <span>value</span> &gt; <span>1</span> <span>THEN</span>
      <span>UPDATE</span> elements
        <span>SET</span> counter = counter - <span>1</span>
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>CURRENT</span> <span>OF</span> curs;
    <span>ELSE</span>
      <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> elements
        <span>WHERE</span> <span>CURRENT</span> <span>OF</span> curs;
    <span>END</span> <span>IF</span>;
    <span>CLOSE</span> curs;
  <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span>;
<span>END</span>
$$;</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="results">Results</h4>
<p>The results were not what I expected them to be. The delete/update method took 11.5s to run, whereas the cursor method took 15.0s. I also experimented with other compositions of the counter values that were less favourable to the delete/update method, but even then it beat the cursor method. Specifically, with 1/2/3 values composed in a 62.5%/25%/12.5% mix the delete/update method took 8.4s, whereas the cursor method took 13.4s. Even with 1/2/3 values composed in 25%/50%/25% mix the delete/update method took 10.9s, whereas the cursor method took 15.0s. These numbers come from a Xeon E5-2690 v4 CPU running at 2.60GHz with PostgreSQL 12.2 using a ZFS SSD disk.</p>
<p>To me the results demonstrate the blindingly fast record access speed that PostgreSQL can achieve. One might think that on storage media with worse performance the numbers could turn out different. Indeed, I saw the cursor method outperform the delete/update one on a Raspberry Pi with an SSD disk, and we can assume that rotational media would also perform badly. However, in realistic scenarios the performance of indices stored on magnetic disks would be boosted through ample RAM caching, which would diminish their disadvantage.</p>

	<section>
		<p><a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/my-time-travel-online-banking-experiment-part-i/"><em>Last week I introduced</em></a><em> you to Inteligo (online banking experience straight from 2001) and presented its brief story (... of permanent stagnation). Now we can smoothly transition into comparing it with "modern banking customer experience" (the one you know from any bank you're using these days) to assess the real value of banks' "digital transformation" propaganda ...</em></p><hr><p>Okay, so what did I learn out of this comparison?</p><p>First of all, it seems that <strong>my use cases</strong> for online banking services haven't changed AT ALL (and keep in mind that I do consider myself an early adopter of various novelties - I don't accept them uncritically, but I'm not afraid of experimenting). What is more, how I perform those use cases (e.g., check accounts history, make a money transfer, etc.) didn't change either! It's not faster. It doesn't involve fewer steps. The <strong>only major life-comfort improvements</strong> are about payment integrations, but those are visible on the merchant's side of transaction.</p><p>All the expensive ideas and experiments to make banking more <em>"social"</em> and <em>"engaged"</em> (e.g. via gamification, personal finance management, social media integrations) have failed miserably and got scrapped (because no-one wanted to use them) over the years.</p><p>Various <em>"visionaries"</em> and self-proclaimed <em>"digital prophets"</em> aimed to make banking more attractive and mix it with other, more appealing activities (in fact - to collect more data, open partnership opportunities, spur word of mouth marketing) - but they've all failed miserably.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because banking ain't <em>"sexy"</em>, and it will never be. Banking is a basic, low-level service of either keeping, saving, or lending money. Nothing more. Such a service has to be secure, stable, rock-solid, trustworthy, fast, and SIMPLE. It will never be <em>"attractive"</em> (people will not <em>"like"</em> it) - <strong>banks are not there to be liked</strong>.</p><p>Banks are an unpleasant necessity - no one uses online banking <em>"for fun"</em>. It's not money that brings joy, but what you spend that money on. The fact that there has to be a payment activity during the transaction is always an uncomfortable inconvenience - the goal is not to make it enjoyable (because it's impossible) but to reduce the annoyance (by limiting the exposure / making it transparent) to a minimum.</p><p>Security is probably the area with the most meaningful improvements (when it comes to online banking sites/apps), e.g.:</p><ul><li>inconvenient 2FA methods like scratch cards have been replaced with SMSes or in-app approval (like the one in iPKO's mobile app named IKO)</li><li>to avoid getting tricked by scammy, bank-look-alike fake sites, banks ask the user to set up a dedicated visual symbol (that acts as a tiny but unique personalization token) - it actually had been added by Inteligo a few years ago</li><li>mechanisms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure">3-D Secure</a> provide an additional layer of protection when it comes to card transactions securing (when initiated on merchant's site)</li></ul><p>I wouldn't call those a revolution, rather a set of point improvements, but they are still worth appreciating. Is the list long enough for almost 20 years of online systems evolution? I leave it to your judgment.</p><p>Okay, so I've already indicated that the use cases list didn't change and the same applies to how I perform them. But that's a bit of an over-simplification. In fact, there's <strong>a significant step back</strong>: in terms of UI clarity, cleanliness, and brevity.</p><p>Old Inteligo interface may be outdated and ugly, but it's <u>optimized for usage efficiency</u>, e.g.:</p><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/inteligo_1.png" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/inteligo_1.png 600w, https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/inteligo_1.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>No bloat. It's not pretty, but it's practical.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>I have pretty much everything within one click range from the main dashboard: history for the chosen account, a transfer to a pre-defined recipient, my cards, etc.</li><li>I can execute a transfer for the pre-defined recipient straight from the list (each row has an "amount" field for that purpose!); there's even an expected transaction date separately for each entity on the list</li></ul><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/inteligo_2.png" alt="" srcset="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/inteligo_2.png 600w"><figcaption>Transfers do not even require navigating to a new view</figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, more "modern" iPKO fails miserably in areas Inteligo does not. Wanna examples? Here we go!</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> does not work properly on the login page - the page does not correctly recognize automated content inject if you don't fiddle with the field's focus; I know LastPass is a 3rd party tool, but AFAIK it's one of the top 3 (with 1Password &amp; Keepass) and we're speaking about recommended security practices here ...</li><li>Instead of terms established in the customer's vocabulary (<em>"credit"</em>, <em>"loan"</em>, <em>"deposit"</em>, <em>"card"</em>) the navigation uses words from the bank's lingo/perspective (e.g., <em>"my products"</em> - a category where you have both loans and deposits stashed together ...)</li><li>The interface is generally <u>optimized for sales</u> (and it's screaming it!) - e.g., there's a shortcut to product categories, but it's pretty useless because it contains a non-interactive summary and ... yes, you've guessed right - for each category, an <em>"add new"</em> / <em>"buy more"</em> button; this may make sense for consumer goods in retail (tempting ...), but in banking?</li></ol><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/pkobp_1.png" alt=""><figcaption>"Otwórz", "Zamów", "Weź", ...</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, that's not the only piece of insolent sales-oriented bloat - if you haven't agreed to receive marketing communication, there'll always be a widget nagging you to change it; there's no direct button to your card operations/statement, but you can arrange a meeting with your sales advisor in just one click ;P (also on the main page). And obviously there are exposed, space-wasting icons (on the main screen ...) to all the offered services I've never ever used (like <em>"Automarket"</em>, <em>"Kantor"</em>, <em>"e-Urząd"</em>, etc.).</p><figure><img src="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/content/images/2020/12/pkobp_2.png" alt=""><figcaption>These are present all the time on the main page. Useless but consume useful space.</figcaption></figure><p>Hey, but banking ain't just about having a clean and informative user interface. Maybe banks in 2020 are ... smarter? Well, the 2nd most favorite buzzword in banking these days appears to be <em>"big data"</em> - what if banks actually use all that data to advise their customers better (provide more adequate product recommendations, emphasize contextual actions, etc.).</p><p>LOL, <strong>no they don't</strong>.</p><p>A <em>"modern banking"</em> story that has happened this month:</p><ol><li>My credit card got temporarily blocked because of a (legit) transaction from Singapore; I don't mind the fact it was blocked (I assume it was for security reasons), but I've only got an SMS message about that - UI didn't create any notification/reminder, generate any shortcut to deal with that situation (e.g., resolve blocked transaction) - I had to dig through few nested screens only to find out I need to call the helpline to unblock the card ;P</li><li>During my helpline conversation, I was offered a product - some sort of a cash loan; it seems smart for the bank to use every opportunity to sell, but ... it was ridiculous because of the amount of free funds I had for at least a quarter (deposit rates have plummeted, so I didn't open any investments) - more cash was actually the last thing I needed and any logical, automated recommendation system should easily reason that</li><li>After my kind rejection, I've got a proposal of raising my credit card limit - while in fact, I've never managed to reach more than 30% of my current limit ... Are they random-generating those offers?!</li></ol><p>Maybe I'm expecting too much (in terms of an advice)? Well, what about the very basic thing - <strong>visualizing the current account's balance history</strong> (to provide some graphical cues and insights)? This could present in a brief, clear way answers to some fundamental questions like:</p><ul><li>what was the minimum balance in 2020?</li><li>am I accumulating money, or does my expenditure exceed the income?</li><li>how much piggy-banking could I afford while keeping my balance safe? (with some fixed risk reserve)</li></ul><p>Believe it or not, I've found NO visualization AT ALL in the 2020's version of iPKO. Just raw, tabular data that I can export in a convenient format. Well, I know <em>spreadsheet-fu</em>, so I can do my own magic in Excel/Google Sheets - but it sounds like the first thing bank could support its customer with ... At least provide visual comparison of its offers (how much you can save with X and Y) ...</p><hr><p>The other example is all the digitized documents banks are attacking you with - regulations, policies, instructions. There's plenty of them, they are very long, and they do change quite frequently (so you get new versions as updates). A smart person could come with tons of ways to make them more approachable and ... truly useful (instead of cryptic). E.g.:</p><ul><li>summaries</li><li>stated purpose of a change</li><li>an option to visually compare previously accepted version with the new version (to focus on differences only instead of reading through 40 pages of legal jargon)</li><li>examples (especially for tariffs and calculations) + visualizations</li></ul><p>But no, nothing has ever improved in that area, while in the same time banks boast about <a href="https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/pko-bank-introduces-new-blockchain-system-2320">using blockchain to store the customer agreements</a>. How ridiculous is that? What kind of problem does it really solve?</p><p>However crazy it sounds: the bank straight from 2001 is AT LEAST as useful as the modern 2020 bank. At least (but maybe even more, because it's stripped of all the bloat). In contrast to boisterous announcements &amp; PR messages, the "digital revolution" in FinTech rarely goes beyond CSS replacement.</p><p>Yes, it may appear that all my reasoning's based on comparing Inteligo with iPKO. But AFAIR I had used online banking (at least a basic current account) in 6 polish banks since 2001 - NONE of them has introduced any feature/change/improvement that has <strong>meaningfully changed</strong> the way I save/use/spend/loan money. </p><p>Now compare it to other industries. Which of them could afford a nearly two decades long coma?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <p>I now have discovered the 100% correlation between me waking up earlier and the quality of work that I do.</p>
<p>Before this, I wasn’t certain. I knew that morning time helped me become better focused and gave me more time, but now I know for certain that the effects are much more profound.</p>
<h2>Traits that enable better quality</h2>
<h4>Distractions</h4>
<p>First off, the most impact in the morning has been achieved because I am focusing on one thing at a time and not constantly jumping from task to task or browser window to another one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43152412">multitasking is a big fat lie</a> that we got told by god knows who. We have been trying to improve and promote it while in reality, our brain doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>It works by focusing on one thing and one thing only. Multitasking is a synonym to being <strong>distracted</strong>.</p>
<p>This knowledge has been in the hands of influenced people from 1700s, and since then somehow, we are in the world of constant distractions and multitasks.</p>
<p>Every device and app is trying to grab our attention. Of course they are, their business model depends on it. While this means that the quality of the app must be addictive, it damages our pattern of work and life, which leads to lower productivity.</p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>Around 3 months ago, I fully turned off any notifications that I could possibly get. I turned off phone notifications. I turned off any notification on my laptop. Not spearing anything.</p>
<p>This allows me sometimes to work on a task for 1 hour to 2 hours with no distractions what so ever. </p>
<p>If someone urgently requires my attention, they can call me. Otherwise, it means that their problem was not important enough for me to react to immediately. Why is that important? </p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43152412">solving a particular task</a>, takes an approximate of 20 minutes. If you are doing the task for 5 minutes before jumping to another task, you are never doing deep and meaningful tasks.</li>
<li>Depp work or flow state can only be achieved by single-tasking. There is no way to achieve the highest quality of work whilst you are constantly distracted. The flow state has been shown to be the new huge hack that every scientist is working on perfecting. Get on the trend early by focusing on one task at a time.</li>
<li>The more you multitask, the higher your stress levels will be. Stress and anxiety have been <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pms.1999.88.2.409">directly linked</a> with lower creativity, happiness and productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution? </p>
<p>When you are working, put your phone as far away or in the drawer on silent.</p>
<p>Train your brain and body to stop craving the quick dopamine fixes from the social media while you are doing deep and meaningful work.</p>
<p>Make sure that your brain understands how you can go about achieving the flow state, <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/impact-through-motion">do</a> <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/what-writing-can-do">extra</a> <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/not-having-structure-ship">research</a>.</p>
<h2>Multitasking is dead</h2>
<p>You might be surprised, but the idea of multitasking is no longer relevant. Anyone who has been a multitasker has either burned out and is no longer promoting it, or have been in the productivity dump ever since they started to multitask.</p>
<p>Our brain is wired to accept information in a deep and meaningful way. This is because we have to be in the moment to achieve the highest levels of concentration to survive.</p>
<p>Think of multitasking this way:</p>
<p>Would you want to check your iPhone notification whilst hunting a tiger? Probably not, because you might get killed while you are distracted. Well, that is why our brain is trained to achieve. It gives you a way to hunt the tigers, but instead you <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/the-world-doesnt-stop-when-you-are-tired">go around chasing chickens</a>.</p>
<p>Stop distracting yourself and try separating yourself from buzz technology and doing deep, meaningful work. You won’t regret it.</p>
<p>Start Now. Get perfect later.</p>

<p>Data Lakes are the de facto ways for companies and teams to collect and store the data in a central place for BI, Machine learning, reporting or other data intensive use-cases. In all approaches, starting with the traditional Data Lakes or the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html" target="_blank">Lakehouse</a> vision that takes over the data scene; or new contenders like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html" target="_blank">Data Mesh</a> concepts are all based on Data Lakes with proper access control. It’s very rare, that everyone, including vendors and third-parties have full access to every dataset in an organization, therefore creating fine-grained access control is fundamental to any data strategy. Based on projects with our customers and partners, we felt the need of a detailed description of how to design and implement this fine-grained access control with Azure Data Lake Gen2 and how to use it from Azure Databricks. In this blogpost, we will implement a solution to allow access to an Azure Data Lake Gen2 from our clusters in Azure Databricks. The solution uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) and credential passthrough to grant adequate access to different parts of the company.</p>



<h2>1. Use-case description</h2>



<p>Let’s suppose we have an Azure Data Lake Gen2 with the following folder structure. The Data Lake is created in a separate storage account in a standalone container. Remember, when provisioning a storage account, we need to enable hierarchical namespace under the advanced tab. This way, the result is an Azure Data Lake Gen2 and not a “simple” Azure Blob Storage. The gold/silver/bronze layers come from the <a href="https://delta.io/">Delta Lake</a> architecture.</p>

<p>Let’s also suppose we have three different teams working with this Data Lake, one Data Engineering and two Data Science:</p>



<ul><li><em>Data Engineering Team</em>: responsible for the transformation, transition and integrity of data for all layers.</li><li><em>Data Science – Finance Team</em>: responsible for analysing financial data in the gold table and drawing conclusions or develop machine learning models based on the data.</li><li><em>Data Science – Manufacturing Team</em>: responsible for analysing manufacturing data in the gold table and drawing conclusions or develop machine learning models based on the data.</li></ul>







<p>Note, that the Data Engineering team should have access to all folders in the Data Lake. On the other hand, Data Science Finance should only have access to the finance folder (and its sub-folders) within the gold layer. Similarly, Data Science Manufacturing is only supposed to access files and folders within gold/manufacturing.</p>



<p>For every company, it is of crucial importance to have the right access control. This way, only those people may have access to sensitive pieces of information whose work require them so. For instance, in our use-case, Data Science Manufacturing does not have access to any raw or finance related data. Why certain teams have no access to a specific type of dataset can come from various sources. Compliance, regulatory reasons, privacy reasons and many other reasons. We can make sure that teams have access to only the datasets they need in the form they can access it. For instance, we can remove personally identifiable information (PII) from the datasets accessible to Data Science teams, so our data platform adheres to GDPR or other data privacy regulations. They have access to those and only those tables that are needed for their work, but not other datasets.</p>



<h2>2. What is a credential passthrough? RBAC vs. ACL.</h2>



<p>So far, we have discussed the structure of our Data Lake and the what teams we have. Furthermore, we have talked about which team should have access to which parts of the Data Lake. Now, let’s discuss how access control can be implemented in Microsoft Azure.</p>



<p>To understand credential passthrough, we, first, need to understand how Azure Databricks authenticates us when logging in and how this is connected to our access in the Data Lake. When logging into an Azure Databricks workspace, we are logged in via Azure Active directory. We are required to provide our Azure credentials and system takes care of the rest. The point is, that when logged into Databricks, it knows our AAD identity.</p>



<p>Now, we need to grant access to AAD identities in the Data Lake as well. As soon as this is done, the connection is there. The same AAD identity has access to Databricks and Data Lake as well. Therefore, Databricks can access Data Lake via the AAD identity. Credential passthrough is the process of using your AAD account (that you used to log into Databricks) to assess whether the user can read or write the data in our Data Lake.</p>



<p>There are two separate concepts of access control in Azure Data Lake Gen2: <strong>R</strong>ole <strong>B</strong>ased <strong>A</strong>ccess <strong>C</strong>ontrol (RBAC) and <strong>A</strong>ccess <strong>C</strong>ontrol <strong>L</strong>ist (ACL).</p>



<p>Using RBAC, access can only be granted to the whole of the resource. There is no such option of fine-tuning who has access to which folder. Once the RBAC access is granted, the user shall have access to the whole of the Azure Storage Account. Depending on which role is set for us (read/write etc.), we may have different rights though, through the different user roles. Read more about built-in Azure roles <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles">here</a>. RBAC may be set in the Azure Portal in the resource page under Access Control (IAM) → Role Assignments.</p>



<p>On the other hand, with ACL, it is possible to give folder-level access to users. This way it is possible to fine-tune who has access to which folder and what it can do (read or write or both). To use ACL, download the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/">desktop version of Azure Storage Explorer</a>. As of the day of publishing this post, it is in preview mode in the Azure Portal. We recommend using the desktop version as currently it has more features than the portal version. More specifically, with the Storage Explorer we can setup ACL on the container root, which is very important as we will need to assign execute permission to every user on the container level. However, in case your prefer managing your resources via the Azure CLI, we suggest reading <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-cli">this article</a> on how to setup ACLs in Azure Data Lake Gen2 programmatically. We will detail access types in the next section.</p>



<p>RBAC and ACL can be used together. This decision chart illustrates how the decision of access is made. Note, that if a user has RBAC access, ACL access is not even evaluated. Therefore, ACL cannot be used to restrict access for users with RBAC permissions.</p>



<figure><img src="https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/RBAC.png" alt="" width="717" height="817" srcset="https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/RBAC.png 795w, https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/RBAC-561x640.png 561w, https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/RBAC-768x876.png 768w, https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/RBAC-700x799.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px"><figcaption><em>Source: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In our use-case, we intend to restrict access to several folders for both Data Science teams. Consequently, we need to implement an ACL based architecture, without using RBAC.</p>



<h2>3. AAD Groups and related ADLS Gen2 accesses</h2>



<p>So far, we have covered</p>



<ul><li>the Data Lake folder structure</li><li>which team should access to which folder</li><li>concepts of access control</li></ul>



<p>Now, let’s discuss ACLs in detail and what Azure Active Directory identities to provision.</p>



<h3>3.a Permission types</h3>



<p>There are three permission types: Write, Execute, Read. The below table summarizes what they mean in the context of an Azure Data Lake Gen2.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Write (W)</td><td>Can write or append to a file</td><td>Requires&nbsp;Write&nbsp;and&nbsp;Execute&nbsp;to create child items in a directory</td></tr><tr><td>Execute (X)</td><td>Does not mean anything in the context of Data Lake Storage Gen2</td><td>Required to traverse the child items of a directory</td></tr><tr><td>Read (R)</td><td>Can read the contents of a file</td><td>Requires&nbsp;Read&nbsp;and&nbsp;Execute&nbsp;to list the contents of the directory</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>After learning about different levels of permission, we must realize why it is of crucial importance to have at least execute access on the container root. Without that, we are not able to access any folders even though we do have access to those folders.</p>



<p>There is an option of inheritance of permissions to child folders. However, inheritance settings must be applied before creating a child folders. This option is to be found as <em>default</em> in the Azure Storage Explorer.</p>



<p>This is an example of how ACL settings look like in the explorer. To set ACL for a directory (or) container root, right click on the folder/container root and choose <em>manage access.</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled.png" alt="" srcset="https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled.png 970w, https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-640x149.png 640w, https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-768x179.png 768w, https://datapao.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-700x163.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px"></figure>



<p>There is a limited number of AAD identities that we can grant ACL access. To be precise, this limitation applies to every file and folder. This means we can only have a maximum of 32 entities associated with a single folder or file.</p>



<p>For a detailed description of ACLs, we suggest reading <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control">this article</a> from Microsoft.</p>



<h3>3.b AAD identities</h3>



<p>To tackle the problem of ACL access limitations and to ease future administration, we are going to group AAD users together to an AAD group and grant access to the group. The AAD group counts as 1 AAD identity. Therefore, we are not using as many free slots as we would have by granting access to each individual AAD user, and any further user will be part of a group that has access to the root, helping with the administration. It is important to note, that AAD groups can be grouped together. It is often the case that all members of an AAD group are other AAD groups. Well, this can get extremely messy and complicated if we are not careful or we don’t have a clear plan on how to structure the groups. However, making the right AAD choices is incredibly important.</p>



<p>Now, let’s apply the knowledge with our use-case to build the right structure of AAD identities.</p>



<ul><li><em>Everyone</em> should have execute (possibly read) access to the container root. Write access should not be granted in order to save the …</li></ul></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Bucharest will host the European Cybersecurity Competence Center, a future hub to distribute EU and national funding for cybersecurity research projects across the bloc, after the majority of EU countries voted for it on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The city was selected from a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1543741">list of seven vying to host the center</a>, including Brussels, Munich, Warsaw, Vilnius, Luxembourg and León in Spain. </p>
<p>Diplomats selected Bucharest with 15 votes in its favor, several EU diplomats said, in a second round of votes that pitted Brussels against Romania's capital.</p>

<p>"Hub for high tech and innovation, featuring a thriving digital ecosystem, dynamic and young, Romania’s capital will take this task in a responsible and dedicated manner, to the benefit of the entire European Union," Romania's permanent representation to the EU <a href="https://twitter.com/romaniaineu/status/1336801063865880577" target="_blank">tweeted</a> after the vote.</p>
<p>The center’s core job will be to manage cybersecurity funds from the EU’s research budgets, including about €2 billion earmarked in its Digital Europe program and many millions more via innovation funding and coronavirus recovery funds, in addition to national contributions. The bloc is still finalizing its long-term budget for 2021-2027. </p>
<p>The center will not be a formal EU agency but is expected to bring dozens of jobs to Bucharest — about 30 to start, and up to 80 according to some estimates. It should also help boost business for local cybersecurity companies and burnish the host country’s reputation on cyber.</p>
<p>Romania doesn't yet host an EU agency, which played in its favor. It also ranks third in EU statistics on women employees in information and communications technology (ICT) and 24 percent of ICT graduates in Romania are women, the country's bid book <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-race-to-host-the-eus-cyber-competence-center/">said</a>.&nbsp;National capitals have also been wary to put the center in Brussels — close to the EU's main institutions — because of fears that this would erode national competence over security issues. </p>
<p>The European Commission, Parliament and Council are still finalizing the details of how the center will be governed. An agreement on a new law establishing the center is expected to be struck before the end of the year, and negotiators will meet this Friday to try to clinch a deal. </p>

But before we are ready to apply any statistical method we of course need the data and for doing so, we need to ask ourselves questions like:</p><blockquote><p id="7c69">What input is required?</p><p id="75eb">Who is going to perform the simulation?</p><p id="a35c">What facilities are going to be used?</p><p id="93ec">Where is the resulting data going to be stored?</p><p id="6091">How to access the available data?</p></blockquote><p id="6fb9">Physical simulations usually require intricate input that takes into consideration several aspects and parameters used by different models to approximate the phenomena under consideration. Also, scientific simulations are computationally demanding tasks, so they are usually run in (inter)national supercomputers or very specialized facilities. We also want to maximize the impact of the data in the scientific community, therefore we want other scientists to be able to access the data and even add their own, but we need some security layers to protect such valuable data.</p><p id="bcb8">There is no silver bullet to address all the previous questions, but there are amazing initiatives like the <a href="https://foldingathome.org/" rel="noopener">folding at home project</a> that distributes some computational tasks among volunteers around the world who give away some time in their computers to simulate protein dynamics.</p><p id="6858">It seems that if we want to collaborate on the distribution of computational tasks and the assemblage of the resulting data, we need a central “entity” that (1) allows users to request new tasks, (2) receives the task’s results to be stored and (3) returns some available data when requested. It sounds like we need a web service!</p><blockquote><p id="6a2b">Writing a web service is a nontrivial task, you need to be aware of different technologies, libraries, etc. while making sure that your data is going to be safe and of course you need some infrastructure to host your service. This post goal is to give you some hints about building a web service for scientific applications and it is by no means a complete guide to writing web applications.</p></blockquote><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/9662/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ" width="4831" height="3221" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*HnAn4y-BQGmvGjGZ?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@johnschno?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">John Schnobrich</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p id="a44e">Before entering into the web service technical details, let’s explore what its behavior should be.</p><p id="74cc">So, once it has been decided what are the best approximations and models to perform the simulations, we can compile all the simulation metadata into different jobs. For instance, a job can be a single molecular simulation under some specific conditions. We would like to make all these jobs available to the users, in such a way that they can run one or more jobs at a time but avoiding that the same job is run by more than one user.</p><p id="2b33">It would be great that when the simulation is done a user can send the results to the web service or ask for already available results. We also want to be able to call the web service from our local computer, specialized infrastructure or wherever we want to perform the computation, without worrying about where the service is running.</p><p id="be30">It seems, that we want a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" rel="noopener">Git</a>-like behavior where we can pull jobs (or available data) and push results.</p><p id="ba78">With these requirements in mind, I have developed an open source web service called <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server" rel="noopener">Insilico-server</a>.

First, you need to define a schema using the <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> schema language. The following code snippet defines a schema to query a job using its status,</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Schema definition for job query</figcaption></figure><p id="2045">The <strong>Query</strong> schema specifies that in order to request some <strong><em>jobs</em></strong> you need to provide a <em>Status</em> argument, where <em>Status</em> can be one of four possibilities: <em>AVAILABLE, DONE, FAILED</em> and <em>RUNNING. </em>The exclamation mark (!) indicates that the argument cannot be <em>Null</em> (a.k.a <em>None</em> in Python).</p><p id="5870">The following <strong>Mutation</strong> schema defines the required arguments to update a given job status.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>Schema definitation for Job status mutation</figcaption></figure><p id="9dd2">The <strong><em>updateJob</em></strong> action specifies that you must provide an <em>id</em> and a <em>new_status</em> in order to be able to update a job. You will receive a <em>Reply</em> specifying whether the update action has succeeded.</p><p id="54d3">Have a look at the Insilico <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/sdl/Query.graphql" rel="noopener">queries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/sdl/Mutation.graphql" rel="noopener">mutations</a> schemas. They are slightly more complex than the aforementioned schemas but follow the same rationale as the previous examples. You can also have a look at the official <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/" rel="noopener">introduction to GraphQL</a>.</p><p id="33f0">We have just defined the schemas that specify the actions that we want to perform. We still need to implement the actions and for doing so, we need a GraphQL engine: a library that takes the schemas together with the code that implements the actions and generates an API.</p><p id="39ea">We have chosen the <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette GraphQL engine</a> to implement our web service mostly because it is easy to use and open source. The following snippet shows a possible implementation for querying jobs based on their status using <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette</a>.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="affa">the <strong><em>Resolver</em></strong> decorator indicates that the <strong><em>resolver_query_jobs</em></strong> function corresponds to the implementation of the <strong><em>query jobs</em></strong> schema. The function takes 4 arguments of which I only use <strong><em>args</em></strong> and <strong><em>ctx</em></strong><em> </em>(You can refer to <a href="https://tartiflette.io/" rel="noopener">Tartiflette</a> for further details). <strong><em>args </em></strong>contains the arguments given by the client code, while <strong><em>ctx </em></strong>contains the context for running the current function, for example the handler to access the database that is called <strong><em>mongodb</em></strong> in this code snippet.</p><p id="9242">Notice that the definition of the aforementioned function starts with the <em>async</em> keyword. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="noopener">Asyncio</a> is a popular built-in Python library to write concurrent code. It is extensively used to write high performance web services.</p><p id="fb0a">In the Insilico web service implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/tree/master/provisioning" rel="noopener"><strong>queries</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/nlesc-nano/insilico-server/blob/master/insilicoserver/mutation_resolvers.py" rel="noopener"><strong>mutations</strong></a>, there are definitions for all the Python functions that perform the actions specified in the GraphQL schemas. For each query and mutation, there is a corresponding function.</p><p id="632b">We need a database not only for storing the interesting data but also to store the jobs metadata, like what jobs are available. For the Insilico web service we use <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a>.</p><p id="1b90">My personal opinion is that a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" rel="noopener">NoSQL database</a> like <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" rel="noopener">MongoDB</a> gives a significant advantage over traditional SQL databases on research projects where up-front design of the schemas to store data is unfeasible. The research priorities can change as the project evolves and having dynamic …</p></div></div></section></div>

December 10, 2020 | https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-09-sugar-compiler-pt2.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-09-sugar-compiler-pt2.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/index.html">(home)</a> <span>2020-12-09</span><p>
<span>(This is a follow up post to my first one about my wasm-targeting language, <code>sugar</code> <a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html">/blog/2020-12-06-sugar-compiler.html</a>
)</span></p><p>I've taken some of my <em>future directions</em> topics from the previous post and expanded on them. I'll be describing those in this post.
</p>
<span>Since this compiler doesn't keep track of types, there are (will be) variants of many functions for specific types. I intend to use i32 and unsigned as the default for the functions without suffix and provide suffixed versions for all the types.</span><p>Note: The new compiler (common lisp) source code is in
<a href="https://ph1lter.bitbucket.io/src/sugar.pt2">/src/sugar.pt2</a>
</p>
<h2> shortcut and/or</h2>
<p>Lisp, and many languages, have <em>so-called</em> shortcutting and/or operators. These operators only evaluate the <em>minimum</em> set of
their arguments required to decide on the true/false result.
</p>
<p>This feature can be very useful for guarding function calls.
</p>
<p>In this example if some-val is <code>nil</code> then
<code>and</code> will get false for the first argument. Since <code>and</code> is false if <em>any</em> argument is false <code>and</code> will now <em>shortcut</em>
and return false. It will not evaluate
<code>(never-do-this-with-nil some-val)</code>, and that's good since <code>never-do-this-with-nil</code> would probably crash if called with nil.
</p>
<pre>(and some-val (never-do-this-with-nil some-val))
</pre>
<p>One can imagine a language treating <code>and</code> as a purely, mathematical, boolean, function. That language would first evaluate all arguments,
just like it does with any function, and then call the function to get true/false.
</p>
<p>So how do these shortcut and/or operators actually work, if they are not functions? They compile to nested if-expressions, not a function call at all.
</p>
<h3> and</h3>
<p>Here is an example of how <code>and</code> is compiled:
</p>
<pre>(and a b c)
=&gt;
(if a (if b c false) false)
</pre>
<p>We see that this and evaluates to false or 'c' (here we are using the concept that 0 is false and everything else is true, like C and Lisp*.
It's called a <em>generalized boolean</em> in Lisp).
So the total <code>and</code> expression will either return false or the value of 'c' (which may be false) and will stop evaluating arguments
after the first one returning false.
</p>
<p>You may also notice the <em>recursive</em> nature of the transformation:
</p>
<pre>(and a _) =&gt; (if a _ false)
(and x) =&gt; x
</pre>
<p>We can implement <code>and</code> as a lisp macro, that is, a function transforming a piece of sugar syntax/code "(and a b c)" into another
piece of sugar syntax/code "(if a ....)". (more on macros in an upcoming post). We can also make use of the recursive nature of the
transformation to implement the macro function.
</p>
<p><span>Yes, sugar has macros, but so far they are only accessible to the compiler itself, internally, not user code.</span>
</p>
<h3> or</h3>
<p>Can we perform the same trick with <code>or</code>? Yes, almost; there is a complication.
</p>
<p>To get the full Lisp-effect of and/or I would like to return the value of the final expression evaluated, not just 0 or 1 (true or false),
and this causes a problem (but the trouble is, I think, worth it).
</p>
<pre>(or a b c)
=&gt;
(if a a (if b b c))
</pre>
<p>Maybe you can see the problem? I need to check the value of 'a', but then I need to return 'a' if it's not false (non-zero). In the case of
a real use of <code>or</code> 'a' might be something complex e.g. a function call which sends $200 to your bank account. If that call returns
true, I will then <em>call it again</em> when returning it from the <code>if</code>, thus sending you a further $200, which I had not intended.
My code looks like this
<span>(yes, send-200-dollars must return false if it succeeds; awkward example)</span></p>
<pre>(or (overdrawn?) (send-200-dollars) (print-failure))
</pre>
<p>But transformed to this, where you potentially get 2 calls to either of the first 2 functions.
</p>
<pre>(if (overdrawn?) (overdrawn?) (if (send-200-dollars) (send-200-dollars) (print-failure)))
</pre>
<p>Formally, this is a problem with any functions which have <em>side-effects</em>. The functions used in and/or <em>must</em> return a (generalized) boolean,
but they are also allowed to have interesting side-effects.
</p>
<p>This ability to have side-effects in and/or is a powerful Lisp feature and can be used to write some, nice, concise code.
So we want to have it in sugar.
</p>
<p>The solution is to evaluate each argument at most once and capture the result in a variable. In a Lisp macro we would do this with
<code>let</code> which allows introducing new scopes and variables anywhere, but wat/wasm (and hence sugar) only allow locals to be defined
at the start of a function.
</p>
<p>We'd have to ask the user to remember to define <code>and-or-helper-var</code> in every function using and/or. That would be awkward.
</p>
<p>The compromise solution I've made is to have a single <em>hidden global</em> variable which is used by the macro expanding <code>or</code>.
This should be safe, even for nested and/or constructs since the capture is only required after the true condition and no other code
can be evaluated before its use
<span>(fingers crossed I haven't missed something)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we have this recursive definition for <code>or</code>.
<span>(progn is just Lisp's way of sequencing expressions/statements. Like a {} block in C.)</span></p>
<pre>(or a _) =&gt; (progn (set T a) (if T T _))
(or x) =&gt; x
</pre>
<p>Here we can see an example of the use of returning values in and/or rather than just 0/1.
</p>
<pre>(set r (or (this-maybe-good?) (what-about-this?) (last-chance-value)))
</pre>
<p>Each of these functions returns a different value and 'r' will end up containing the actual value decided upon.
</p>
<span>There is a further complication. <code>wat/wasm</code> requires a special (result type) clause on <code>if</code> when we want to return a value from the branches, but this section is way too long already. See vprogn/vif below.</span><h2> loops: while/forever (break and continue)</h2>
<p>I've added 2 new loop forms. Mostly just to test my internal macro system.
</p>
<pre>(while condition body...)
(forever body...)
; example with break
(forever
  ...
  (if some-case (break))
  ...)
</pre>
<p>The forever loop requires <code>break</code>. So I've implemented <code>break, break-if &amp; continue</code>. Normally wat/wasm requires
explicit labels for such things, but I generate labels in the compiler and keep them on a stack, so <code>break, break-if &amp; continue</code>
can take the inner-most label from the stack (optionally you can specify explicit labels, to allow breaking out of multiple
loop levels). <code>break-if</code> could be written as
<code>(if condition (break))</code> but wat/wasm has a special <code>br_if</code> instruction and <code>break-if</code> compiles to that as an optimization.
</p>
<p><code>break, break-if &amp; continue</code> can be used in <code>while &amp; for</code> too, tho <code>continue</code> won't update the counter in <code>for</code>
yet.
</p>
<h2> value versions of if/progn</h2>
<p>Thought for future: Maybe I should make counterparts to progn/if (vprogn/vif) which return values and drop the current <em>optional</em> result clause approach?
Chose (if) when returning nothing from the branches and (vif) (or vif.f64 etc.) when using value-if.
</p>
<h2> aref/aset</h2>
<p>Array access currently requires adding an index to a base pointer and then using (set*) or (get*) [or a typed variant thereof] and also
remembering to multiply the index by 2,4 or 8 depending on the size of the array element i32/i64/f32/f64.
</p>
<p>It would be nice to have Lisp's <code>aref</code> to do this for us.
</p>
<p>Again I have to compromise here. Since sugar doesn't track types, I cannot know the element size in the compiler. The user
must give it explicitly. As usual, I default to assuming i32 elements i.e. multiplier = 4.
</p>
<p>This gives the following syntax:
</p>
<pre>(aref ptr idx multiplier)
(aset ptr idx value mutiplier)
or
(aref ptr idx)
(aset ptr idx value)
</pre>
<p>Example
</p>
<pre>(print (aref num-table i))
(aset num-table i new-value)
(print (aref sin-lut i 8))
(aset sin-lut i (sin.f64 0.1231) 8)
</pre>
<p>This multiplier requirement is not ideal, but I still think I can write interesting code with sugar despite this lack.
</p>
<p>Later I plan to implement the <code>setf</code> macro which allows dropping the <code>aset</code> operator, by inferring it from the inner <code>aref</code>.
</p>
<pre>(aset ptr idx val)
=&gt;
(setf (aref ptr idx) val)
</pre>
<h2> defconstant</h2>
<p>While we <em>can</em> define immutable globals in wat/wasm, they do, in fact, take up space in the final .wasm file.
It would be useful to be able to define compile-time constants which are symbolically replaced during compilation and don't
actually appear as memory objects in the final output .wasm code.
</p>
<p>Lisp uses (defconstant) for this concept and I will too.
</p>
<pre>(defconstant var type val)
; example
(defconstant pi f64 3.14159) ;; useful in case the value of pi should ever change
</pre>
<p>I wanted to have constant-folding in the value argument but that's quite a big request for a compiler as simple as sugar.
I thought to cheat and use common-lisp's <code>eval</code> but that only allows the simplest sugar syntax like plus and multiply
and, importantly, it will not <em>see</em> any of the other <code>defconstant</code>'s defined in the code. So, for now, <code>defconstant</code>
requires literal, numeric, values.
</p>
<h2> miscellaneous operators</h2>
<p>Lots of basic math operators were missing from the original sugar compiler code. I've added quite a few, but even more are still missing.
</p>
<ul><li>
set*/get* - I've added a complete set of type variants such as set.i64*, with default set* being i32, as usual.
</li><li>
return/nop - return being the more useful, allows immediate exit from a function, with optional value.
</li><li>
relational operators: =,&lt;,&gt;,&lt;= etc. Only the i32 versions (unsigned variant where sign is relevant).
</li><li>
nil, t - predefined constants for 0/1
</li><li>
(coerce value i32 i64) - allows truncating cast from i64 to i32; compiles to i32.wrap_i64 only for now.
</li><li>
(i64 number) - allows defining i64 constants; compiles to (i64.const number)
</li></ul>

They do not tire like humans often do when faced with crunching mathematical equations over and over again. Further, given decent hardware, a computer can execute several mathematical operations in a matter of milliseconds – which is far beyond what the normal human is capable of.</p><p>What does all this mean for you as a game developer, though? It means that things like procedural generation are possible to add variety to your games – as computers are more than capable of generating a level on the fly in seconds! In this tutorial, we are going to show you how to harness this aspect of computers to procedurally generate a maze level before runtime. We will be using C# and Unity to explore not only the details of the C# data structure, but also a handy programming trick called “recursion.” We’re going to be looking at how an ancient math problem can help us build this maze generating tool.</p><p>Because of this, it is recommended that you have some familiarity with Unity and programming in C#. This could be considered an Intermediate to Advanced tutorial. However, I will be explaining everything in detail so if you are not completely confident in your C# skills, simply follow along anyway.

This section will be adapted from and inspired by the book <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Advanced_Topics_in_C/T54QAwAAQBAJ"><em>Advanced Topics in C</em></a> by Noel Kalicharan – so if you’d like more details go check that book out. Here, however, I will strive to explain this topic in a more condensed, bite-sized form to suit our purposes.</p><p>If you wanted to write some code that would generate a maze for you, how would you start? Figuring out where to start can be extremely helpful for a problem such as this, mostly because it is likely a solution has already been found and we simply need to search it up. When it comes to maze creation, there are a couple of different approaches. Certain approaches worth mentioning might be having a computer generate an image texture that consists of white and black spaces that form the outline of a maze. Then we simply spawn a wall at either a black or white space (whichever color represents a wall). This method may be a bit easier to visualize but it would be a bit more difficult to write out in code.</p><p>The approach we are taking is a more mathematical approach. You might think of it as the “Recursive Method.” When we think about mazes (as in, how they are made), we can see there is a pattern to them, namely, there is a certain set of steps that, if executed exactly, will always solve the maze. Think of it like this: if you’re placed in a maze and you have no prior knowledge about how it was constructed (i.e., no map or “birds-eye view”), you could finish the maze by simply noting where you can’t go (i.e., where a wall is) and where you can go (i.e. where an empty spot is). Assume you’ve got a way to keep track of all the places you can and can’t go, then it’s a relatively simple task of checking each spot that you can go to. Eventually, you’ll end up at the exit.</p><p>Now that probably doesn’t sound like a very solid plan if you’re stuck in a maze. It would take much too long to check each possible path. Naturally, we would get quite tired if we attempted this strategy. But a computer wouldn’t get tired. As we’ve said before, a computer can execute the exact same task over and over again with much more precision and much more speed. Here’s where we can use that aspect to solve our problem. Here’s where the subject of recursion comes into play.</p><p>In computer science, “recursion” is where a method or function is defined in terms of itself. A way it sometimes crops up is when a method calls itself. This would put the method into a sort of infinite loop. Usually, some condition is set up inside of the method that prevents it from being called an infinite amount of times (it wouldn’t be particularly useful if that was the case). To illustrate the usefulness of this method, we can turn to the classic example of the Towers of Hanoi, a puzzle game with simple rules. It involves a number of disks (let’s say 3), those same disks on a number of poles (let’s say 3 again), and two rules: 1) you can only move one disk (the disk on top) and 2) you can’t put a larger disk on top of a smaller one.</p><p><img src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1.png" alt="An illustration of the tower puzzle" width="573" height="241" srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1.png 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" data-srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1.png 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1-300x126.png 300w" data-src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1.png.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1.png.webp 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic1-1-300x126.png.webp 300w"></p><p>How would you go about moving the entire stack of disks to another pole while abiding by those rules? The answer isn’t intuitively obvious and I certainly wouldn’t be one to give you an answer right off the bat. Nevertheless, we can write a recursive function that would solve this for us. Further, we can write a program that could solve much larger puzzles than three discs and three poles.</p><p>Let’s have a look at the solution to this particular puzzle. Let’s assume we know how to move the top two disks to pole B by using poles B and C.</p><p><img src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2.png" alt="Moving the top two disks to B" width="573" height="241" srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2.png 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" data-srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2.png 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2-300x126.png 300w" data-src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2.png.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2.png.webp 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic2-300x126.png.webp 300w"></p><p>We could then move the third disk to C and (assuming we can move the top two as we did before) we can move the top two disks on top of the third on C.</p><p><img src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3.png" alt="Moving the bottom disk to C and the top two to C" width="573" height="241" srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3.png 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" data-srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3.png 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3-300x126.png 300w" data-src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3.png.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3.png.webp 573w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphic3-300x126.png.webp 300w"></p><p>The actual specifics of how we did the intermediate steps are not particularly complicated. Based on this solution, we can abstract this process to design a recursive algorithm to solve this puzzle. Notice that we did the following:</p><ul><li>Moved n-1 disks from A to B using C</li><li>Moved the nth disk from A to C</li><li>Moved n-1 disks from B to C by using A</li></ul><p>(in this case, n = 3)</p><p>Writing this in code looks like this:</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta --><div id="crayon-5fd4f42c5a8a7267707674" data-settings=" minimize scroll-mouseover"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>void</span><span> </span><span>Hanoi</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>n</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pole </span><span>start</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pole </span><span>end</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>pole </span><span>intermediate</span><span>)</span></p><p><span>{</span></p><p><span> </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span></p><p><span> </span><span>{</span></p><p><span> </span><span>Hanoi</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span> </span>-<span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>start</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>intermediate</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span> </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"Moved disk from "</span><span> </span>+<span> </span><span>start</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span> </span>+<span> </span><span>" to "</span><span> </span>+<span> </span><span>end</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span> </span><span>Hanoi</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span> </span>-<span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>intermediate</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>end</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>start</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p><span> </span><span>}</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div> <!-- [Format Time: 0.0007 seconds] --><p>Assume that “pole” is a previously defined object that has a string attribute called “name”. Notice that this method calls itself twice. In each case, it goes to the n – 1 disk until n = 0 at which point the method becomes invalid.</p><p>I hope you can see a way we can do something similar to generate a maze. Let’s assume a starting point and that it has four sides with either a wall or an open space in each spot. We could check if there’s a wall and record it as not being a walkable space. We could check if there’s an open space and record it as being a walkable space. Starting off with a set number of columns and rows (basically the size of the maze in x and y coordinates) we can then do a final check to make sure we haven’t gone past either of those boundaries. If there’s a walkable space adjacent to the point we are currently at, we can move to that spot and repeat the process all over again. It may sound like we’re trying to solve a maze rather than generate one but, when you consider it more closely, those two activities are essentially the same.</p><p>Before we close out this section and begin coding, I hope you realize another important aspect of recursive functions namely, that they are not the most efficient when it comes to memory or processing power. Naturally, if we have a maze with very large boundaries, it will take a good deal longer to generate than one that is half the size. Keep this in mind if you intend to use this technique in your own projects (as I sure hope you do).</p><h3><span id="Building_the_Base_Class"></span>Building the Base Class<span></span></h3><p>Let’s be programming optimists. Let’s assume that our code is going to work (every programmer’s dream) and that we’ll add more algorithms and techniques to this maze generator. Since we’re behaving as optimists, we can take a more abstract route when it comes to constructing our classes. Before we start coding, let’s get a plan as to how we should structure our classes. I propose the following data structure:</p><p><img src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2.png" alt="A graph explaining how the classes will be setup" width="600" height="921" srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2.png 600w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2-195x300.png 195w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-srcset="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2.png 600w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2-195x300.png 195w" data-src="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2.png.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2.png.webp 600w, https://coding.degree/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Graphci2-195x300.png.webp 195w"></p><p>We can feed the base class some information about the characteristics of a maze cell and the dimensions of that maze. The base class will then take that data, format it to prevent any out-of-range errors, and set up some abstract methods to be implemented by the algorithm class. The algorithm class is where we can put, among other things, our recursion algorithm to generate the maze. This class will run through the algorithm and spit out the “coordinates” (for lack of a better term) where the spawning class will instantiate walls, floors, and other objects that will make up the physical parts of the maze.</p><p>We can start implementing this plan by recognizing the need to break the maze up into “cells”. If we break it up into cells, we can have discrete positions from which we can determine if there is an empty space or a wall (just like we mentioned in the previous section).

To tell if there is a wall or an open space, we need 6 booleans; one to tell if the cell had been visited before, four to determine if there is a wall or not on each of its four sides, and a 6th boolean to determine if we should spawn a collectible at that point.

December 10, 2020 | https://blog.senx.io/digital-twins-requirement-for-industrial-ai/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.senx.io/digital-twins-requirement-for-industrial-ai/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Using AI to make industrial assets more efficient and reduce their downtime is on many agendas. Learn how digital twins and time series data play a major role in this plan.</p><article>
      
<p><strong>When interviewed, CEOs across industries all state that AI is part of their top priorities.</strong> But when it comes to actual implementation AI projects are not very glamorous. Past simple proofs of concept and the hiring of a team of data scientists, there is usually no sign of the highly anticipated digital transformation wished by the CEOs.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons for this disenchantment, far too many to list here. But among those, some are directly related to what we focus on at <a href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenX</a>, data, and the way industries introduce them in their environment.</p>



<h2>No digital transformation without data</h2>



<p>The willingness to transform is genuine in many organizations, driven by ambitious visions or just the consciousness that the competitive landscape is evolving.</p>



<p>The next step is usually for those businesses to pick some quick wins to prove that the transformation can be initiated and comfort everyone that it does not mean changing teams or radically modifying their way of working.</p>



<p>Those short projects aim at demonstrating the methodology for transforming limited operational perimeters. They often involve solving a problem with approaches to leveraging new technologies. Those technologies, 100% digital, need fuel to work, and that fuel is data. <strong>So the first step is to ensure data are available</strong>.</p>



<p>The firms hired to help in building those quick wins will then wander among departments. They will harvest datasets here and there until they have sufficient matter for implementing their solutions.</p>



<p>This step can sometimes take time if the data is not well identified and distributed across the organization. But it is a mandatory path to follow as without data no digital transformation will happen.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>No AI without big data</h2>



<p>Past the simple quick wins done to bootstrap the transformation comes a time when more ambitious projects are brought on the table, and that is when AI (Artificial Intelligence) comes into the conversation. The hype around AI is so strong that projects around AI and ML (Machine Learning) cannot be neglected.</p>



<p>The problem with the current hype is that very few people really understand what AI actually implies. <strong>For many</strong>,<strong> you buy an AI like you buy a Microsoft Office 365 subscription</strong>, this is just not true. The promise of AI is to bring new, automatic, ways to use data to help in or even completely assume the decision process. This promise can only be fulfilled if the actual AI put to work, otherwise called the model, is actually trained on the data in your very own organization, and this requires once again the same digital transformation fuel, data. The difference is that this time you need more of it. You are no longer trying to light a fondue burner but a rocket engine!</p>



<p>Training a model does indeed require a lot of data covering the various aspects of your business operations you want the model to focus on, also covering a long period of time so trend and seasonality can be modeled. </p>



<h4>This has several impacts</h4>



<ul><li>The first is that you cannot expect to train a model and efficiently introduce AI in your operations until you actually have collected enough meaningful data. And if your organization has not done so so far you need to start as soon as possible. </li><li>The second impact is that this data collection process is not a one time job. It does not stop once you have enough data for training a model. It needs to go on and on so you keep on accumulating signals on how your business operates to retrain your models in the future if their performance starts to degrade. This means that prior to your journey into the core of AI you need to plan for big data to be collected, stored and made available to teams across your organization so they can start looking at the data and imagine possible uses and models.</li></ul>



<h2>No industrial AI without Digital Twins</h2>



<p>Among verticals, industrial organizations face the hardest problems of data collection. Industries whose data mainly relates to users using their services are lucky. In the end, their data are not that massive. Sure we have all heard stories of banks or retailers hoarding piles of data. But we are talking about a few thousand interactions per year per user. So even with a billion users, which not that many banks or retailers have, we are talking a few trillion events per year.</p>



<p>In the industrial world, things are different, the assets producing data do not eat or sleep. They work day and night and sometimes produce thousands of measurements per second.</p>



<h3>For example...</h3>



<p>Take for example the CERN experiments at the LHC. They produced 600 million events per second during the campaigns for the quest of the Higgs boson. That is 51 trillion events per day. Luckily for the CERN, not all events needed to be retained. With highly efficient AI-based detectors, which needed to be trained with massive data themselves, they were able to limit the production to 100 000 events per second sent for digital reconstruction and ultimately 200 events persisted per second. </p>



<p>But other sectors need to retain more data. Synchro phasors (or PMUs, phase monitoring units) monitoring electrical grids, for example. They each produce several 1000s measures per second, and there are thousands of those at the scale of a country like France. This means millions of C37.118.2 messages sent every second, not to mention the IEC61850 messages sent to supervise the substations. </p>



<p>Same thing in aeronautics where aircraft typically produce 5 000 to 15 000 data points per second they are operating, or industrial assets whose PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) track the state of many sensors and actuators.</p>



<p>The use of AI in those verticals requires that those truly massive data be collected and organized. Since they are data related to physical assets, it is wise to use an approach which mimics these assets in a digital form, this approach is called Digital Twins. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>What are Digital Twins?</h3>



<p>The Digital Twin of an asset is the set of measures coming from its sensors and actuators. Those measures need to be tracked in time to catch the dynamics of the assets' operations. And the technology of choice to do so is a <a href="https://blog.senx.io/which-time-series-database-suited-to-your-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Series Database</a>. Indeed Digital Twins are nothing else than time series, some for the sensors, some for the actuators with their states. And if you want more advanced digital twins, some with the control commands sent to the assets to modify how it behaves.</p>



<p>Once you start collecting the data from your assets in a Time Series Database, you can easily access the state of those assets at any point in time. More importantly, you can start extracting features to train models to detect anomalies and perform predictive maintenance.</p>



<h2>Takeaways</h2>



<p>AI is on every business' agenda, but the importance of data is too often overlooked. <strong>When it comes to industrial AI, the first step towards a successful implementation is the collection of all sensor data to build Digital Twins of the physical assets involved.</strong> This approach needs to leverage a Time Series Database, the kind of database SenX offers with the <a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10 Time Series Platform</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>At the heart of web design are anchor and image tags. <em>How to work with and manipulate images and HTML links?</em> This question is trendy among front-end developers.</p>
<p>Anchor tags are very important to web design. They give meaning to the word, <strong>World Wide Web</strong>. They are the links that connect web pages in a spider-web like structure, allowing users to move seamlessly between pages of different sites and within pages of the same site.<br>Website images add to the beauty and the aesthetics of every web tool. Designers use them in headers, lists, profile pictures, descriptions, and galleries. A picture speaks a thousand words, and this is just as valid in <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/shopware-ecommerce">eCommerce</a></strong>. As online commerce booms, images have become key components in product promotion and when attracting more visitors.</p>
<h2>Anchor Tag (&lt;a&gt;)</h2>
<p>The anchor tag is written as &lt;a&gt; in HTML. HTML links are also called hyperlinks. The &lt;a&gt; tag is notably different from normal text. By default, it is underlined, has a blue color, and when the mouse is hovered over it, the cursor changes to a little hand. You can style anchor tags using CSS in different ways.<br>An essential attribute of the &lt;a&gt; tag is the <em>href</em>, which sets the link destination. The &lt;a&gt; tag, with the <em>href</em> attribute is the default standard for writing hyperlinks in HTML.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The basic syntax for writing a hyperlink in HTML is, </p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="https://www.codecoda.com/en"&gt;Visit Codecoda&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>From the syntax, the text in the href quote is the link's destination, while the text between the &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt; tags is the text the reader sees. A reader who wants to visit Codecoda for more information will see 'Visit Codecoda', but not the actual link to Codecoda. And when the user clicks Visit CodeCoda, they will end up on CodeCoda's homepage. Any other link can replace the link <a href="https://www.codecoda.com/en">https://www.codecoda.com/en</a> according to the desired destination.<br>You can place the &lt;a&gt; in the <strong>body </strong>and <strong>head </strong>section of a document. The head section defines the link to external resources like Google fonts, external CSS, and external Javascript.</p>
<h3>Types of Links</h3>
<h4>Absolute Links</h4>
<p>Absolute links are links that point to a specific path. They always begin with a protocol name. Absolute links are mainly used to define other sites within the internet. The link - <strong><a href="https://www.codecoda.com/en">https://www.codecoda.com/en</a></strong> is an absolute link. It refers to a specific website on the internet, and it starts with an HTTPS protocol.</p>
<h4>Relative Links</h4>
<p>Relative links are links referenced within a working directory/folder. The file path is usually relative to the current page. A relative file path is usually specified when linking to pages within a website. It doesn't need a protocol or address, just the filename.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="aboutus.html"&gt;About us&lt;/a&gt;  
&lt;!-- In this case, the aboutus.html file is located in the same folder as the working document.--&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The file path could also include folders that are outside the working directory.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="/Employees/employees.html"&gt;Employees&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Relative links remain the same - on the working machine and the webserver if uploaded. They should also be closely monitored. If a file path were to change, the URL would become void.</p>
<h4>In-Page Anchors</h4>
<p>Have you ever seen pages with a 'go to the top' link or button at the bottom? And when you click on it, it takes you all the way to the top of that page or document? Or a long web document is sectionalized with a 'table of contents' where each item is a link to different sections within the same page. This style of linking is called <strong>in-page anchors</strong> since they happen within the same web page.<br>To have this linking style within a web page, you must first set the location where the users will go. You can achieve this through the 'name' attribute. The defined name will be referenced by the <em>href</em> attribute with a pound sign. Here's a demo. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt; 
  &lt;body&gt; 
    &lt;h1&gt; Table of contents &lt;/h1&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#links"&gt;HTML Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#images"&gt;HTML Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

    &lt;h1&gt; MAIN CONTENT &lt;/h1&gt; 
 
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="links"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;HTML LINKS&lt;/h2&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Insert Long Text Here....... &lt;/p&gt; 
 
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name="links"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;HTML IMAGES&lt;/h2&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;Insert Long Text Here....... &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<h4>Characteristics of a link</h4>
<p>By default, all links are underlined.</p>
<ul>
<li>An unvisited link is blue.</li>
<li>A visited link is purple.</li>
<li>An active link is red.</li>
<li>Links are not just text. They could be images, buttons or other HTML elements.</li>
<li>During coding, you better leave dummy links empty or add the pound sign between quotes. This maneuver allows the element to be clickable, but the link goes nowhere.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=" "&gt;Dummy link&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href="#"&gt;Dummy link 2&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<h4>Link states (Pseudo Classes)</h4>
<p>Links are dynamic and occur in individual states. Link pseudo-classes allow developers to style the different states of a link in CSS. HTML links have five main active states - <em>link, active, hover, visited</em>, and <em>focus</em>. You can style all five of these at the same time for one link.<br>The <strong>:link</strong> state is the default state of a link, while <strong>:active</strong> denotes the currently selected link. The <strong>:hover</strong> state occurs when the mouse is over the link. The <strong>:visited</strong> state is a link that has been clicked. The <strong>:focus</strong> state occurs when a user focuses on a link.<br>You can attach different styles to these states. Here is a code that changes the text color as each state occurs.</p>
<pre><code>a:link{ 
  color: #000000; 
  text-decoration: none; 
} 
a:visited{ 
   color: #bbffcd; 
} 
a:hover { 
  color: #ffcc99; 
} 
a:active { 
  color: #f2f2f2; 
} 
a:focus { 
   color: #b1b1b1; 
} 
</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;html&gt; 
  &lt;a href="https://www.codecoda.com/blog/en"&gt;Visit our blog&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The pseudo-classes of the &lt;a&gt; tag follow an order. <strong>:link</strong> comes before <strong>:visited</strong> followed by <strong>:</strong><strong>hover</strong> and <strong>:active</strong>. If a pseudo-class is omitted, the succeeding pseudo-class follows immediately.<br>Like other HTML elements, &lt;a&gt; tags can have classes and ids attached to them.</p>
<h4>Common Types of Links</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default link</strong> - This is the default link style of either relative or absolute linking:
<pre><code>&lt;a href="contactus.html"&gt;Contact us&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Image links</strong> - This type of link makes an image clickable. The anchor tag wraps around the image tag.
<pre><code>&lt;a href="https://www.codecoda.com/blog/en"&gt; 
  &lt;img src="codaheaderimage.jpg" alt="header image" /&gt; 
&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Button Links</strong> - This link makes a button clickable. If the button tag is inside the &lt;a&gt; tag, then the entire button becomes clickable. If the &lt;a&gt;tag is inside the button tag, only the text inside it is clickable.
<pre><code>&lt;button&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;Click Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;!--only the text in the button is clickable --&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="https://www.google.com"&gt;&lt;button&gt;Click This&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;!-- entire button is clickable --&gt;</code></pre></li>
<li><strong>Navs</strong> - Here is how to use linking for navigations and menus. Usually, you can attach the anchor tag to a list and style it according to your preferences.
<pre><code>&lt;nav&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;Contact Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt; 
&lt;/nav&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code>/* CSS */ 
li { 
  display: inline-block; 
  padding: 2px; 
} 
ul { 
  list-style-type: none; 
  margin: 0; 
  padding: 0; 
} 
a { 
  font: 18px; 
  color: maroon; 
  text-decoration: none; 
} 
a:hover{ 
  color: red; 
  text-decoration:underline; 
}</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet will create an excellent, simple top bar navigation menu for a website.</p></li></ul>
<h2>IMAGES &lt;img&gt;</h2>
<p>We cannot overemphasize the importance of images on a website. As web development advances, the need for good, highly optimized, responsive images also increases.<br>The image tag is written as &lt;img&gt; in HTML. It takes two important attributes, src and alt. <strong>Src</strong> specifies the path to the image, while <strong>alt</strong> specifies an alternative text for the image. Something that briefly describes the image if, for any reason, the image does not load.<br>Other attributes of the image include <strong>srcset</strong>, <strong>width</strong>, <strong>height</strong>, and <strong>longdesc</strong>. Attributes like width and height can be written inline with &lt;img&gt; tag or specified later in the CSS.</p>
<h3>Background Images</h3>
<p>Background-image sets an image as the background for a specified element. Background images are quite popular in web design, and web designers usually use them in headers since they make it easy to have text written on them.<br>By default, a background-image repeats both vertically and horizontally. You can take care of this by using the <strong>no-repeat</strong> property.<br>In CSS, the background property is set using the URL value. The URL path could be relative or absolute. Background images could be adjusted, positioned, and manipulated using other background properties.<br>The following code snippet will create a background image with a text overlay positioned in the middle of the image.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="header-image"&gt; 
  &lt;div class="header-text"&gt; 
    &lt;h1&gt;TechBuddies&lt;/h1&gt; 
    &lt;h4&gt;We love tech&lt;/h4&gt; 
  &lt;/div&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code>.header-image{ 
  background-image:url("https://www.talkwalker.com/images/2020/blog-headers/image-analysis.png"); 
  background-color: #fbfcfb; 
  height: 500px; 
  background-position: center; 
  background-repeat: no-repeat; 
  background-size: cover; 
} 
.header-text { 
  text-align: center; 
  position: absolute; 
  top: 50%; 
  left: 50%; 
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%); 
  color: white; 
}</code></pre>
<h3>Responsive images</h3>
<p>A responsive image is one that adjusts automatically to fit the size of the screen display. It might seem like a headache trying to create different media queries for other screen sizes, but responsive images are relatively easy to define.</p>
<pre><code>img { 
  width: 100%; 
}</code></pre>
<p>Setting the width or max-width property to 100% automatically makes an image responsive, allowing it to fill up any element size.</p>
<h3>Centered Images</h3>
<p>Trying to handle alignment and responsiveness can be quite tricky. The default for centering an item uses text-align: center, but this doesn't always work, especially when other display properties counter it.<br>To horizontally center an image, you could also margin auto value.</p>
<pre><code>img { 
  margin: 0 auto;
}</code></pre>
<p>Flexbox provides a more robust way of centering images. To center an image horizontally, along the x-axis, use</p>
<pre><code>img {
  justify-content: center;
}</code></pre>
<p>To center an image …</p></div></div>

So we thought that with the ending of 2020 drawing closer, which we can all agree needs to get in the bin, a good idea would be to instead focus on the near future and the products that are really going to be making moves in 2021.</p><p>‍</p><p>There are always lists like these, but our unique AI-leveraged platform drills down into the raw data to find what products are exploding right now and what exactly will be a prominent feature in E-Commerce this coming year.&nbsp; The advantage of seeing Trends happening before they go mainstream in <em>‘realtime’</em> is that you can become a hyper-responsive e-commerce seller, marketer or drop seller - meeting consumer demands as they happen and adapting your focus to ensure optimal returns.</p><p>So, here’s a list of the trending products you want to be selling in 2021.

Created in a single and continuous knitting process, they give a more comfortable and often better-looking finish that doesn’t obstruct like the stitching in conventional clothing.</p><figure id="w-node-79c1862777c7-9294311d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fb3f0a1600a6e26c7943117/5fc55645abeb3982ba83dfa8_z7N252atSNK6QqtGuzGChUWH1wckICaGpqQa17gJG9VaYsjD5sctEnFxpoAbXl_w6iyuRJTCYNCzHJYc5PTPSLIFqDMj2JdBsyaEFmnpToosKnAWl9zYrSK7BTsnkjLdGO8GkkLQ.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong><em>Why?</em></strong><br></p><p>Seasonality will naturally play a significant role in the journey of this trend. While there is turbulence in the interest for seamless clothes, one advantage is that this graph shows the constant uptick - as a new form of stitching gains momentum. It is also suitable for both cold and warmer months, not to mention has the potential to have a positive environmental impact.</p><p><strong><em>Who?</em></strong><br></p><p>The most targeted segments are <strong>Fashionistas &amp; Beauty Lovers, Lifestyle Culture</strong> (Interest &amp; Lifestyle) and <strong>Beauty And Fashion </strong>(Category). Interest comes mainly from <strong>Millennials </strong>(23-37) (Demographics), <strong>Female </strong>(Gender Identity), that live in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong> (Place) and speak <strong>English </strong>(Language).</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Trending Product #2: Long Sleeve Crop Top</strong></h3><p><strong><em>What?</em></strong><br></p><p>Whilst a traditional crop top (also half shirt, midriff top or cutoff shirt) is a top that exposes the waist, navel, or abdomen; the<a href="https://trendlab.io/search/?q=long%20sleeve%20crop%20top&amp;geo=WW&amp;originalTerm=long%20sleeve%20crop%20top"> long sleeve crop </a>top subverts the form and...adds arm covering! Surprisingly.&nbsp;</p><p>A relatively recent phenomenon, the long sleeve crop top has been boosted by the growth of the athleisure market and the merging of sportswear with everyday casual wear. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fb3f0a1600a6e26c7943117/5fc556450b08f68069ecd540_VVklu2-2az7YbuTzb3U7qkEkf_5TTMFuJCjYBWHM6CsNCircvJj5ND_JhPaTA5yBestsKoWnLcO5aaoV8hW-M2N1jN4sVM7hscjjzUInhhqQFkbxYCstZ1tLnArZCwRDh76S14f3.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong><em>Why?</em></strong><br></p><p>Whilst this trend has been relatively stable overall (7.2%) in the last year, we foresee a continuous climb despite the noted seasonal impact. This means that if you take out the seasonal trends - which will ultimately play a big part in fashion forecasts, it still maintains a steady increase in interest online. Retailers like <a href="https://www.boohoo.com/womens/tops/crop-tops">boohoo.com</a>, an online retail site aimed at 16-30-year-olds drive a significant amount of the sentiment with the birth of what has been called <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/a33521644/fashion-lockdown-dressing-up-joy/">'lockdown fashion’.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em><br></em><strong><em>Who?</em></strong><br></p><p>The most targeted segment are <strong>Fashionistas &amp; Beauty Lovers,</strong> <strong>Lifestyle Culture</strong> (Interest &amp; Lifestyle) and <strong>Social Media</strong> (Category).

You’d be wrong. It continues to Mildly Rise overall (11.3%), but the exciting trend is when you take out Seasonality impact. The Athleisure revolution is now in maturity - where it’s a way of life, rather than just a fashion trend. Plus it’s only just starting to arrive in <a href="https://hypebae.com/2020/11/doverist-activewear-athleisure-hong-kong-brand-fall-winter-collection-lookbook-usa-release">Asia</a><strong> </strong>- so it can only get bigger.<em>‍</em></p><p>‍</p><p><strong><em>Who?</em></strong><br></p><p>The most targeted segment are <strong>Healthy Lifestyle, Fashionistas &amp; Beauty Lovers </strong>(Interest &amp; Lifestyle) and <strong>Beauty And Fashion</strong> (Category). Interest comes mainly from <strong>Millenials </strong>(23-37) (Demographics), <strong>Female </strong>(Gender Identity), that live in <strong>Singapore </strong>(Place) and speak <strong>English </strong>(Language).</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>Trending Product #4: Boyfriend hoodie</strong></h3><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fb3f0a1600a6e26c7943117/5fc556459a3c21b4bf2621fa_tnL7lzXX5dcSvgfS2mOISrhSyTTEaZRFNCg8xKfXFiNtvP5qjc9QC93Ari7SxV42UzPMrsLaanZZs_wPl09aBjPvHTt0kOSCkeNUTi4yMOtF7adDNZKRPCLZiGkRix_5PJ6udZ6x.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong><em>What?</em></strong><br></p><p>In fashion design, at least, ‘boyfriend’ is any style of women's clothing that was modified from a corresponding men's garment. The <a href="https://trendlab.io/search/?q=boyfriend%20hoodie&amp;geo=WW&amp;originalTerm=boyfriend%20hoodie">Boyfriend hoodie </a>is probably the most commonly recognised part of this. That’s because, despite its slightly outdated and gendered term, it’s recognised culturally as the ‘borrowed’ item of clothing number one, for some extra insulation.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-5e286c9e0e35-9294311d"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fb3f0a1600a6e26c7943117/5fc55645a27a92d4fda74a84_rZo2Loeb3QCHNfmX_Sfppcr5AnU6iBLRmz152T8-QxOt82uDEAAZzQwfRZggU9WzQyA7jhpi-SoBpSRNw7TBcXYD3ais7Lu2RIZ816OVNiULF-bsB1D8-1molCDJska-Mk-YT7L9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong><em>Why?</em></strong><br>We’ve seen a considerable surge in working from home - this changes the way people dress.

The increase in healthy lifestyles have led to a surge in health-focused kitchen equipment and the air fryer is one of the market’s strongest examples (...because who doesn’t like chips?).

Beauty is King (or Queen) in the E-Commerce industry, where an abundance of products flourish to a keen audience of shoppers. The aesthetic nature of the sector means online viewing, particularly on the stuff you use (rather than the things you wear!) will always be the first thing an aspiring E-Commerce pro’s shopping list - we foresee another bounce in late 2021.</p><p><strong><em>Who?</em></strong><br></p><p>The most targeted segments are <strong>Fashionistas &amp; Beauty Lovers, Lifestyle Culture</strong> (Interest &amp; Lifestyle) and <strong>Beauty And Fashion</strong> (Category).

So we used to see clear differentiation, but now - rugs/carpets/room present a cluster.

  <p><span>09 Dec 2020</span></p><p>Yesterday, Mapbox announced that they were moving their <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js">Mapbox GL JS</a> library from a standard BSD license to a new very much <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/blob/main/LICENSE.txt">non-open source license</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://joemorrison.medium.com/death-of-an-open-source-business-model-62bc227a7e9b">Joe Morrison said</a> the news “shook” him (and also the readers of the Hacker News front page, well done Joe). It did me as well. Although apparently for completely different reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mapbox is the protagonist of a story I’ve told myself and others countless times. It’s a seductive tale about the incredible, counterintuitive concept of the “open core” business model for software companies.
<br>– Joe Morrison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a couple things wrong with Joe’s encomium to Mapbox and “open core”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first, Mapbox was <strong>never</strong> an open core business;</li>
  <li>second, open core is a <strong>pretty ugly model</strong> that has very little to do with the open source ethos of shared intellectual pursuit.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/core.jpg" alt="Open Core"></p>

<h2 id="mapbox-was-never-open-core">Mapbox was never Open Core</h2>

<p>From the very start (well, at least from the early middle), Mapbox was built to be a location-based services business. It was to be the Google Maps for people who were unwilling to accept the downsides of Google Maps.</p>

<p>Google Maps will track you. They will take your data exhaust and ruthlessly monetize it. They will take your data and use it to build a better Google Maps that they will then re-sell to others.</p>

<p>If you value your data at all (if you are, say, a major auto maker), you probably don’t want to use Google Maps, because they are going to steal your data while providing you services. Also, Google Maps is increasingly the “only game in town” for location based services, and it seems reasonable to expect price increases (<a href="https://housesigma.com/blog-en/2018/06/07/google-map-price-hike/">it has already happened once</a>).</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/google-location-history.png" alt="Google is Tracking You"></p>

<p>Nobody can compete with Google Maps, can they? Why yes, they can! Mapbox fuses the collaborative goodness of the <a href="https://openstreemap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> community with clever software that enables the kinds of services that Google sells 
(<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/maps/#raster-tiles">map tiles</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/#search">geocoding</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/#navigation">routing</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/access-elevation-data/">elevation services</a>), and a bunch of services Google doesn’t sell (like <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">custom map authoring</a>) or won’t sell (like <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/vision/">automotive vision</a>).</p>

<p>But like Google, the value proposition Mapbox sells isn’t in the software, so much as the data and the platform underneath. Mapbox has built a unique, scalable platform for handling the huge problem of turning raw OSM data into usable services, and raw location streams into usable services. They sell access to that platform.</p>

<p>Mapbox has never been a software company, they’ve always been a data and services company.</p>

<p>The last company I worked for, <a href="https://carto.com/">CARTO</a>, had a similar model, only moreso. All the parts of their value proposition (PostgreSQL, PostGIS, the CARTO UI, the tile server, the upload, everything) are <a href="https://github.com/cartodb">open source</a>. But they want you to pay them when you load your data into their service and use their software there. How can that be? Well, do you want to assemble all those open source parts into a working system and keep it running? Of course not. You just want to publish a map, or run an analysis, or add a spatial analysis to an existing system. So you pay them money.</p>

<p>Is Mapbox an “open core” company? No, is there a “Mapbox Community Edition” everyone can have, but an “Enterprise Edition” that is only available under a proprietary license? No. Does Mapbox even sell <strong>any software at all</strong>? No. (Yes, some.) They (mostly) sell services.</p>

<p>So what’s with the re-licensing? I’ll come back to that, but first…</p>

<h2 id="open-core-is-a-shitty-model">Open Core is a Shitty Model</h2>

<p>Actually, no, it seems to be a passable <strong>monetization</strong> model, for some businesses. It’s a shitty open source model though.</p>

<ul>
  <li>MongoDB has an open source core, and sells a bunch of proprietary enterprise add-ons. They’ve grown very fast and might even reach sufficient velocity to escape their huge VC valuation (or they may yet be sucked into the singularity).</li>
  <li>Cloudera before them reached huge valuations selling proprietary add-ons around the open Hadoop ecosystem.</li>
  <li>MySQL flirted with an open core model for many years, but mostly stuck to spreading FUD about the GPL in order to get customers to pay them for proprietary licenses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Easily the strangest part of the MySQL model was trash-talking the very open source license <strong>they chose</strong> to place their open source software under.</p>

<p>All those companies have been quite succesful along the axes of “getting users” and “making money”. Let me tell you why open core is nonetheless a shitty model:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell me about the MongoDB developer community. Where do they work? Oh right, Mongo.</li>
  <li>Tell me about the Cloudary developer community? Where do they work?</li>
  <li>Tell me about the MySQL developer community? Where to they work? Oh right, <strong>Oracle</strong>. (There’s a whole other blog post to be written about why sole corporate control of open source projects is a <strong>bad idea</strong>.)</li>
</ul>

<p>A good open source model is one that promotes heterogeneity of contributors, a sharing of control, and a rising of all boats when the software succeeds. Open core is all about centralizing gain and control to the sponsoring organization.</p>

<p>This is going to sound precious, but the leaders of open core companies don’t “care” about the ethos of open source. The CEOs of open core companies view open source (correctly, from their point of view) as a “sales channel”. It’s a way for customers to discover their paid offerings, it’s not an end in itself.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/funnel.png" width="75%" alt="Sales Funnel"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We didn’t open source it to get help from the community, to make the product better. We open sourced as a freemium strategy; to drive adoption. 
<br>– Dev Ittycheria, CEO, MongoDB</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yeah, open core is a way to make money but it doesn’t “do” anything for open source as a shared proposition for building useful tools anyone can use, for anything they find useful, anytime and anywhere they like.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q5o-4pnxDQ">Adam Jacob’s take</a> on the current contradictions in the world of open source ethics; there are no hard and fast answers.</p>

<h2 id="mapbox-shook-me-too">Mapbox Shook Me Too</h2>

<p>I too was a little shook to learn of the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25347310">Mapbox GL JS relicensing</a>, but perhaps not “surprised”. This had happened before, with <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14734589">Tilemill</a> (open) morphing into <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/">Mapbox Studio</a> (closed).</p>

<p>The change says nothing about “open source” in the large as a model, and everything about “single vendor projects” and whether you should, strategically, believe their licensing.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/images//2020/empty-promise.jpg" alt="Empty Promises"></p>

<p>I (and others) took the licensing (incorrectly) of Mapbox GL JS to be a promise, not only for now but the future, and made decisions based on that (incorrect) interpretation. I integrated GL JS into <a href="https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_tileserv/blob/master/assets/preview-table.html">an open source project</a> and now I have to revisit that decision.</p>

<p>The license change also says something about the business realities Mapbox is facing going forward. The business of selling location based services is a competitive one, and one that is perhaps not panning out as well as their venture capital valuation (<a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/softbank-mapbox-series-c-be207b866b27">billions?</a>) would promise.</p>

<p>No doubt the board meetings are fraught. Managers are casting about for future sources of revenue, for places where more potential customers can be <strong>squeeeeezed</strong> into the sales funnel.</p>

<p>I had high hopes for Mapbox as a counterweight to Google Maps, a behemoth that seems <a href="https://www.justinobeirne.com/google-maps-moat">likely to consume us all</a>. The signs that the financial vice is beginning to close on it, that the promise might not be fulfilled, they shake me.</p>

<p>So, yeah, Joe, this is big news. Shaking news. But it has nothing to do with “open source as a business model”.</p>

Its long-term objective is:</p><ul><li>In India, to reinforce pro-Indian and anti-Pakistan (and anti-Chinese) feelings.</li><li>Internationally, to consolidate the power and improve the perception of India, to damage the reputation of other countries and ultimately benefit from more support from international institutions such as the EU and the UN.</li></ul><p>To do so, the operation consists of:</p><ul><li>The support to minority and human rights NGOs and think-tanks.</li><li>The use of Members of the European Parliament to create a mirage of institutional support from European institutions to these minority groups, in favour of Indian interests and against Pakistan (and China).</li><li>An active presence in Geneva and the United Nations’ Human Rights Council through:<ul><li>side-events and demonstrations in support of minority rights;</li></ul><ul><li>impersonation of extinguished UN-accredited NGOs or use speaking slots reserved to various NGOs whose original missions seem totally unrelated.</li></ul></li><li>The creation of fake media in Brussels, Geneva and across the world and/or the repackaging and dissemination via ANI and obscure local media networks – at least in 97 countries – to multiply the repetition of online negative content about countries in conflict with India, in particular Pakistan.</li></ul><h3><strong>Indian Chronicles: Case reopened</strong></h3><p>During our previous investigation, we decided to leave some of the websites, domain names and associated email addresses that deserved a closer look for later. Over the last months, we took a deeper dive, with a specific focus on the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace (CSOP).</p><p>We soon realised that this US-based NGO – accredited to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) – had become inactive in the late 1970s before being resurrected in 2005. Its identity had been hijacked by the same actors depicted in our first investigation. Shockingly, we discovered that the organisation had not only been revived. Its former Chairman and “grandfather of international law in the US”, Louis B. Sohn, who passed away in 2006, seemingly attended a UN Human Rights Council meeting in 2007 and participated in an event organised by “Friends of Gilgit-Baltistan” in Washington D.C. in 2011.</p><h3><strong>Advocacy in Geneva: outside and inside the United Nations Human Rights Council</strong></h3><p>From then on, we uncovered an entire network of coordinated UN-accredited NGOs promoting Indian interests and criticizing Pakistan repeatedly. We could tie at least 10 of them directly to the Srivastava family, with several other dubious NGOs pushing the same messages.</p><p>These UN-accredited NGOs work in coordination with non-accredited think-tanks and minority-rights NGOs in Brussels and Geneva. Several of them – like the European Organization for Pakistani Minorities (EOPM), Baluchistan House and the South Asia Democratic Forum (SADF) – were directly but opaquely created by the Srivastava group. In Geneva, these think-tanks and NGOs are in charge of lobbying, organising demonstrations and speaking during press conferences and UN side-events. They were repeatedly given the floor at the UN on behalf of the accredited organisations.</p><figure><img width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Geneva.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20675'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Geneva.png"></figure><h3><strong>Resurrection of UN-accredited NGOs and the hijacking of causes</strong></h3><p>Our investigation led to the finding of 10 UN-accredited NGOs directly controlled by the Srivastava Group, which our full report introduces at length. Their common trait? The fact that they all rose from the ashes of real NGOs. Indian Chronicles effectively benefited from the track record of these organisations while pursuing their own agenda: discrediting Pakistan and promoting Indian interests at UN conferences and hearings.</p><p>As we looked into the history of these NGOs, it quickly became clear that the topics and issues at their very heart are not much of a concern for Indian Chronicles. The operation takes just about any defunct NGO it can find and revives it to promote Indian interests. Examples include organisations defending peace, protecting the environment or even… promoting canned food.</p><p>Before it ceased to exist in 2007, the Canners International Permanent Committee (CIPC) was all about the canning industry. Its reincarnation does not seem so concerned with food anymore: It mostly dispatches Geneva-based students to the UN to talk about Pakistan, and even organised side events on human rights at the UN.</p><figure><img width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NGO_UN.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20675'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NGO_UN.png"></figure><h3><strong>Lobbying in Brussels: Using Members of the European Parliament through an online EU affairs honeypot</strong></h3><p>The organisations created by the Srivastava Group in Brussels organised trips for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to Kashmir, Bangladesh and the Maldives. Some of these trips led to much institutional controversy, as the delegations of MEPs were often presented as official EU delegations when they were in fact not travelling on behalf of the Parliament.</p><p>The actors orchestrating Indian Chronicles are directly tied – and again not at all transparently – to the creation of three informal groups in the European Parliament, namely the “South Asia Peace Forum”, the “Baloch Forum” and “Friends of Gilgit-Baltistan”. They have organised press conferences and events within and in front of the European Parliament.</p><p>Organisations like WESTT – the Women Economic and Social Think-Tank – have drafted and suggested parliamentary questions to the European Commission, along with articles for fake EU magazines such as EP Today. These served as a honeypot to attract a growing number of MEPs into a pro-India and anti-Pakistan discourse, often using causes such as minorities rights and women’s rights as an entry point.</p><p>This is how we uncovered EU Chronicle – the new “EP Today”. A new fake media with fake journalists supposedly covering European affairs, yet essentially providing a platform for MEPs to sign pro-Indian articles. In less than 6 months of existence, already 11 MEPs have written or endorsed op-eds at a remarkably high pace for EU Chronicle.</p><figure><img width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EuChronicle.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20675'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EuChronicle.png"></figure><h3><strong>The role of ANI: Repackaging and amplifying the content produced in Brussels &amp; Geneva</strong></h3><p>Back to EU Chronicle. The only valuable coverage these op-eds receive, comes from an immediate repackaging by an Indian press agency named ANI (Asian News International), often quoting these op-eds as genuine articles from “independent media EU Chronicle”. Without Times of Geneva and 4 News Agency which stopped their activities following our previous investigation, ANI – which is considered as one of the biggest news agencies in India and the largest television agency of India – remains the only press agency to extensively cover the activities of dubious NGOs in Geneva.</p><p>The coverage – and often distortion – by ANI of the content produced in Brussels and Geneva led us to the Big News Network and the World News Network – an entire network of 500+ fake local media in 95 countries that have helped reproduce negative iterations about Pakistan (or China). We also realised that the content produced was primarily targeted at Indian nationals, with an extensive coverage of these barely known “media”, MEPs and “NGOs” in Europe.</p><p>Essentially, our investigation details how the activities of a fake zombie-NGO and that of a fake specialised media can be repackaged, distorted and amplified by malicious actors to influence or disinform globally, using loopholes in international institutions and online search engines.</p><figure><img width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Distrotion.png" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20675'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://www.disinfo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Distrotion.png"></figure><h2><strong>Indian Chronicles and EP Today: the same modus operandi</strong></h2><p>As in our first investigation, we could observe these patterns:</p><ul><li>Extensive use of student interns, here speaking at the United Nations on behalf of one or more of these NGOs;</li><li>Resurrection of shuttered organisations (NGOs, media) and deceased persons (Louis B. Sohn);</li><li>Use of Regus virtual office addresses or simply fake addresses whenever an address was needed;</li><li>Misleading representation of the views of individual MEPs as general support or official position from the European Union;</li><li>Maximisation of negative content about Pakistan online, primarily using a network of fake local media across the world.</li></ul><p>The actors behind EP Today and EU Chronicle registered 550+ domain names of NGOs, think-tanks, media, European Parliament informal groups, religious and Imam organizations, obscure publishing companies and public personalities. A non-negligeable proportion of domain names were bought in the context of the cyberwarfare with Pakistan, to cybersquat on domains that Pakistan might later wish to use.</p><p>Every researcher working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In a data-driven organization, there is a constant need to provide vast amounts of data to the teams. There are many tools available to aid your requirements and needs. Choosing the right tool can be a little challenging and overwhelming at times. The basic principle you can keep in mind is that there is no right tool or architecture, it depends on what you need. </p><p>In this guide, I’m going to show you how to build a simple event-driven data pipeline in AWS. Pipelines are often scheduled or interval based, however, the event-driven concept is unique and a good starting point. Instead of trying to figure out the right intervals of the pipeline activation, you can use an event handler to deal with certain events to activate your pipeline. </p><p>To learn more about which problem we were solving in Traindex and why the data pipeline was the right choice for us, refer to my previous article <a href="https://www.traindex.io/blog/introduction-to-data-pipelines-26o7">Introduction to Data Pipelines</a>. </p><p>As an example, we would be using the “Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets” which is available on Kaggle. Our goal would be to set up a data preprocessing pipeline. Once you have uploaded the CSV file in a specified bucket, an event is generated. A lambda function would handle that event and will activate your pipeline. Your data pipeline would be AWS Data Pipeline which is a web service that helps you process and move data between different AWS compute and storage services. This pipeline would divide a compute resource and run your preprocessing code in that resource. Once your data is cleaned and preprocessed, it will upload it to the specified bucket for later use. Based on these objectives, we can divide our task into the following sub-tasks:</p><ul><li>Creating a pre-configured AMI</li><li>Defining AWS data pipeline architecture</li><li>Writing the event handler AWS Lambda function</li><li>Integrating everything</li></ul><p>Before diving into the steps, make sure you have the following preconditions met</p><ul><li>You require an AWS account with certain IAM privileges</li><li>Make sure you have already downloaded the data from “Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets”</li><li>Active internet connection</li></ul><p>This step can be optional based on your requirements but it is good to have a pre-configured AMI that you can use in the compute resources. Follow the following steps to create a pre-configured AMI: </p><ul><li>Go to the AWS console, click on the Services dropdown menu, and select EC2</li><li>On the EC2 dashboard, select Launch an Instance</li><li>Select the Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-01fee56b22f308154 </li><li>Select the General Purpose t2.micro which is free-tier eligible</li><li>Click on Review and Launch and then click Launch to launch this EC2 instance</li><li>Now go to the EC2 dashboard and select your EC2 Instance. Copy the public DNS and SSH into your created instance. </li><li>Now, install all the required packages, tools, and libraries in it using standard Linux commands.</li><li>Also, set up any credentials you might require later like AWS credentials, etc.</li><li>Once satisfied with your instance, it’s time to create an AMI image from this instance.</li><li>Go to EC2 dashboard, right-click on your instance. Click on Actions, select Image, and click on create an image.</li><li>Keep the default settings and create the image by clicking on Create Image.</li><li>It’ll take a couple of minutes and once it’s done, go ahead and terminate the instance you created. You will only need the AMI ID in the next phases.</li></ul><p>The main idea behind this step is to set up a data pipeline which upon certain triggers, launches an EC2 instance. And then we will have a bash script run in that instance that would be responsible to move our raw data back and forth and run our preprocessing python script. This step can be further divided into 3 main subsections, let’s do it.</p><h2>AWS Data Pipeline Architecture Definition</h2><p>First of all, let’s define the AWS data pipeline architecture. We can do so by writing a JSON file that defines and describes our data pipeline and provides it with all the required logic. I’ll try to break it down as much as required but you can always refer to the documentation to explore more options. The data pipeline definition can have different pieces of information like</p><ul><li>Names, locations, and formats of your data sources</li><li>Activities that transform the data</li><li>The schedule for those activities</li><li>Resources that run your activities and preconditions</li><li>Preconditions that must be satisfied before the activities can be scheduled</li><li>Ways to alert you with status updates as pipeline execution proceeds</li></ul><p>We can express the data pipeline definition in three parts: Objects, parameters and values.</p><h3>Objects</h3><p>Below you can see the syntax of the definition.</p><pre><code>{
  "objects" : [
    {
       "name1" : "value1",
       "name2" : "value2"
    },
    {
       "name1" : "value3",
       "name3" : "value4",
       "name4" : "value5"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre><p>Following the above syntax we can place our required objects one by one. First of all, we need to define our pipeline object. We would be defining fields like ID, name, IAM and resource roles, path to save pipeline logs and schedule type. You can add or remove these fields based on your requirements and should look at the official documentation to know more about these and other fields. </p><pre><code>{
        "id": "Default",
        "name": "Default",
        "failureAndRerunMode": "CASCADE",
        "resourceRole": "DataPipelineDefaultResourceRole",
        "role": "DataPipelineDefaultRole",
        "pipelineLogUri": "s3://automated-data-pipeline/logs/",
        "scheduleType": "ONDEMAND
    },</code></pre><p>You can use this object with one change, that is the <code>pipelineLogUri</code> field. You can give the path to the S3 bucket you want to save your logs in. The next object in our definition is the compute i.e. EC2 resource.</p><pre><code>{
        "id": "MyEC2Resource",
        "type": "Ec2Resource",
        "imageId": "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "instanceType": "r5.large",
        "spotBidPrice": "2.0",
        "terminateAfter": "30 Minutes",
        "actionOnTaskFailure" : "terminate",
        "maximumRetries" : "1",
        "role": "DataPipelineDefaultRole",
        "resourceRole": "DataPipelineDefaultResourceRole",
        "keyPair" : "&lt;YOUR-KEY&gt;"
      },</code></pre><p>We have described our compute needs in this object, for example, we need an EC2 instance of type r5.large on spot pricing with your key. Also, remember to put in the pre-configured AMI ID in the <code>imageId</code> field so it launches the instance with all of the configurations set in place. Now, let’s move on to the next and last object which is the shell activity. This object would be able to run our shell script which in turn would run our preprocessing code. </p><pre><code>{
        "id": "ShellCommandActivityObj",
        "name": "ShellCommandActivityObj",
        "type": "ShellCommandActivity",
        "command": "aws s3 cp s3://automated-data-pipeline/script.sh ~/ &amp;&amp; sudo sh ~/script.sh #{myS3DataPath}",
        "maximumRetries": "0",
        "runsOn": {
            "ref": "MyEC2Resource"
        }
      }</code></pre><p>In this object, the two most important fields are <code>command</code> and <code>runsOn</code>. In the <code>command</code> field you would define the bash command that you would like to run on the EC2 instance described earlier. I described a command that will copy a bash script into the EC2 instance and run it. Note that I’m also giving it a parameter <code>#{myS3DataPath}</code>, it is the path we would like our pipeline to preprocess. It is given as a parameter to add flexibility to our pipeline so it can handle different data sets. The <code>runsOn</code> field takes the ID of the EC2 resource we created earlier so it can run the shell command on that resource.  </p><h3>Parameters</h3><p>Parameters place holders should be written in this format <code>#{myPlaceholder}</code>. Every parameter should start with the "my" suffix. Here is the parameter section of the definition JSON file</p><pre><code>"parameters": [
        {
            "id": "myS3DataPath",
            "name": "mys3DataPath",
            "description": "This is the path to the data uploaded",
            "type": "AWS::S3::ObjectKey"

        }
    ]</code></pre><p>We have defined that our parameter should be AWS S3 object key type. The whole data pipeline definition can be found <a href="https://github.com/EshbanTheLearner/preprocessing-pipeline-demo/blob/main/definition.json">here</a>. </p><p>Now, after you are done with defining your pipeline, activate it by the following command.</p><pre><code>aws datapipeline create-pipeline --name data-preprocessing-pipeline --unique-id data-preprocessing-pipeline</code></pre><p>Once created, you can put the definition in place. Note that we can pass a temporary parameter value at this stage, which later can be passed dynamically. </p><pre><code>aws datapipeline put-definition --pipeline-definition file://definition.json \ --parameter-values s3DataPath=&lt;s3://your/s3/data/path&gt; --pipeline-id &lt;Your Pipeline ID&gt;</code></pre><p>Since our data pipeline is defined and created, let’s write the bash script that will run in the compute resource of our data pipeline.</p><h2>Bash Script</h2><p>This script will run on the EC2 instance that the pipeline would launch as its compute resource. The working of this script is simple, it makes a new working directory, sets the current working directory and path to data in S3 bucket as environment variables, copies the data into the current working directory, runs the python script and finally uploads the cleaned data back to S3. Here is the code you will need:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo -e "Starting the process"

sudo mkdir ~/data-pipeline-tmp
sudo chmod ugo+rwx ~/data-pipeline-tmp
cd ~/data-pipeline-tmp

CURRENT_DIR=$(eval "pwd")

DATA_PATH=$1

export WORKING_DIR=$CURRENT_DIR
export S3_DATA_PATH=$DATA_PATH

aws s3 cp s3://automated-data-pipeline/scripts/script.py $WORKING_DIR

python3 $WORKING_DIR/script.py

aws s3 cp $WORKING_DIR/twitter_data_cleaned.csv s3://automated-data-pipeline/outputs/</code></pre><p>In my case, the S3 bucket is named <code>automated-data-pipeline</code> and I have made folders to separate different objects. This code can also be found <a href="https://github.com/EshbanTheLearner/preprocessing-pipeline-demo/blob/main/script.sh">here</a>. Next is the python code that will preprocess the data.</p><h2>Python Code</h2><p>This code is the standard preprocessing code that we will use to clean our datasets. Here’s the code that you would need. Changes can be made, add or remove anything according to your needs:</p><pre><code>import pandas as pd
import re
import nltk</code></pre></div></div></div>

<li>The last part</li>
<li>The limit of generators: Infinity and Beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>In Python, generators form part of the intermediate topics. Since it differs from conventional functions, beginners have to take sometimes to wrap their head around it. This article presents materials that will be useful both for beginners and advanced programmers. It attempts to give enough to understand generators in depth but don’t cover all use cases.</p>
<h3>Why were Python generators introduced?</h3>
<p>Before we present generators and it’s syntax, it’s important to know why in the first place were generators introduced. The yield keyword does not mean generators. One has to understand the concept behind. The original PEP introduced “the concept of generators to Python, as well as a new statement used in conjunction with them, the yield statement” [1].</p>
<p>The general use case of generators is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When a producer function has a hard enough job that it requires maintaining state between values produced, [1]
</p></blockquote>
<p>And more explicitly</p>
<blockquote><p>
  provide a kind of function that can return an intermediate result (“the next value”) to its caller, but maintaining the function’s local state so that the function can be resumed again right where it left off. [1]
</p></blockquote>
<p>So we understand that a new kind of functions was needed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>

<h3>How do Python Generators differ from normal functions?</h3>
<p>Compared to normal functions, once you return from a function, you can go back to return more values. A normal function in contrast, once you return from it, there is no going back.</p>
<p>Normal function:</p>
<pre><code>def x():
    print('abc')
    return 
    print('def') # not reached
x()
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, <code>def</code> will not be printed as the function exited before. Let’s examine a basic generator example:</p>
<pre><code>def x():
  a = 0
  while 1:
    yield a

    a += 1

z = x()

print(z)
print(next(z))
print(next(z))
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;generator object x at 0x01ACB760&gt;
0
1
</code></pre>
<p>From the example above, once we called next, it returned a value. <strong>The purpose of next is to go to the next yield statement</strong>. When we called next the first time, it went to the next yield since the beginning which is when <code>a</code> was initially at 0.</p>
<p>The second call of next started executing <code>a += 1</code> and went to the beginning of the loop where it encountered a yield statement and returned <code>a</code> with the updated value.</p>
<p>By <code>a</code> being updated we see that even when the function was exited the first time, when the program went back into it, it continued on the previous state when <code>a</code> was 0. This accomplishes the two aims of being able to resume functions and saving the previous state.</p>
<p>To understand it better, here are some more names that were proposed instead of yield [1] but were eventually rejected:</p>
<ul>
<li>return 3 and continue</li>
<li>return and continue 3</li>
<li>return generating 3</li>
<li>continue return 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Guido gives a summary of generators [1]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In practice (how you think about them), generators are functions, but with the twist that they’re resumable.
</p></blockquote>
<h3>Execution flow</h3>
<p>The following snippet gives us an idea about the execution:</p>
<pre><code>def x():
  print('started')
  while 1:
    print('before yield')
    yield
    print('after yield')


z = x()

next(z)
print('-- 2nd call')
next(z)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>started
before yield
-- 2nd call
after yield
before yield
</code></pre>
<p>From it we confirm that the first call to next executes everything in the function until the first yield statement. We did not return any values but used yield purely to control the flow of execution in the same sense of return.</p>
<p>Yield needs not to be in infinite loops, you can use several at once in the same function body:</p>
<pre><code>def x():
  print('start')
  yield 
  print('after 1st yield')
  yield
  print('after 2nd yield')

z = x()
next(z)
next(z)
next(z)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>start
after 1st yield
after 2nd yield
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "lab.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    next(z)
StopIteration
</code></pre>
<p>In case you called next more than there is yield statements, generator functions raise the <code>StopIteration</code>. In case you want to auto-handle <code>StopIteration</code> until there are no more left, use … a for loop:</p>
<pre><code>def x():
  print('start')
  yield 
  print('after 1st yield')
  yield
  print('after 2nd yield')

z = x()
for _ in z:
  pass

</code></pre>
<p>In case you return a value, the loop variable will be equal to that value:</p>
<pre><code>def x():
  print('start')
  yield 1
  print('after 1st yield')
  yield 2
  print('after 2nd yield')

z = x()
for _ in z:
  print(_)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>start
1
after 1st yield
2
after 2nd yield
</code></pre>
<h3>Immediate usefulness</h3>
<p>Since we saw that we can use yield with an infinite loop, this is extremely powerful. We can break infinity in steps. Consider this:</p>
<pre><code>def odd_till(number):
  n = 1
  while n &lt; number:
    yield n
    n += 2

for odd_num in odd_till(10):
  print(odd_num)
</code></pre>
<p>We yield one number and the function exits, the for loop calls it again. It yields one number and exits. And so on. It goes about it in micro steps. The operations completed in one cycle is is just an increment <code>n += 2</code> and a check <code>n &lt; number</code>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote><p>
  <code>odd_till(10)</code> or <code>odd_till(10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)</code> don’t not cause memory errors
</p></blockquote>
<h3>next and for loops</h3>
<p>Two things might puzzle you:</p>
<ul>
<li>why was next used?</li>
<li>how can a function with 2 yields work when a for loop is used with it?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer lies in in the fact that generators implement the iterator protocols, the same one used by lists. Here is a class customised to act as a generator [7]:</p>
<pre><code># Using the generator pattern (an iterable)
class firstn(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.num = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    # Python 3 compatibility
    def __next__(self):
        return self.next()

    def next(self):
        if self.num &lt; self.n:
            cur, self.num = self.num, self.num+1
            return cur
        else:
            raise StopIteration()

sum_of_first_n = sum(firstn(1000000))
</code></pre>
<h3>Generators introduced for memory saving</h3>
<p>Consider a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>sum([x*x for x in range(10)])
</code></pre>
<p>A generator expression is much, much more efficicent [2]:</p>
<pre><code>sum(x*x for x in range(10))
</code></pre>
<p>This was the second addition in the generator story.</p>
<h3>Generators for tasks</h3>
<p>Lets modify our two functions with print</p>
<pre><code>def odd_till(number):
  n = 1
  while n &lt; number:
    print('odd_till {} currently: {}'.format(number, n))
    yield n
    n += 2

def even_till(number):
  n = 0
  while n &lt; number:
    print('even_till {} currently: {}'.format(number, n))
    yield n
    n += 2
</code></pre>
<p>Lets have a class to run functions</p>
<pre><code>from collections import deque

class RunFunc:
  def __init__(self):
    self._queue = deque()

  def add_func(self, func):
    self._queue.append(func)

  def run(self):
    while self._queue:
      func = self._queue.popleft()
      try:
        next(func)
        self._queue.append(func)
      except StopIteration:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>usage</p>
<pre><code>func_runner = RunFunc()

func_runner.add_func(odd_till(5))
func_runner.add_func(even_till(4))
func_runner.add_func(odd_till(6))
func_runner.run()
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>output</p>
<pre><code>odd_till 5 currently: 1
even_till 4 currently: 0
odd_till 6 currently: 1
odd_till 5 currently: 3
even_till 4 currently: 2
odd_till 6 currently: 3
odd_till 6 currently: 5
</code></pre>
<p>If we rename the same thing we get a mini task scheduler [4]</p>
<pre><code>from collections import deque

class TaskScheduler:
  def __init__(self):
    self._queue = deque()

  def add_task(self, task):
    self._queue.append(task)

  def run(self):
    while self._queue:
      task = self._queue.popleft()
      try:
        next(task)
        self._queue.append(task)
      except StopIteration:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>usage</p>
<pre><code>scheduler = TaskScheduler()

scheduler.add_task(odd_till(5))
scheduler.add_task(even_till(4))
scheduler.add_task(odd_till(6))
scheduler.run()
</code></pre>
<p>Just a point of note, why do we remove a task (popleft) and readd it (append)?</p>
<pre><code>      task = self._queue.popleft()
      try:
        next(task)
        self._queue.append(task)
      except StopIteration:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>That’s because if it was finished (exception raised) well and good, it will go straight to the except block. Else the .append will get executed.</p>
<p>In other words if task terminated, don’t add it back else add it back.</p>
<h3>The send method</h3>
<p>Generators support a way of sending values to generators</p>
<pre><code>def times2():
    while True:
        val = yield
        yield val * 2

z = times2()


next(z)
print(z.send(1))
next(z)
print(z.send(2))
next(z)
print(z.send(3))
</code></pre>
<pre><code>2
4
6
</code></pre>
<p>This was an important addition. This passage explains why was send introduced and why it’s important in asyncio [6]:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Python’s generator functions are almost coroutines — but not quite — in that they allow pausing execution to produce a value, but do not provide for values or exceptions to be passed in when execution resumes … However, if it were possible to pass values or exceptions into a generator at the point where it was suspended, a simple co-routine scheduler or trampoline function would let coroutines call each other without blocking — a tremendous boon for asynchronous applications. Such applications could then write co-routines to do non-blocking socket I/O by yielding control to an I/O scheduler until data has been sent or becomes available. Meanwhile, code that performs the I/O would simply do something like this: <code>data = (yield nonblocking_read(my_socket, nbytes))</code> in order to pause execution until the <code>nonblocking_read()</code> coroutine produced a value.
</p></blockquote>
<p>yield was fundamentally changed with the addition of send.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Redefine yield to be an expression, rather than a statement. The current yield statement would become a yield expression whose value is thrown away. A yield expression’s value is None whenever the generator is resumed by a normal next() call.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Add a new send() method for generator-iterators, which resumes the generator and sends a value that …</li></ol></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The need for fast and responsive applications has never been greater because of the move from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/platform-market-share/desktop-mobile-tablet/worldwide/2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">desktop to mobile</a>. Still, web applications have been increasing in <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complexity and size</a>, with rising load times. It is therefore clear why the topic of webpage performance is more popular today than it likely ever was.</p> <p>This article aims at giving a practical introduction to the whys and hows of web performance, without getting lost in the depth or breadth of this massive topic.</p> <h2 id="why-performance-matters"><a href="#why-performance-matters">#</a> Why performance matters</h2> <p>The time it takes for a service to become usable, as well as its general responsiveness, bear a lot of weight on the user's perception of that service. Helpful features, great design and other prominent characteristics all become irrelevant when an online service is so slow that users navigate away.</p> <p>You can build the best web application in the world, but be mindful that each user will have a specific amount of time they are willing to invest in your service to solve their problems. Exceed that amount, and you risk losing them to a different, more performant solution. This is even truer for new users, who haven't yet been given proof of the quality of your service, and are essentially investing their time up-front, hoping for a return.</p> <h3 id="a-competitive-differentiator"><a href="#a-competitive-differentiator">#</a> A competitive differentiator</h3> <p>There is a brighter side to the topic: if low performance can sink an online platform, high performance can very well help it rise to the top. Speed and responsiveness can be a differentiating characteristic for a service, prompting users to choose it over the competition. Therefore an investment in this area will almost always pay off. Some notorious real-world examples from known businesses include:</p> <ol><li>Pinterest decreasing wait time for their users, <a href="https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/driving-user-growth-with-performance-improvements-cfc50dafadd7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing both traffic and conversions</a>.</li> <li>Zalando applying small improvements in load time and finding a direct correlation with <a href="https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2018/06/loading-time-matters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased revenue per session</a>.</li> <li>The BBC discovering that every extra second that a page took to load led to 10% of <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-the-bbc-builds-websites-that-scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users leaving the page</a>.</li></ol> <h2 id="measuring-performance"><a href="#measuring-performance">#</a> Measuring performance</h2> <p>Given the importance of page performance, it is no coincidence that browsers expose a ton of insights into <a href="https://web.dev/metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance metrics</a>. Being aware of how your application scores against these <em>across time</em> will provide you the feedback you need to keep it performant for your users. There are several approaches that can be combined to achieve the best results:</p> <ol><li><em>Real user monitoring</em> to understand what performance actual end-users of your service are experiencing.</li> <li><em>Synthetic monitoring</em> to proactively gather intel on service performance, as well as to find issues before users stumble into them.</li> <li><em>Performance testing</em> to avoid releasing performance regression to production in the first place.</li> <li><em>Regular audits</em> to get an overview of your page's performance and suggestions on how to improve it, e.g. with tools such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Lighthouse</a>.</li></ol>  <p>As much as we should be striving to build performant applications, we should commit to monitoring and testing performance to enable continuous feedback and rapid intervention in case of degradation. Puppeteer and Playwright give us a great toolkit to power both synthetic monitoring and performance testing.</p> <ol><li>Access to the Web Performance APIs, especially <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerformanceNavigationTiming</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PerformanceResourceTiming</a>.</li> <li>Whenever testing against Chromium, access to the Chrome DevTools Protocol for traffic inspection, network emulation and more.</li> <li>Easy interoperability with performance libraries from the Node.js ecosystem.</li></ol> <h3 id="web-performance-apis"><a href="#web-performance-apis">#</a> Web Performance APIs</h3> <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigation Timing</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource Timing</a> performance APIs are <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C</a> specifications. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Navigation_and_resource_timings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN docs</a> very clearly define the scope of both:</p> <blockquote><p>Navigation timings are metrics measuring a browser's document navigation events. Resource timings are detailed network timing measurements regarding the loading of an application's resources. Both provide the same read-only properties, but navigation timing measures the main document's timings whereas the resource timing provides the times for all the assets or resources called in by that main document and the resources' requested resources.</p></blockquote> <p>We can use the Navigation Timing API to retrieve timestamps of key events in the page load timeline.</p>  <p>The Resource Timing API allows us to zoom in to single resources and get accurate information about how quickly they are being loaded. For example, we could specifically look at our website's logo:</p>  <h3 id="chrome-devtools-for-performance"><a href="#chrome-devtools-for-performance">#</a> Chrome DevTools for performance</h3> <p>The Chrome DevTools Protocol offers many great performance tools for us to leverage together with Puppeteer and Playwright.</p> <p>One important example is network throttling, through which we can simulate the experience of users accessing our page with different network conditions.</p>  <p>The DevTools Protocol is quite extensive. We recommend exploring the <a href="https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation</a> and getting a comprehensive overview of its capabilities.</p> <h3 id="additional-performance-libraries"><a href="#additional-performance-libraries">#</a> Additional performance libraries</h3> <p>Lighthouse can easily be used programmatically with Playwright and Puppeteer to gather values and scores for different metrics, like <a href="https://web.dev/interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time To Interactive (TTI)</a>:</p>  <h2 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading">#</a> Further reading</h2> <ol><li>The comprehensive <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Performance documentation</a></li> <li><a href="https://web.dev/learn/#performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev's performance section</a></li> <li><a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/puppeteer-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Performance Recipes With Puppeteer</a> by Addy Osmani</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/aslushnikov/getting-started-with-cdp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting started with Chrome DevTools Protocol</a> by Andrey Lushnikov</li> <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse#get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Started with Google Lighthouse</a></li></ol></div></div>]]>

All species of whale have their own distinct set of sounds, and acoustic matching is frequently used to identify whale species; but what happens when you pick up a sound that no one has ever heard before? In Sea Shepherds case, they decided to send a crew to check it out and find the source of the sound. They <em>never</em> expected to discover a new species in the process.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-e6u0c"><span>The Sound of a New Species</span></h2><p id="viewer-d0g91"><span>If the sound was previously unidentified, then why were the scientists so surprised to find a new species? Wouldn't it seem that a new sound and new species go hand in hand?</span></p><p id="viewer-bv409"><span>Well, the group of researchers, which included Jay Barlow, Elizabeth Henderson, and Gustavo Cardenas Hinojosa (a beaked whale expert) matched the sound to a likely candidate; the Perrins Beaked Whale. In 2018, they received a prior set of unidentified acoustic signals from the San Benito islands which the researchers expected to be from the Perrins Beaked Whale - so in their recent pursuit, this is what they expected to find. The Perrins Beaked Whale is an extremely rare type of whale characterized by only six specimens, many of which were observed in a stranding (carcasses washed up on shore); a species with an incredibly small amount of data and information - a problem that is unfortunately not uncommon when dealing with marine sciences.</span></p><p id="viewer-ei3c8"><span>So, when the research team arrived on site, they were pleasantly shocked and surprised to see what was there to greet them; three friendly, unidentified beaked whales! According to the scientists, the whales approached the ship up to three times, which made it easy for them to record data. Aside from the sightings of the beaked whales, the scientists were able to record acoustic data, take photographs and video, and collect genetic samples. The experts claim to easily be able to confirm, based on morphology and acoustics, that the whales are a new species - however, to be perfectly clear, genetic testing on the samples will need to be conducted to classify and describe the new species. These samples were taken as eDNA - a new, fancy technique in which gallons of the surrounding water is captured and filtered for bits of DNA which can then be cross-checked against the DNA of known species. As Sea Shepherd is known for their care for whales and other marine mammals, this is the best method for them to use as it poses no risk to the specimen.</span></p><p id="viewer-94u0b"><span>To hear it from <a href="https://seashepherd.org/news/sea-shepherd-research-mission-discovers-possible-new-species-of-whale-in-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>the researchers</u></a>, <span>“We saw something new. Something that was not expected in this area, something that doesn’t match, either visually or acoustically, anything that is known to exist,” said Dr. Jay Barlow. “It just sends chills up and down my spine when I think that we might have accomplished what most people would say was truly impossible – finding a large mammal that exists on this earth that is totally unknown to science.”</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6lno8"><span><span>As the scientific name has not yet been given, the common name is up to the general public. Common names are given to a species of fish, usually based on looks, and usually have nothing to do with the scientific name - TheVast supports the suggested name "Fortune Whale", because they may be a sign of good fortune riding the waves at the end of the notorious year, 2020!

A notable example would be dolphins, which most people may be familiar with. The odontocete whale uses air (sometimes recycled) to produce the sounds, pushing it through the <strong>phonic lips</strong> (located above the head) which contract and compress to cause vibrations in the membrane, which then passes into the <strong>melon</strong> (the bulbous protrusion of the whale's forehead; again think dolphin) which condenses, shapes, and projects the vibrations into the water like a beam. Pretty incredible, right? Sonar in the Navy works in a similar way. A great example of how the natural world can inform human mechanics and developments to increase our potential or lead to more innovation. </span></p><p id="viewer-8gukb"><span>If you enjoy reading this type of content as much as we like producing it, you should seriously consider following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/TheVastNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Twitter</u></a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheVastNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Facebook</u></a>, as well as subscribing to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC87f-kaURLLfrTRaLD0IWkA?view_as=subscriber" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Youtube channel</u></a> to keep up with all of our articles and videos.

<h3>PowerLevel10k</h3>
<p>Time to spice up the terminal with a nice theme.  </p>
<p>But before that, Install the recommended font 'Meslo Nerd Font':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why?<br>
<em>Icons will render properly with this font</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can download the fonts from this <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k">GitHub</a> page.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install a font, open it and click install button on top</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Install PowerLevel10k</h4>
<p>Now, for PowerLevel10k, you can follow the guide at <a href="https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k">https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k</a></p>
<p>Below are the steps I've taken:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Installation of PowerLevel10k for Oh My Zsh</p>
<pre><code>git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/powerlevel10k
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Set <code>ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"</code> in <code>~/.zshrc</code>.  </li>
<li>Restart the Ubuntu app.  </li>
<li>You will be prompted with the configuration wizard for PowerLevel10k. If not, type <code>p10k configure</code> if the configuration wizard doesn't start automatically.  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Choose a terminal</h3>
<p>So far we have just configured a shell, zsh in this case.  </p>
<p>Time to pick a terminal of choice.  </p>
<p>Terminals are dumb. They are just UI layer. They take input and pass it on (to a shell for example).
You can choose any terminal like Hyper, cmder, Windows Terminal etc etc.</p>
<p>Up till now, we have been using the Ubuntu app as our terminal. You can continue using that and it works fine.  </p>
<p>In case you want to switch, below i have notes on few of them.  </p>

			<p><span>S</span><a title="Drop Cap" tabindex="-1" target="_blank"></a>afe, effective, and available vaccines are the best long-term solution to the coronavirus pandemic.<sup>1</sup> So it’s welcome news that two vaccines are poised for distribution and others will soon be on their way. Preliminary clinical trial data from these two vaccines, made by Pfizer and Moderna, indicate the vaccines are effective at stimulating a strong and long-lasting response against the virus responsible for COVID-19. A recent FDA briefing<sup>2</sup> confirmed the efficacy and safety profile of Pfizer’s vaccine, reiterating the shot was 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 after two doses with no serious safety concerns.</p><p>This is all good news, but it’s still unlikely that a vaccine will be widely distributed until mid 2021. Supply constraints could cause additional delays.<sup>3</sup> In the meantime, health professionals must continue to develop, trial, and improve the therapeutic management of COVID-19, and people must continue to attenuate transmission through social distancing and adherence to recommended public health practices such as wearing a mask and avoiding crowded indoor activities.</p><blockquote><p>Fear of a disease does not always translate into high vaccination rates.</p> </blockquote><p>Looming over our best efforts, however, is a factor that could derail the campaign to end the pandemic: distrust of vaccines. In a survey of 1,000 individuals in New York City in April 2020, at the height of the epidemic’s first wave, only 59 percent of respondents said they would get a vaccine, and only 53 percent would have their children vaccinated.<sup>4</sup> The large public and private investments in developing vaccines need to be matched by investments in laying the groundwork for vaccine acceptance.<br></p><p>Much is at stake. If the vaccination roll out is to succeed, it behooves us to be sensitive to general perceptions about vaccination. COVID-19 vaccination has to be viewed within the broader context of attitudes toward routine immunization. An effective and safe vaccine that stops the pandemic and restores our ability to resume social, educational, and economic activity could improve public attitudes toward science and enhance vaccine acceptance more generally. Issues around public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination could influence immunization campaigns for years to come.</p><p><span>V</span>accine hesitancy in the United States now ranges from narrow concerns about specific vaccines to broad coalitions of “anti-vaxxers” who reject all vaccines. The roots of these sentiments, most without scientific basis, run deep. The continual expansion of vaccines for children (from seven vaccines 40 years ago to 15 today) is mistakenly thought to burden young immune systems. Other factors include suspicion about the financial motives of the vaccine industry, mistrust of scientific evidence and government institutions,<sup>5,6</sup> the effect of vaccine vehicles on neurological disorders, and the distrust in vaccines deliberately sown by Russian-linked social media accounts.<sup>7</sup> The result: Even though annual flu shots are available at most neighborhood pharmacies, fewer than half of Americans now receive a flu shot each year.<sup>8</sup></p><p>Reluctance to get vaccinated for COVID-19 is widespread. Only two-thirds of crowdsourced participants (68.2 percent) in a survey of Canadians reported being very likely to voluntarily get vaccinated.<sup>9</sup> In Israel, people who had received influenza vaccinations in regular years were more likely to report that they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine, but others were hesitant.<sup>10</sup> A nationally representative study in Ireland and the United Kingdom reported vaccine hesitancy for 26 percent and 25 percent of respondents, and resistance for 9 percent and 6 percent, respectively.<sup>11</sup> A survey of 450 Americans found that 67 percent would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if one were recommended by the government. Males (72 percent), adults over 55 (78 percent), Asians (81 percent), and college and/or graduate degree holders (75 percent) were more likely to accept a vaccine.<sup>12</sup> Other surveys have indicated that 35 percent of Americans would not accept a COVID-19 vaccine even if one were available today.<sup>13</sup></p><blockquote><p>Mandatory vaccination should be avoided. Vaccination status should be tied to travel or access to public places.</p> </blockquote><p>Vaccine hesitancy may not be uniform for all age groups. Parents are more reluctant to vaccinate their children than themselves,<sup>14</sup> but children have been found to be key spreaders of infection and should arguably be among the priority groups to be vaccinated, especially if the antibody response is weak in the elderly population.<br></p><p>Attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccine are still evolving. People’s preferences are a function of the perceived safety and efficacy of a vaccine, and the health burden and outcomes related to the disease—both of which could change. The virus may mutate and become less (or more) virulent. An effective therapeutic may depress the perceived need to be vaccinated, since individuals in good health are often willing to risk getting ill and receive treatment rather than get a vaccine. Risk-benefit calculations may be shaped by new information on the long-term respiratory and neurological effects of the virus. People worldwide may develop pandemic fatigue and desire only a return to normalcy.</p><p>The perceived risk posed by the infectious agent is a major motivator for vaccination,<sup>15</sup> and this works in favor of acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. Perceptions of personal vulnerability<sup>16</sup> and anticipated regret<sup>17</sup> are also correlated with the choice to be vaccinated, and both are likely to be high for this disease. The more effective the COVID-19 vaccine, the more likely people will choose to be vaccinated. Paradoxically, however, this could reduce vaccine uptake over time if the incidence of COVID-19 declines.<sup>18</sup> Fear of a disease does not always translate into high vaccination rates, as a study of tetanus in the 1960s showed.<sup>19</sup></p><p><span>W</span>idespread vaccination against COVID-19 requires that scientists and healthcare workers go beyond just providing information: The issue is not simply a matter of educating people about the importance of vaccination. A more sophisticated approach is needed to address convenience, affordability, and trust in public institutions.</p><p>The first hurdle is engendering confidence in the vaccine development process. The speed at which the first vaccines have been developed could itself prove a barrier to vaccine acceptance. The language of “Warp Speed,” intended to communicate urgency, unintentionally signals a prioritization of urgency over safety. In this context, the commitment of pharma CEOs to “only submit for approval or emergency use authorization after demonstrating safety and efficacy through a phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities such as FDA” inspires confidence.<sup>20</sup> The advantages of getting a vaccine to market quickly could be squandered if too many people believe it has been rushed to market without adequate safety and efficacy testing. Time is wasted if they need to be convinced otherwise. Communicating the vaccine’s safety and efficacy is critical. Without this, even healthcare workers may be reluctant to be vaccinated.<sup>10</sup></p><div>

</div><p>Second, trust in public authorities is likely to be a significant factor.<sup>10</sup> People with diminished trust in the country’s leaders are far less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. Public officials, community leaders, celebrities, and their families should themselves get vaccinated and be transparent in a nonlegalistic, commonsensical manner about the risks and benefits. Trusted voices must be used to improve public understanding. The enthusiastic declaration by three former U.S. presidents that they want to be among those receiving the vaccine will hopefully inspire other influencers to step forward.</p><p>Third, it is important to find local solutions to vaccine hesitancy. Demographic and geographic disparities in vaccine acceptance could lead to creating clusters of unvaccinated individuals who could then sustain repeated outbreaks of COVID-19. Achieving a high national average vaccination coverage rate would then not be sufficient. A targeted approach to messaging and improving coverage could expedite our exit from the pandemic.</p><blockquote><p>Surveys have indicated 35 percent of Americans would not accept a COVID-19 vaccine.</p> </blockquote><p>Fourth, mandatory vaccination policies should be avoided because they could backfire. More acceptable would be tying vaccination status to travel or access to public places. Such policies preserve individual agency to reject the vaccine while also protecting public health, much like regulations that prohibit smoking in public places: Individuals can do as they like in private.<br></p><p>Finally, social media should be used to help shape preferences around COVID-19 vaccination and counter those who oppose vaccines under any circumstances. Researchers found that 54 percent of anti-vaccination ads on Facebook came from just two organizations: the World Mercury Project and Stop Mandatory Vaccinations.<sup>21</sup> Facebook’s recent pledge to remove discredited claims about COVID-19 vaccinations<sup>22</sup> could be a significant step toward countering misinformation from these groups, despite the inherent difficulties around detecting, discerning, and removing misinformation at scale.<sup>23</sup></p><p>Another study<sup>24</sup> found that anti-vaccine groups were small and had few followers but were more likely to be linked into social media of decision-making bodies, such as parent associations at schools. Emotive and fear-based online messages are seeding doubt about vaccines and gaining disproportionate strength over neutral, scientific postings.</p><p><span>T</span>here is little time to lose in the campaign to end the …</p></div></div>

It may very well be that, among all your sense organs, your nose would register the starkest change.</p><p>Even so, it’s a tricky thing to pin down smellscapes of the past. Smells are notoriously fickle. They are not suited for permanent capture or easily imagined. Odors are caused by airborne compounds emanating from materials. The moment you open a perfume bottle it releases the very volatiles of which it is composed. (A <a href="https://www.museesdegrasse.com/en/history-international-perfume-museum" target="_blank">museum of historical perfumes</a> would come to a foreseeable end if it adopted an open-bottle policy.) That’s why the sensory recreation of history presents an intriguing scientific challenge<sup>1</sup>: How do we know whether we’ve succeeded?</p><figure data-alt="Barwich_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18009_e25f50c93d321b7fdff05757de426238.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>SCENTS AND SENSIBILITIES:</strong> Using state of the art techniques in history research, a new project called Odeuropa aims to conserve the smells of Europe’s past. You can watch a video introduction <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6iMmeFLvhg" target="blank">here</a>.</span><span>odeuropa.eu</span></figcaption></figure><p>That’s a question with which the minds behind “<a href="https://odeuropa.eu/" target="_blank">Odeuropa</a>” will have to grapple. Launching this January, it is a $3.3 million, three-year, multinational project on the collection and recreation of smells in 16th- to early 20th-century Europe that will marry historical and literary analysis with machine learning and chemistry. The project is pioneering and also, in a year of COVID-19 induced anosmia with sensory-deprived lockdowns, timely.<sup>2</sup> We became aware of our need for environmental stimulation—and the undervalued power of smell.<br></p><p>The difficulty is that descriptions of past scents are people’s stated impressions. Labels express conceptualizations. They are not the same as perceptions. They also may not tell us specifically what materials were present. As horticulturalists know, a rose by any other name consists of hundreds of different volatiles and miscellaneous fragrant notes. The smells of Bulgarian roses are not the same as the roses in Kew Garden London.</p><blockquote><p>Smell can enhance the feeling of visiting the past.</p> </blockquote><p>Descriptions of odor also are culturally mediated. A 2016 study showed that even French and Franco-Canadians today may not agree in their experience and evaluation of the same odor<sup>3</sup>: For the French, for example, wintergreen was rated much less pleasantly than for French-Canadians. “In France, wintergreen is used more in medicinal products than in Canada, where it is found more in candy,” a press release for the study stated. “Anise was rated similarly in two cultures but was described more often as ‘licorice’ in Quebec and as ‘anise’ in France.” Intricate cross-cultural differences make for intriguing anecdotes. But they are hard to document.<br></p><p>That’s part of the reason why history is built on preserving enduring visual and tactile artifacts, such as paintings, writings, architectural sites, or simply stones and bones. What’s missing is the material sensation of immediate reality that only direct sensory contact seems to provide. It is no coincidence that signs reading, “Please, don’t touch the artifacts (no, seriously, don’t do it),” are plastered around museums. Yet we deprive ourselves of connecting with humanity’s past by focusing on materials stripped of their sensory dimensions.</p><p><span>O</span>deuropa opens up a new sensory experience of history. The researchers will create a catalog of past scents by digging through 250,000 images and thousands of texts (in seven languages), ranging from medical descriptions of smells in textbooks to labels of fragrances in novels or magazines. Machine learning will help to cross-analyze the plethora of descriptions, contexts, and occurrence of odor names (such as tobacco, lavender, and probably horse manure). This catalog serves as the conceptual basis for perfumers and chemists to create fragrant molecules fitting 120 of these descriptors.</p><p>Such recreation poses an experimental challenge that is worth following over the next couple of years. Previous experimental recreations of past scents involved the synthesis of similar compounds (if you have their chemical structure and qualitative descriptors—for example of preserved rare samples). Or it might involve blending currently available compounds into mixtures that resemble a specific description of a historical smell.</p><blockquote><p>Developing a better sense of the past and its loss may help us preserve and enrich the sensory present.</p> </blockquote><p>How to design a museum of scents? Part of the answer already exists. Mandy Aftel, a natural perfumer and author of the 2014 book <i>Fragrant</i>, curates in Berkeley, California, a <a href="https://www.aftelier.com/Articles.asp?ID=256" target="_blank">library of curious scents</a>. <i>The New York Times</i> said the place “manages to contain the olfactory history of the world: hundreds of natural essences, raw ingredients and antique tinctures gathered from every corner of the globe, and all available for visitors to smell.” Odeuropa identifies an omission that it aims to rectify: the increasing absence of <i>material</i> presence that smells seem to convey. Smells may seem intangible and immaterial to many people. But what is the last thing that people give away of their beloved departed? Their clothes, carrying the last intimate trace of a person’s being: their scent.<br></p><p>Part of the Odeuropa team is a research project called Smell of Heritage, carried out by Cecilia Bembibre, a doctoral student in heritage science at University College London. Heritage scientists look to come up with new ways to study materials and collections that make up cultural heritage, as well as how the environment interacts with it. Bembibre, for example, analyzes and archives culturally essential aromas. “In the heritage context,” the <a href="http://www.smellofheritage.org/heritage.html" target="_blank">Smell of Heritage website</a> states, “experiencing what the world smelled like in the past enriches our knowledge of it, and, because of the unique relation between odors and memories, allows us to engage with our history in a more emotional way.”</p><div>

</div><p>Preservationists ignored this for a long time. “A tradition of denigration of the sense of smell can be traced back to the Enlightenment,” the preservationist-artist Jorge Otero-Pailos wrote in a 2016 paper, “and there is still surprisingly little serious research on a topic that, on the face of things, might be central to the discipline.”<sup>4</sup></p><p>Anyone living abroad traveling back home can tell you that each culture, every area, all localities have their unique smellscape: the particular foods and spices (street vendors, bakeries, family recipes), and the various kinds of industrial fumes or plant emanations. I really know I am back in Germany, not when the plane has landed (or I hear the announcement in its unmistakably staccato melody), but when I pass the scent of dusty cold cigarette smoke at Frankfurt airport’s train station.<br></p><blockquote><p>We should not forget about our desire to sensually experience.</p> </blockquote><p>Otero-Pailos’ preservationist art captures and illuminates this sort of experience. On his website, Otero-Pailos writes, “I gravitate towards monuments, the objects that entire cultures latch onto in order to transition into new phases, to remember, to celebrate, to come together.” By preserving smells in architectural sites, his work creates a platform to investigate the environmental and cultural history of buildings as active and abandoned social sites.<br></p><p>Such research helps uncover and evaluate the impact of the world’s changing materiality on society. Fish or meat markets and olfactorily rich gardens have vanished (when have you last experienced a rose that actually carries a <i>deep</i> rose smell?). They made way for shops selling electronics and bubble tea. Smells present sensory witnesses of the materials in our environment. Policies often originate in these environmental signals instead of abstract societal models. You may have escaped some stinks of the past, but you are benefitting from their consequences. For example, according to the historian Melanie Kiechle, fears of industrial fumes and stench in late 19th-century America prompted countermeasures.<sup>5</sup> One was creating a green lung at the heart of a densely populated metropolis—marking Central Park’s birth in Manhattan.</p><p>The historian and author of <i>Smell in the Eighteenth Century</i> William Tullett, also part of the Odeuropa project, highlights the importance of thinking about authenticity in both its sensory and historical expression. With historic spaces, smell can help lend a sense of authenticity to the experience of being there. It enhances the feeling of visiting the past, and thereby a more enduring appreciation for it. Can we experience these smells just as our historical predecessors did? That might be a stretch. A Parisian in the 18th century won’t share the same judgment of the fumes of rotten fish with the same foreign fascination as our weary time traveler. That is the inherent cognitive challenge of smell—a challenge that now presents an opportunity for sensory exploration.</p><p><span>T</span>here is a wondrous irony that smell, <i>the</i> sense associated with memory (and Proust’s overexposed madeleine), has been sidelined in our recollections of history. Our autobiographical memories are filled with vivid smell episodes—the dust-rubber cloud in my father’s garage, the bittersweet whiff of that cheap perfume of your teenage crush ... The sense of smell also poses interesting neuroscientific puzzles here. It is the only sense that bypasses the thalamus and has almost immediate access to the core cortex—including the hypothalamus, involved in the processing of new memories and associative learning. How the <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/91/the-amazing-brain/our-mind_boggling-sense-of-smell" target="_blank">brain makes sense of scents</a> has only recently garnered proper attention. How the brain makes memories with scent now makes for the next neural frontier.<sup>6</sup></p><p>Developing a better sense of the past and its loss may help us preserve and enrich the sensory present. Modern life, in the 21st century, has a different sense of materiality than in the past—including the past of the previous …</p></div></div>

<p>So, you’ve downloaded and installed <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS Studio</a> on your computer and you want to start recording your screen, but you’re lost?</p>



<p>Well, simply <strong>follow this step-by-step tutorial and you will be ready to start recording high-quality videos of your screen in no time with OBS Studio</strong>. </p>



<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<hr>



<h2>A Brief Overview of OBS Studio</h2>



<p>Before we go further, let’s get an idea of the GUI layout of OBS Studio. To keep things simple, we will divide OBS Studio into 6 sections.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="550" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=768%2C412&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1536%2C825&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1200%2C644&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?w=1598&amp;ssl=1 1598w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20550'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=300%2C161&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=768%2C412&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1536%2C825&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1200%2C644&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?w=1598&amp;ssl=1 1598w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/obs-screen.png?resize=1024%2C550&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<h3>1. Scenes</h3>



<p>If OBS is a canvas, <code>Scenes</code> would be a place that stores various pictures you can switch at any time. Each scene is used for different purposes. For example, a streamer would use different ones to signify when he is playing, waiting in a lobby, or taking a break.</p>



<h3>2. Sources</h3>



<p>You can think of <code>Sources</code> like a set of colors, you use to paint a scene. These are all of the elements shown on your screen during a recording. A good example of Sources are your logo, webcam, and chat window.</p>



<h3>3. Audio Mixer</h3>



<p>The mixer is where you will set up everything audio-related. More on that later.</p>



<h3>4. Scene Transitions</h3>



<p>Transitions provide you with animations you can play while switching up the scenes.</p>



<h3>5. Controls</h3>



<p>This houses the most important controls you will use to manipulate your recording.</p>



<h3>6. Preview Window</h3>



<p>Finally, there is a Preview Window. This shows exactly what you will see after you’ve recorded your video.</p>



<p>And don’t forget that OBS Studio is really customizable. You can drag and drop all of these windows and re-organize them to create a unique layout that suits your workflow.</p>



<p>Great, now that you have an idea of what hte OBS Studio layout looks like, let’s get started with setting up OBS Studio for recording.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Setup OBS Studio for Recording Your Screen</h2>



<p>Now let’s follow this step-by-step procedure to setup OBS Studio and start recording! </p>



<h3>1. Add Audio Sources</h3>



<p>Let’s start by setting up the audio. First, go to the <code>Controls &gt; Settings &gt; Audio</code>. Set both <code>Desktop Audio</code> and <code>Mic Audio</code> to <code>default</code>. Everything else should be disabled.</p>

<p>Let’s quickly add some filters to make your voice sound more professional. Click on the gear icon next to <code>Mic/Aux</code> in <code>Audio Mixer</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img width="742" height="431" src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=742%2C431&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?w=742&amp;ssl=1 742w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20742%20431'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?w=742&amp;ssl=1 742w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Filter.png?resize=742%2C431&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Here we have 3 options: <code>Noise Suppression</code>, <code>Noise Gate</code>, and <code>Gain</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img width="598" height="257" src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=598%2C257&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20598%20257'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?w=598&amp;ssl=1 598w, https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/0_4ByvJMTJqxt68LJG_.png?resize=598%2C257&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<ul><li><strong>Noise Suppression</strong> will remove most of your background noise. Start from -10 dB and drop lower until you can’t hear the noise.</li><li><strong>Noise Gate</strong> will turn off your microphone when the volume drops below the Close Threshold. This way you won’t record your breathing. Settings will vary depending on your type of mic, so play with it until it feels natural.</li><li><strong>Gain</strong> is used for changing the volume of your mic.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Choose Recording Quality</h3>



<p>Go to the <code>Output</code> tab on the left and under <code>Recording</code> choose the path where OBS will save all your videos. By default, it’s set to <code>\Users\OBS\Videos</code>.</p>

<p>If you are just beginning to record your videos, we recommend that you choose <code>High Quality</code>. This will provide you with pretty good quality and reasonable file size.</p>



<p>Others should pick <code>Indistinguishable Quality</code>. This will give you a fully professional video that you can later edit in post-processing.</p>



<p>We can’t really recommend <code>Lossless</code> as it will eat up your storage without providing a perceptible difference.</p>



<p>Under <code>Recording Format</code> choose either <code>MKV</code> or <code>FLV</code> as they are very stable container formats. In case your PC or PBS crashes, you will likely be able to save your recording. </p>

<p>You can easily convert your files later, by going to <code>File &gt; Remux Recording</code>.</p>

<h3>3. Add Scenes</h3>



<p>Now, you will want to create a game scene by clicking on the plus sign in <code>Scenes</code>. A new window will pop up where you can name it.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20576'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scenes.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<h3>4. Capture Your Game</h3>



<p>After creating an in-game scene, keep it selected and click on the <code>+</code> sign in <code>Sources</code>, and select <code>Game Capture</code>. This will open up the properties and let you pick which game you want to record.</p>



<div><figure><img width="562" height="380" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=562%2C380&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?w=562&amp;ssl=1 562w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20562%20380'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?w=562&amp;ssl=1 562w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=300%2C203&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-Capture.png?resize=562%2C380&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>For <code>Mode</code> make sure it’s set to <code>Capture</code> any fullscreen application. Once you start playing your game, OBS will automatically focus on it.</p>



<p>Nowadays, many games have an anti-cheat system that might affect OBS Studio. For this reason, you should select <code>Use anti-cheat compatibility hook</code>. Don’t worry, you won’t get banned for it.</p>



<p>If you enable 3rd party overlays like Discord or Steam, OBS will try and capture them as well. However, this does not always work, so make sure to check the preview window.</p>



<div><figure><img width="717" height="605" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=717%2C605&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?w=717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20717%20605'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?w=717&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/OBS-capture.png?resize=717%2C605&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Once you are done with the setup, click OK and exit. Your game should now be displayed in the OBS.</p>



<h3>5. Add your Webcam</h3>



<p>Go back to the <code>+</code> sign in <code>Sources</code> and select <code>Video Capture Device</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img width="500" height="393" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=500%2C393&amp;ssl=1" alt="Set up OBS Studio for Recording" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20393'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=300%2C236&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Video-Capture.png?resize=500%2C393&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>That will take you to the <code>Properties</code>. Make sure that you select the right webcam and OBS will set it up. By default, <code>Resolution Type</code> is set to custom. If you want to change it, we recommend choosing either <code>1080p</code> or <code>720p</code>. Hit <code>OK</code> and your webcam will appear under <code>Scenes</code>. Just drag it where you want and resize if needed.</p>



<p>And that’s it! You are now ready to start recording videos in OBS Studio.</p>



<p>Hope you were able to follow this guide and set up your computer to record using <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS Studio</a>. Have fun recording your screen, or games! Let us know if you have any tips for setting up your OBS Studio installation and we’ll publish it. Thanks! </p>

<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>Last night we watched <em>Cosmos: Possible Worlds, Season 3, Episode 9,</em> on Hulu, hosted by Neil DeGrasse Tyson. In this episode, he talks about a theory called “super determinism.” He leads into the idea by discussing the nature of light, as both particle and wave. The photon is the particle aspect. The wave aspect, as I understand it, has everything to do with quantum superposition. The photon’s position manifests as a result of statistical probability. The most probable event is what we perceive, and we perceive the most probable event—if I’ve got that right.</p>
<p>Wow. I won’t even pretend to understand the actual physics, but I’m going to play with it anyway. In fact, Tyson says, in his trademark ecstatic manner, that not understanding this stuff shouldn’t preclude anyone from using it. Great!</p>
<p>Here’s the rundown, then, as I understand it:</p>
<p><a href="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_2003066-small-credit-e1607443483420.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_2003066-small-credit-e1607443483420.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="145" srcset="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_2003066-small-credit-e1607443483420.jpg 340w, https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_2003066-small-credit-e1607443483420-300x218.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></a>A photon is a discrete packet of energy that moves. Surprisingly, photons can split into lower-energy pairs (according to results of double-slit experiments).</p>
<p>As I watched Tyson talk about photons, I recalled another documentary’s discussion of the journey a single photon takes from its birthplace in the core of our sun to the Earth. That journey takes an enormous amount of time, up to a million years or more, almost all of which happens inside the sun, where the photon keeps getting absorbed and re-emitted. When the photon finally escapes, it takes a little over eight minutes to reach the Earth. Crazy. So, I found it interesting, listening to Tyson, that these other documentaries talked of a single individual photon bumping around inside our sun, when it looks to me like it’s not the same photon at all, but the transference of a photon-amount of energy. But maybe I’m quibbling. Or maybe I’m missing something. I’ve probably missed something.</p>
<p>I’ll carry on…</p>
<p>So, with the above life-cycle of a photon in mind, the paired photons Tyson’s talking about must be ones that have experienced no interruption between start and finish, no interference in any way. He’s talking about uninterrupted travel. From stars, presumably. Or black holes? (My husband is shouting this from the other room.) This non-interference is relevant because photon pairs, when they occur, are entangled. That’s right: “spooky action at a distance.” And observation breaks the entanglement.</p>
<p><a href="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_268369708-small-cred.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_268369708-small-cred-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212" srcset="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_268369708-small-cred-300x212.jpg 300w, https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_268369708-small-cred.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>What does entanglement mean? Whatever one of the two photons does/is, which Tyson calls its “spin” (for sanity’s sake, consider “spin” a placeholder), which is to say its “information” state, remains the same or changes simultaneously with its twin. The photons don’t communicate; they’re tied. In fact, he says, some entangled pairs may have been travelling across the universe for billions of years.</p>
<p>This BBC article by Philip Ball illustrates the trouble with observation and entanglement: “<a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170215-the-strange-link-between-the-human-mind-and-quantum-physics">The strange link between the human mind and quantum physics</a>.” In the Cosmos episode, Tyson never gives a good explanation of what “observation” is, which bothered me. Helpfully, the article explains why scientists are uncomfortable talking about it, that the observation at issue is probably not a mechanical interference at all, rather it’s the actual <em>mental</em> process of perceiving. Truly spooky! Apparently, we don’t know how to observe quantum particles without <em>touching</em> in this mysterious way. (With that said, can these photon pairs be interfered with and still maintain their spin, if not observed?)</p>
<p>You may ask: how do scientists know the photon pairs were entangled in the first place if observation breaks the entanglement and it doesn’t matter when in the sequence of time (before or after) observation takes place? Obliquely, I assume.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this NPR article, which I stumbled across before the episode, talks about light, too: “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/936219170/scientists-discover-outer-space-isnt-pitch-black-after-all?utm_term=nprnews&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;fbclid=IwAR3UwjMtmHEpHBjv2SWmD3ZDkyg89x7DgN4pDgsVdp8XSt7bpl70Q03DZNM">Scientists Discover Outer Space isn’t Pitch Black After All</a>”. In it, Nell Greenfieldboyce describes the possibility that the blackness between stars isn’t really black at all, rather radiating with an amount of light equal to that of all the known galaxies. The universe itself may radiate light, she says, or there may be some other new and unknown source emitting the light. But I couldn’t help wondering whether the light is a reflection. A reflection that includes severed photon twins? If so, do they retain their original information/spin? I have no idea, but how fascinating it would be if we could read them in this oblique way.</p>
<p><a href="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_229938857-small-cred.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_229938857-small-cred-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>Back to the Cosmos episode: After the photon pairs, Tyson brings in “super determinism.” He suggests that the independence from space-time of these photons means our universe is not a constantly expanding multiverse of infinite vectoring possibilities, as described by the Many-Worlds Theory, but rather lies in a single, settled, and simultaneous state…</p>
<p>Okay, at this point, I’m really stuck on the idea that observation severs the entanglement of photon pairs. What does it mean to <em>observe?</em> Who’s doing the observing? Is consciousness the underlying fabric of the entire universe? Sounds a lot like “a being than which nothing better can be conceived.” Are the observed/to-be-observed parts of our universe in a collapsed state, and other parts not? Sounds like solipsism.</p>
<p><a href="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_303614322-cropped-small-cred.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_303614322-cropped-small-cred-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>In Episode 9, after introducing super determinism, Tyson jokes, as many have, about how terrible it would be and pointless to make decisions if everything has been predetermined. Why bother? But I wish he’d tried to explain what super determinism means cosmologically as it relates to us. I mean, here’s <em>The Matrix</em>’s take when the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVF4kebiks4">Oracle speaks to Neo</a> after he breaks the vase: “What’s really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you have broken it if I hadn’t said anything?”</p>
<p>Is it absolutely necessary to cling to an idea of indeterminism in order to strive?</p>
<p>As I see us, all our worries, concerns, and efforts are integral to who we are. It’s how we’re made. Imagine an old bridge. Just because we can’t see exactly when a bridge is going to collapse, doesn’t mean the bridge won’t collapse at a particular time. But we can hope that the bridge will last a few more minutes, in time for us to make it across. From our linear-time perspective, the bridge might or might not collapse under us, so we’d <em>better</em> hurry.</p>
<p>But in a deterministic universe, according to Tyson, joking or not, hurrying makes no difference. If we’re not slated to make it in time, then we won’t.</p>
<p>That’s ridiculous. He must know it. A predetermined universe we cannot directly perceive has nothing to do with individual agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_271932851-small-cred.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_271932851-small-cred-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>We will always play a part. <em>Our</em> part. There’s no way around it. We were always going to worry that the bridge was going to collapse, and we were always going to hurry or not, for all the reasons that we did hurry, or didn’t, and the bridge is going to and did collapse for all the reasons that made the bridge collapse. They’re all connected. Our part in the makeup of the universe is that we live and function within it. We’re both cause and effect, like ripples that peter out. Or wave interference patterns. It really doesn’t matter that the universe is deterministic—if it is. And if it is, the universe is like a bubble of instantaneity, within which time-space gives shape to our lives and perceptions.</p>
<p>We can’t take ourselves out of the equation. Our free will is part of the universe. We are choosing—and have chosen.</p>
<p><a href="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_61796751-cropped-small-cred.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dawntrowelljones.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-08-AdobeStock_61796751-cropped-small-cred-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>I’d argue, in answer to my question above—“Is it absolutely necessary to cling to an idea of indeterminism in order to strive?”—that striving is a linear reflection of a universe that’s more than linear. Dancing seems a better analogy. We dance. Like Shiva as Nataraja in Hinduism, who perpetually dances the universe into being.</p>
<p>Indulge me for a minute here, if you will. I’m going to defend astrology for a second. Tyson would be miffed, I’m sure—if he knew. It’s a sentiment most scientists share. (He spoke of astrology in an earlier <em>Cosmos: Possible Worlds</em> episode.)</p>
<p>Based on what I’ve now learned, I can only assume that any star generating light might radiate some light in the form of paired photons, which carry the information undisturbed in different directions until affected by something—that is, “observed,” at some point in time. We’re talking about starlight. Astrologers’ deal with starlight from an Earth-bound perspective. Stars do not have “personality”, of course, as Tyson makes clear. I’m far from the most informed about astrology, but if an astrologer asserted that they did, I’d treat it as a metaphor to represent the human personality traits “tweaked” by a particular configuration of stars and planets at a particular time. In this context, references to gods and myth should be viewed as placeholders—like “singularities,” “God Particles,” and “particle/waves”—a way to look at these traits in action as they manifest in humans on Earth in a statistically discernible pattern. Maybe. If discernible.</p>
<p>I respect real science profoundly. I simply would rather not dismiss ancient wisdom out of hand without at least trying to imagine how it might fit within our current understanding. Science doesn’t necessarily know all the forces that travel between stars. It’s always evolving, which is wonderful, as Tyson himself has said.</p>
<p>Astrologers are interested in patterns. The mind is a dynamic system in a physical case, sensitive, perhaps even on the quantum level. I’d argue that it’s within the realm of <em>possibility</em> that there may someday be scientific support for the idea that a configuration of stars and planets at the time of a person’s birth at a particular location under the sky has an identifiable effect, a cumulative effect on behavioral patterns that’s observable—one that expert astrologers have been documenting for thousands of years.</p>
<p>It’s a mistake, in my opinion, to assume our ancestors were less intelligent than we are. It may be valid, however, to assume they were ignorant of much of what we know in the way we’ve …</p></div></div>

December 9, 2020 | https://ncona.com/2020/12/running-google-firestore-locally/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncona.com/2020/12/running-google-firestore-locally/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In a previous article, <a href="https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/">we started playing with Google Firestore</a>. In this article we are going to learn how we can test our applications without the need to talk to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Note that the local version of Google Firestore is intended for testing only and shouldn’t be used for production systems. It doesn’t provide the reliability or scalability features that the real Firestore does.</p>

<h2 id="firebase-emulator-suite">Firebase emulator suite</h2>

<p>Google provides this suite to help developers test applications without having to use production data or incur cost. The suite doesn’t only emulate the database, but also cloud functions and real-time functionality, to name a couple. In this article we’re only going to focus on the Firestore database.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="firebase-cli">Firebase CLI</h2>

<p>We start by installing the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli">Firebase CLI</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then start an instance of Firestore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>firebase emulators:start --only firestore
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As part of the output we will get something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>┌───────────┬────────────────┐
│ Emulator  │ Host:Port      │
├───────────┼────────────────┤
│ Firestore │ localhost:8080 │
└───────────┴────────────────┘
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Port <code>8080</code> is the default for Firestore. When the emulator starts it will look for a file named <code>firebase.json</code> where we can override the port:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"emulators"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"firestore"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"port"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"9999"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>One important thing to keep in mind about the emulator is that the data will be lost every time the emulator is stoped.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-to-the-emulator">Connecting to the emulator</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://ncona.com/2020/12/introduction-to-google-firestore/">Introduction to Google Firestore</a> we learned how to create a firestore client:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
</pre></td><td><pre><span>// Constants necessary to create the firestore client</span>
<span>const</span> <span>GcpCredentialsFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/tmp/my-key.json"</span>
<span>const</span> <span>ProjectId</span> <span>=</span> <span>"project-12345"</span>

<span>// When done with the client, close it using:</span>
<span>// defer client.Close()</span>
<span>func</span> <span>createClient</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Context</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span><span>firestore</span><span>.</span><span>Client</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>client</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>firestore</span><span>.</span><span>NewClient</span><span>(</span><span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>ProjectId</span><span>,</span> <span>option</span><span>.</span><span>WithCredentialsFile</span><span>(</span><span>GcpCredentialsFile</span><span>))</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatalf</span><span>(</span><span>"Failed to create client: %v"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>client</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To tell our app that we want to use the emulator, we need to set an environment variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>export </span><span>FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST</span><span>=</span>localhost:8080
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will cause the credentials to be ignored, and the client will connect to the emulator instead.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a quick article to show how we can easily start a local version of Google Firestore that can be used for testing. The emulator provides a lot of advanced features, but I haven’t had the need for them, so I haven’t dived into them.</p>

<p>My intuitive answer: stability? That sort of dependable income and status you can rely on to start and support a family. Second intuition: people are bad at saving—or by the time they have enough saved, they have dependents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dependents thing is a good point, but San Francisco also has some of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/04/upshot/up-birth-age-gap.html">oldest parents</a>. Related statistic from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/webdevMason/status/1099713229989629952">Twitter</a>. This data is city wide, and I would guess that tech workers skew older than average.</p>
<p>Based on the math I did last time, you can quit a corporate tech job after a year with considerable savings, or after 5 years with around $713,000.</p>
<p>If you graduate at 22, work for 5 years, and have kids at 32, you still have another 5 years to do whatever you want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I worked at Apple for five years and met many people who felt stricken by golden handcuffs. The most common “trap” that people seemed to fall into was the classic one: jogging ever faster and faster on the hedonic treadmill.</p>
<p>Common vices included multiple vintage sports cars, buying wine at auction, multi-year construction and renovation projects, airplanes, etc. More mundane vices were also common: marrying and having several children, which often leads to a $3M+ home and a wife who no longer works. It’s easy in that situation to find oneself expenses to the tune of $300k/year if one’s not actively trying to reign things in.</p>
<p>The vices sound silly typed out like this, but as a 21 year old entering this scene, it was quite an intense thing having all my role models and more senior peers engaging in this kind of thing. In some sense, it was necessary to spend time with them: if I wanted to socialize (perhaps necessary for advancement), I’d need to go to dinner at fancy restaurants, share the wine, etc. Now, perhaps fancy meals and drinks amount to “only” $2k/mo, but it’s easy to develop a taste for such things, and then to notice the merits of your older colleagues’ interior decor…</p>
<p>It was easier for me to leave (I went to a non-profit) because what lifestyle changes I’d adopted were flexible: I could simply choose to stop going to fancy meals. Others have somewhat more disruptive stakes: selling the cars, moving to a different home, etc. <strong>I notice that when I talk to them about leaving, there’s a kind of distant wistfulness: “ah, if only…”—as if they’re imagining another life, another person, impossible for them to be.</strong> It’s a kind of complacency, I guess. [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Engineers might be particularly prone to this trap because their identity is wrapped up in their job. As Ben Kuhn writes in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.benkuhn.net/nonprog/">What happened to all the non-programmers?</a>, it’s shockingly easy to find yourself only hanging out with other engineers who have similar interests.</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://setharielgreen.com/about/">Seth Green</a> (excerpt)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>…two general thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>From a longer thread about how YC has lost its soul: “RPM at Facebook is the new IB @ goldman (and actually pays more)” (HN discussion: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23916314">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23916314</a>). If this is true, then we should expect people who take these roles to be excellent and risk-averse, which is what it takes to get into Yale or Stanford and then BCG, Goldman, YLS, HBS, Apple, etc. The funnel selects for lack of courage (also high IQ &amp; ability to grind).</p>
</li>
<li><p>How many people do you know who are just stuck in ruts, period? Perhaps they make a lot of money, feel like they’ll never ever be fired, and when they go home, they get high and play videogames every day. I know a lot more people like this than I did ten years ago (Erik Hurst attributes some of the declining work share among young men to video games’ getting better over time). Perhaps people are just much less (consciously) bored at home anymore, which leaves less time for ruminating on things they want to maximize.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So perhaps it’s less of a handcuffs situation, golden or otherwise, and more of a selection for people who have optimized and been optimized for staying the current course, and look, now, rather than go down this other dark road, you can watch Tiger King or play Red Dead Redemption 2, doesn’t that sound more fun?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I wrote in the other post, selection effects are indeed a substantial part of this. But I am confused why there aren’t more opportunistic idealists who work in tech for a few years and then self-fund a career in the arts or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/independent-research">independent research</a>.</p>
<p>Even among people who regularly play video games, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019/#:~:text=Video%20gamers%20spend%20an%20average,than%2012%20hours%20a%20week.">US average</a> is just 7.6 hours a week, which doesn’t seem incredibly disruptive to ambition. In contrast, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_consumption#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20an%20average%20U.S.,than%2077%20days%20per%20year">Wikipedia</a> has Americans watching TV 4 hours a day, equivalent to 28 hours a week. So maybe the problem is TV, video games, social media and every other distraction combined?</p>
<p>Even then, it’s not like we’re talking about dysfunctionally unemployed people. Google engineers are (presumably) doing some work, I’m asking why they don’t spend that time on work they care about instead.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">secretary problem</a> is a useful framing, but has several key disanalogies. Unlike real life, the problem assumes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decisions are totally irrevocable (you can never pursue an opportunity you turned down earlier in life)</li>
<li>You’re maximizing the probability of selecting the single best opportunity, rather than expected value</li>
<li>The judgement and decision happens instantaneously, with no cost of “wasted years” on evaluation</li>
<li>You have no sense of absolute rankings, and can only compare opportunities relative to each other. In other words, if a mind blowing good opportunity presents itself tomorrow, the most you could say is “this is the best I’ve seen so far”. In real life, you at least have some useful priors over how good an opportunity is in absolute terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not sure how this changes the optimal stopping point, but that might be a good topic for another post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m a FAANG engineer, although since I work in a European office I probably make 50% less than your typical SV FAANG-adjacent engineer.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for a little over half a decade. So why don’t I, or most of the other folks around me, quit and follow our passions like you suggest?</p>
<p>Well some of us do quit to follow our passions. I know a handful of people who quit to join startups. I’ve heard anecdotes of a few other people moving back to their hometowns and taking on lower paid, less stressful remote work. While I don’t have startup ambitions as of now, I do plan to take a year off, explore the world the bit, learn scuba diving, etc.</p>
<p>But 90% of people end up staying at their jobs, year after year. I suspect there are a couple of factors making them do this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Lifestyle inflation. I think you touch on this in your post, but consider things like expensive cars, expensive houses (most tech offices are in high cost of living areas), sending kids to prep schools, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Social validation. People get attached to the social environment at work and see themselves defined by it. It’s scary to move onto something else. There’s also some social status associated with being a FAANG employee. You’re also competing with the Joneses now; your colleagues at work and other FAANG types around you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think 2 is probably a big factor for a lot of folks, probably a little for me as well, although I’m naive enough to think that I’m above such things :) I suspect it’s the same reason traders keep trading even after they’ve made millions.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the sabbatical goes. If I’m lucky I’ll be brave enough to cast off the golden handcuffs, at least for a year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Competing with the Joneses is compelling to me. If you start working at Google out of college, you’re on the lowest rung of the corporate ladder. It’s easy to say “I’ll quit once I get promoted and really prove myself, if I quit now it’ll just look like I couldn’t cut it.” But of course, once you get promoted your reference class shifts, and it’s now other senior engineers or engineering managers you have to prove yourself against.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymous (excerpt)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m convinced that the only thing that really motivates 80% of people to change is pain. If you’re working at Google, between the perks and the salary, you have no pain financially speaking. It’s pretty rare IMO for someone to make the jump from being motivated by pain to being self motivated by their goals. Google gives you a little bit of prestige, a lot of money, probably good coworkers, a path for advancement, and a minor feeling of achievement. It’s like being stuck at a local maximum and not noticing it’s not the global maximum.</p>
<p>Another reason may be that people are averse to open ended tasks. I would guess that the proportion of people is much less than 80%, although a sizable minority. For them Google would be the global maximum.</p>

<p>11th November 2017</p>
<p>This article describes how to program the ATtiny10, Microchip's diminuitive 6-pin processor, using the Arduino IDE. It's a great chip for building small gadgets and wearables, or designing interface logic for other projects, and it really lives up to its "tiny" name:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10.jpg" alt="ATtiny10.jpg" width="250" height="300"></p>
<p>The following sections explain how to program the ATtiny10 in C, and how to download programs using a low-cost ISP programmer. It also illustrates some simple applications with example programs.</p>
<p>For a couple of projects based on the ATtiny10 see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?201J">ATtiny10 POV Pendant</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2G8A">ATtiny10 Thermometer</a>.</p>
<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>
<p>If, like me, you like using the simplest possible chip for each application, the ATtiny10 will appeal to you&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>; it's a 6-pin processor, about the same size as an 0805 SMD resistor, and it costs about 35p/35¢. It packs in the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal 8MHz clock, by default prescaled to 1MHz.</li>
<li>Three I/O lines.</li>
<li>Two 16-bit PWM analogue outputs.</li>
<li>Three 8-bit analogue inputs.</li>
<li>An analogue comparator.</li>
<li>A 16-bit timer with input capture and an event counter.</li>
<li>A watchdog timer.</li>
<li>1024 bytes of program memory, 32 bytes of RAM, and no EEPROM.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these features will be familiar to users of the larger AVR chips. Here's the pinout (using Spence Konde's design conventions):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10pinout.gif" alt="ATtiny10Pinout.gif" width="701" height="159"></p>
<p>The internal oscillator is accurate to within 10%, but you can calibrate it in software to within 1%. You can configure RESET as a fourth I/O line, which prevents further programming, but I don't cover that in this article.</p>
<p>To work with the ATtiny10 on a breadboard you can mount it on a SOT23 breakout board, such as the one available from Sparkfun <sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>Programming the ATtiny10</h3>
<p>Unlike the SPI protocol used to program the larger AVR chips, such as the ATmega328 in the Arduino Uno, the ATtiny10 uses a programming protocol called TPI (Tiny Programming Interface) which needs only five wires. Fortunately Thomas Fischl's excellent USBasp programmer supports this protocol&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>; you can build your own, order one from his site, or they are widely available on eBay&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>, Banggood&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>, etc. I recommend getting one with a 10-pin to 6-pin adapter for ISP programming. The current versions of the Arduino IDE support the ATtiny10, so you can program it in C and upload programs as easily as with the other AVR chips. Since an Arduino core would use up almost half of the available program memory the best way to program it is to access the registers directly, and I give an overview of how to do this in the section&nbsp;<a href="#Alternatives">Alternatives to core functions</a>&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>Here are step-by-step instructions for programming the ATtiny10.</p>
<p>NOTE: There is a problem with compiling for the ATtiny10 with versions of the Arduino IDE 1.8.9 and higher. If necessary, run version 1.8.8 to do this, or for a workaround see the Disqus comments below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>ATtiny10Core</strong> hardware configuration from my repository on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/technoblogy/attiny10core" target="_blank">ATtiny10Core</a>.</li>
<li>Copy it to the&nbsp;<strong>hardware</strong>&nbsp;folder in your&nbsp;<strong>Arduino</strong>&nbsp;folder in your <strong>Documents</strong> folder. If there isn't already a <strong>hardware</strong> folder there, create one first.</li>
<li>Restart the Arduino IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should add an&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny10Core</strong>&nbsp;heading to the <strong>Board</strong> menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter your program into the Arduino IDE editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, try the&nbsp;<strong>Blink</strong>&nbsp;example program given below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the USBasp to the ATtiny10 as shown in the following diagram:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10usbasp.gif" alt="ATtiny10USBasp.gif" width="203" height="157"></p>
<p><em>Connecting the USBasp programmer to an ATtiny10.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;menu, and select the&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny10/9/5/4</strong>&nbsp;option under the <strong>ATtiny10Core</strong> heading; it's the only option.</li>
<li>Choose the chip you want from the <strong>Chip</strong> menu; for example&nbsp;<strong>ATtiny10</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>USBasp</strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>Programmer&nbsp;</strong>option on the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;menu.</li>
<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Upload</strong>&nbsp;to upload the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>The LED should blink at 0.5Hz.</p>
<p>Here's my test setup on a mini breadboard:</p>

<p><em>Testing the ATtiny10 Blink program on a mini breadboard, using the USBasp programmer.</em></p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Here are a couple of examples using the ATtiny10:</p>
<h4>Blink</h4>
<p>This is the ubiquitous Blink program:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

int main (void) {
  DDRB = 1;                       // PB0 as an output
  TCCR0A = 1&lt;&lt;COM0A0 | 0&lt;&lt;WGM00;  // Toggle OC0A, CTC mode
  TCCR0B = 1&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 3&lt;&lt;CS00;    // CTC mode; use OCR0A; /64
  OCR0A = 15624;                  // 1 second; ie 0.5Hz
  while (1);
}</pre>
<p>To run it connect an LED to PB0 as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10usbasp2.gif" alt="ATtiny10USBasp2.gif" width="157" height="128"></p>
<p><em>Circuit using an ATtiny10 to blink an LED.</em></p>
<p>It uses Timer/Counter0 to divide the 1MHz system clock by a prescaler value of 64, and then by 15625, toggling the output PB0 with a period of 1 second.</p>
<h4>Analogue frequency generator</h4>
<p>The following program reads the voltage from a potentiometer on analogue input ADC1 (PB1), and then uses this to set the compare match register OCR0A of Timer/Counter0, to generate a square wave on PB0 whose frequency you can control with the potentiometer:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

int main (void) {
  DDRB = 1;                       // PB0 as an output
  // Set up ADC on PB2
  ADMUX = 1&lt;&lt;MUX0;                // ADC1 (PB1)
  ADCSRA = 1&lt;&lt;ADEN | 3&lt;&lt;ADPS0;    // Enable ADC, 125kHz clock
  // Set up waveform on PB0
  TCCR0A = 1&lt;&lt;COM0A0 | 3&lt;&lt;WGM00;  // Toggle OC0A, Fast PWM
  TCCR0B = 3&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 4&lt;&lt;CS00;    // Fast PWM with OCR0A as TOP; /256
  // Main loop
  for (;;) {
    ADCSRA = ADCSRA | 1&lt;&lt;ADSC;    // Start
    while (ADCSRA &amp; 1&lt;&lt;ADSC);     // Wait while conversion in progress
    OCR0A = ADCL;                 // Copy result to frequency output
  }
}</pre>
<p>Note that because we're changing the compare match value, we need to use Fast PWM mode in this application, because it double-buffers the compare match value. Here's the circuit:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/attiny10usbasp3.gif" alt="ATtiny10USBasp3.gif" width="247" height="132"></p>
<p><em>Circuit using a potentiometer to adjust the frequency of a square wave generated by an ATtiny10.</em></p>
<p>It generates a frequency between 1MHz/256/256, or about 15Hz, and 1MHz/256/1, or 3.9kHz.</p>
<h3 id="Alternatives">Alternatives to core functions</h3>
<p>The following sections give some tips on programming the ATtiny10 to achieve some of the things provided by the Arduino core functions.</p>
<h4>includes</h4>
<p>You need to add these includes at the start of your program to include the AVR register definitions and standard C++ routines:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;</pre>
<h4>setup and loop</h4>
<p>Arduino programs are normally written with the initialization in&nbsp;<strong>setup()</strong>&nbsp;and the main program in&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong>, rather than the standard&nbsp;<strong>int&nbsp;main()</strong>&nbsp;function required by C. If you want to keep to this convention you'll need to add the following definition at the end of your program:</p>
<pre>int main() {
  setup();
  for(;;) loop();
}</pre>
<h4>pinMode</h4>
<p>To specify whether pins are inputs or outputs you set the corresponding bits in the <strong>DDRB</strong> register to 0 or 1 respectively. For example, to define pins 1 and 3 as outputs (and leave the other pins as inputs):</p>
<pre>DDRB = 0b0101; &nbsp; &nbsp;     // Equivalent to pinMode(1, OUTPUT); pinMode(3, OUTPUT);</pre>
<h4>Input pullups</h4>
<p>Unlike the older AVR chips, such as the ATmega328 and ATtiny85, the ATtiny10 enables pullup resistors using a separate pullup register, <strong>PUEB</strong>. To set pullups on input pins you set the corresponding bits in this&nbsp;register. For example, to set a pullup resistor on input pin 2:</p>
<pre>PUEB = 0b0010;         // Equivalent to pinMode(2, INPUT_PULLUP);</pre>
<p>Note that it doesn't make sense to set a pullup on an output.</p>
<h4>digitalWrite</h4>
<p>To set the state of an output you set the corresponding bits in the <strong>PORTB</strong> register. For example, to set bit 1 low and bit 3 high (assuming they have been defined as outputs):</p>
<pre>PORTB = 0b0100;        // Equivalent to&nbsp;digitalWrite(1, LOW);&nbsp;digitalWrite(3, HIGH);</pre>
<p>Changing the state of&nbsp;an input has no effect.</p>
<h4>digitalRead</h4>
<p>To read the state of the I/O pins you read the <strong>PINB</strong> register:</p>
<pre>int temp = PINB;</pre>
<h4>analogWrite</h4>
<p>You can use OC0A (PB0) and OC0B (PB1) for analogue output using PWM. You first need to configure the Timer/Counter into PWM mode for that pin; for example, using PB0:</p>
<pre>TCCR0A = 2&lt;&lt;COM0A0 | 3&lt;&lt;WGM00; // 10-bit PWM on OC0A (PB0), non-inverting mode
TCCR0B = 0&lt;&lt;WGM02 | 1&lt;&lt;CS00;   // Divide clock by 1
DDRB = 0b0001;                 // Make PB0 an output</pre>
<p>To write an analogue value we then need to write the value to the appropriate output compare register, OCR0A:</p>
<pre>OCR0A = 1000;                  // Equivalent to analogWrite(0, 1000)</pre>
<p>With a 5V supply this will set PB0 to 1000/1024 * 5V, or 4.88V.</p>
<h4>analogRead</h4>
<p>To use an I/O pin for analogue input you first need to configure the Analogue-to-Digital Converter. For example, to use ADC0:</p>
<pre>ADMUX = 0&lt;&lt;MUX0;               // ADC0 (PB0)
ADCSRA = 1&lt;&lt;ADEN | 3&lt;&lt;ADPS0;   // Enable ADC, 125kHz clock</pre>
<p>To read an analogue value from the pin we then need to start a conversion, and when the conversion is ready read the ADC register:</p>
<pre>ADCSRA = ADCSRA | 1&lt;&lt;ADSC;     // Start
while (ADCSRA &amp; 1&lt;&lt;ADSC);      // Wait while conversion in progress
int temp = ADCL;               // Copy result to temp
</pre>
<h4>delay</h4>
<p>For a simple substitute for&nbsp;<strong>delay()</strong>&nbsp;you can use a loop adjusted to give roughly the right timing:</p>
<pre>void delay (int millis) {
  for (volatile unsigned int i = 34*millis; i&gt;0; i--);
}</pre>
<p>This would provide an alternative way of writing the Blink program. Note that the counter variable&nbsp;<strong>i</strong>&nbsp;must be defined as&nbsp;<strong>volatile</strong>&nbsp;or the compiler will optimise it out of the loop, eliminating the delay.</p>
<p>For more accurate delays, and to implement timers like&nbsp;<strong>millis()</strong>, you could set up Timer/Counter0 as a timer, or use the Watchdog Timer.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>30th December 2019: Added a note about problems compiling for the ATtiny10 with versions of the Arduino IDE 1.8.9 or later. Use 1.8 to 1.8.8.</p><hr>

<p><strong>I.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>People who are decently well-off usually don’t appreciate how thin the line between “organized crime” and “local government” can be for the very poor.</p>



<p>In the Great Depression, notorious mobster <a href="https://www.history.com/news/al-capone-great-depression-soup-kitchen">Al Capone organized soup kitchens</a> in Chicago. More recently, Brazilian gangs, in response to government failure to take action against the pandemic, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewCesare/status/1242174265547468803">declared a unilateral quarantine order in Rio de Janeiro</a>, saying “If the government won’t do the right thing, organized crime will”. In some parts of Japan, the yakuza really are the <em>de facto</em> local government, and in the wake of natural disasters like earthquakes, they’re <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yakuza/yakuza-among-first-with-relief-supplies-in-japan-idUSTRE72O6TF20110325">often faster to provide aid than the Japanese government is</a>.</p>



<p>When you’re poor, the sad truth is that the <em>de jure</em> government probably doesn’t care about you much. There probably aren’t a lot of legitimate jobs in your area; you can’t afford to move away; even if you’re very talented, someone with better connections or a fancier-sounding degree will probably beat you out when competing for the few good jobs available.</p>



<p>This is especially true for marginalized groups, in particular when they’re targeted by law enforcement. In a legal system like ours, there are so many pointless and mutually contradictory laws that everyone is guilty of something. If the police watch you for long enough, they will eventually find something that they can arrest you for. (Obviously it’s even worse if they’re willing to lie or plant evidence, but the point is that it can happen even without this.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if they only put you away for a few weeks, a criminal record will probably kill your chances of getting a legitimate job in the future. If you want to serve your community, or even just put food on the table, your only choice may be an illegal job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But “criminal” doesn’t mean “evil”. Modern governments criminalize lots of things they really shouldn’t. If I couldn’t get a legal job, I would be pretty happy selling weed. I don’t think weed should be illegal, and there would be plenty of satisfied customers, so I would be open to sticking my thumb in the government’s eye over this issue if I didn’t have any other option. A similar argument can be made for other drugs, prescription medications, etc. — even giving medical care without a license. If none of these work for you, then remember that during prohibition, the government criminalized alcohol. Ask yourself how guilty you would feel selling booze in the 1920’s, if you had no other job prospects.</p>



<p>Since criminal activity is often the only way for the very poor to make their way in the world, criminal organizations are often the only local institutions around. And because the official government doesn’t really care about these neighborhoods (they may even be actively antagonistic), criminal organizations often end up being the only thing protecting the poor.</p>



<p>The affluent have a hard time understanding all of this, and for many people, a reasoned argument can’t shake the scary image of the criminal or gang member as an uncultured, unreasoning thug. </p>



<p>The good news is that this is what art is for. Fiction can give us, even if only distantly, the sense of what life is like for people who are different from us.</p>







<p><strong>II.</strong></p>



<p>So let’s imagine what a movie to flip this script would look like. Our hero is a young black man who grew up in a poor but respectable suburb of a major American city. He’s talented, but there aren’t many opportunities in his hometown. Like many young men with few options, he joins the Army. He’s quickly recognized as a crack shot and natural leader, gets recruited to the Green Berets, and receives multiple commendations. He also makes some very close friends. Once he returns to civilian life, one of his best friends from the Army runs for mayor, wins, and the protagonist spends the next few years helping his friend try to make things better in their city. He makes some money, starts dating a woman from a well-respected family, and begins thinking of settling down.</p>



<p>But when war is declared in the Middle East, his friend the mayor returns to military service to serve his country, and our hero joins him. They’re shipped overseas, and see a few years of intense combat. His friend the mayor goes missing in battle, presumed captured; our hero is injured and, after recuperating, is honorably discharged from service.</p>



<p>He’s sent home, only to find that things are worse than ever. The new mayor neglects social services in favor of pursuing a “tough on crime” agenda popular with the middle class. The police are encouraged to make lots of high-profile arrests, and they <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ney3em/police-can-take-your-stuff-for-no-reason-and-the-practice-is-on-the-rise">quickly grow fat on civil forfeiture</a>. Constant harassment by the police leads anyone with the means to try to leave the poor parts of town. As money flows out of the neighborhood, so do most businesses, taking with them the last few legitimate jobs.</p>



<p>Soon, almost no one can make a living without turning to some kind of crime. Often this is only opening a hairdresser’s without a license, or running a restaurant in your living room, but the cops crack down on these businesses just the same — and legally, they’re in the right.</p>



<p>The first thing our hero sees when he gets home is the police arresting a kid who tried to steal food from a gas station. He steps in to try to help, but the cops pull their guns on him. With his Special Forces training, he’s able to disarm the cops, free the kid, and make his escape, all without hurting anyone. What he doesn’t know is that he’s made a powerful enemy. One of the cops he embarrassed was the new sheriff, a close ally of the corrupt mayor, who recognizes him. The sheriff puts out an APB, and soon our hero finds that cops are crawling all over the city looking for him, and no one will take him in.</p>



<p>He eventually finds shelter with a preacher at a local church, who has seen enough of police brutality. He had shut down the church and begun to turn to drinking, but seeing someone stand up to the cops and get away with it has given him new hope for the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not just the preacher who takes note. Our hero starts attracting followers. First it’s his young cousin, a flashy dresser and accomplished boxer, hot-headed but idealistic. Next it’s a real beast of a man, a former bouncer who’s out of work and goes by “Lil’ Jon” or something, who impresses our hero by first beating him in a fight, and then throwing him off a bridge and into the river. Soon, more than a dozen people are hanging out in the basement of the abandoned church.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our hero can’t get legal work — in the eyes of the law, he’s a wanted criminal, who assisted the escape of a thief, resisted arrest, and assaulted officers. For one reason or another, neither can any of his followers. Even if he turned himself in, now that he knows he personally embarrassed the sheriff, he’s not confident he would survive to make it to trial.</p>



<p>But just because he can’t get legal work doesn’t mean he can’t make a difference for his community. The cops have been stealing property, cars, even cash from anyone they want, so he decides to steal it back. Under cover of night, the new band of friends break into the impound lot and take as many cars as they can drive away, leaving the guards hogtied but otherwise unharmed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this success under their belt, the group grows bolder. They find the location of a multi-millionaire CEO’s summer home up in the hills, break in, and take everything of value. Next they knock over an armored car on its way to a bank, taking everything and even recruiting the driver to join their cause. With so much money on hand, the preacher helps them launder it, distributing the money to those in need and making it appear to come from the church.</p>



<p>Their fame, or maybe infamy, grows. When the cops try to arrest people on trumped-up charges, our hero intervenes, and many of the people he saves (now considered criminals, whether they like it or not) decide to join him. His fiancée escapes from her controlling parents and finds him hiding in the urban jungle. When bounty hunters are sent to track him down, more often than not, they end up being convinced by his cause and joining him instead. Even some of the cops on the force throw away their badges and turn outlaw. The sheriff and the mayor stop calling him a “violent wanted criminal” and start calling him a “notorious gang leader”.</p>



<p>The rest of the movie is dedicated to all of the tricks they pull. They place a call on an anonymous tip line, “revealing” that the gang headquarters is in an abandoned mall. Half of the cop cars in the city converge on the mall, leaving the gang to heist a shipment of insulin, which they distribute for free to the needy. Our hero disguises himself and poses as a bounty hunter, joining the hunt for his own gang. He crashes a fundraiser at the mayor’s house and tells the rich what he really thinks of them. He gets captured and the rest of the gang has to break him out of jail. Eventually, his friend the mayor is released in a prisoner-of-war exchange, comes back, wins election once again, and pardons them all. The wicked mayor and the sheriff are exposed for their crimes and held accountable, and our hero finally marries his sweetheart. And of course, you’d call it <em>Hood Robin</em>.</p>



<p>(This idea <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_and_the_7_Hoods">isn’t even quite as out there as it sounds</a>.)</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/what-is-ebpf-header.png" width="100%" alt="what is ebpf"></p>

<p>About a year ago, a friend of mine decided to build an <a href="https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e">EVM</a> (Ethereum Virtual Machine) assembler in Rust. After some prodding from him, I began to help by writing unit tests. At the time, I knew very little about operating systems and started to read about lexical and symbolical analyzers. I was quickly in way over my head. What I did retain, however, was a newfound appreciation for the OS as a whole. So, when he started raving about eBPF, I knew I was in for a treat.</p>

<p>The bar for understanding what eBPF is and what it can do is high. Finding a good foothold to start was difficult for me. On the spectrum of basic 500-word mini-blogs to <a href="https://cilium.io/">Cilium’s</a> overwhelming documentation, material certainly skews towards documentation. My goal here is to provide a thorough entrypoint into this nascent technology, preparing you for progressively technical deep dives, like <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">Linux Weekly News</a>, <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/index.html">Brendan Gregg’s</a> website, and Cilium’s <a href="https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/bpf/">documentation</a>. Together, we will explore:</p>

<ul>
<li>What eBPF does</li>
<li>How eBPF works</li>
<li>An example of eBPF in use</li>
<li>How to start using eBPF</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-ebpf-do">What Does eBPF Do?</h2>

<p>eBPF lets programmers execute custom bytecode within the kernel <em>without</em> having to change the kernel or load kernel modules. Exciting? Maybe not yet. eBPF is closely intertwined with the Linux kernel. For context, let’s briefly review some fundamental concepts.</p>

<p>Linux divides its OS into two distinct areas: kernel space and user space. Kernel space is where the core of the operating system resides. It has full and unrestricted access to all hardware - memory, storage, CPU, etc. Due to the privileged nature of kernel access, the space is protected and allowed to run only the most trusted code. User space is where anything that is not a kernel process runs - I/O, file system manipulation, etc. These programs have limited access to hardware and must make syscalls through an API exposed by the kernel. In other words, user space programs must be filtered through the kernel space.</p>

<p>While the system call interface was sufficient in most cases, developers need more flexibility to add support for new hardware, filesystems, network protocols, or even custom system calls. There had to be a way for custom programs to access hardware directly, a way to extend the base kernel without adding directly to the kernel source code. <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/lkmpg.html">Linux Kernel Modules</a> (LKMs) serve this function. Unlike system calls, whereby requests traverse from the user space to kernel space, LKMs are loaded directly into the kernel, making them a part of it. Perhaps the most valuable feature of LKMs is that it can be loaded at runtime, removing the need to recompile the entire kernel and reboot the machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/what-is-ebpf-1.png" width="60%" alt="LKMs in kernel space"></p>

<p>Figure 1 - LKMs can be dynamically loaded and unloaded as part of kernel space (<a href="http://derekmolloy.ie/writing-a-linux-kernel-module-part-1-introduction/">Source</a>)</p>

<p>As helpful as LKMs are, they do introduce a lot of risk to the system. The division of kernel and user spaces added a number of security measures to the OS. The kernel space is meant to run only a privileged OS kernel. The layer between, connected by the system call interface, separated user space programs that could mess with finely tuned hardware. In other words, LKMs could certainly crash the kernel. Aside from the wide blast radius of security vulnerabilities, modules incur a large overhead maintenance cost in that kernel version upgrades could break the module.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-ebpf">What is eBPF</h4>

<p>eBPF programs are a more recent invention for accessing services and hardware from the Linux kernel space. Already these programs have been used for networking, debugging, tracing, firewalls, and more.</p>

<p>Born out of a need for better Linux tracing tools, eBPF drew inspiration from <code>dtrace</code>, a dynamic tracing tool available primarily for Solaris and BSD operating systems. Unlike <code>dtrace</code>, Linux could not get a global overview of running systems, it was limited to specific frameworks for system calls, library calls, and functions. Building on the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), a tool for writing packer-filtering code using an in-kernel VM, a small group of engineers began to extend the BPF backend to provide a similar set of features as <code>dtrace</code>. First released in limited capacity in 2014 with Linux 3.18, making full use of eBPF requires at least Linux 4.4 or above.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/what-is-ebpf-2.png" width="100%" alt="simplified visualization of eBPF architecture"></p>

<p>Figure 2</p>

<p>In Figure 2, we see a simplified visualization of eBPF architecture. Before being loaded into the kernel, the eBPF program must pass a certain set of requirements. Verification involves executing the eBPF program within the virtual machine. Doing so allows the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/bpf/verifier.c">verifier</a>, with 10,000+ lines of code, to perform a series of checks. The verifier will traverse the potential paths the eBPF program may take when executed in the kernel, making sure the program does indeed run to completion without any looping that would cause a kernel lockup. Other checks, from valid register state, program size, to out of bound jumps, must also be met. Almost immediately, eBPF sets itself apart from LKMs with important safety controls in place.</p>

<p>If all checks are passed, the eBPFprogram is loaded and compiled into the kernel at a point in a code path and listens for the right signal. That signal comes in the form of an event that passes where the program is loaded in the code path. Once triggered, the bytecode executes and collects information as per its instructions.</p>

<p>So what does eBPF do? It lets programmers safely execute custom bytecode within the Linux kernel without modifying or adding to kernel source code. While still a far cry from replacing LKMs as a whole, eBPF programs introduce custom code to interact with protected hardware resources with minimal threat to the kernel.</p>

<h2 id="how-ebpf-works">How eBPF Works</h2>

<p>So far, I’ve reduced eBPF to its bare architecture. But, there are more components working together, each of which has layers of complexity of their own.</p>

<h3 id="anatomy-of-an-ebpf-program">Anatomy of an eBPF Program</h3>

<h4 id="events-and-hooking">Events and Hooking</h4>

<p>eBPF programs are triggered by events that pass a particular location in the kernel. These events are captured at hooks when a specific set of instructions are executed in a single run. When triggered, these hooks will execute an eBPF program, letting us capture or manipulate data. The diversity of hook locations is one of the many aspects that makes eBPF so useful. A quick sampling of these locations include:</p>

<ul>
<li>System Calls - Inserted when user space functions transfer execution to the kernel</li>
<li>Function Entry and Exit - Intercepts calls to pre-existing functions</li>
<li>Network Events - Executes when packets are received</li>
<li>Kprobes and uprobes - Attach to probes for kernel or user functions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="helper-calls">Helper Calls</h4>

<p>When eBPF programs are triggered at their hook points, they make calls to helper functions. These special functions are what makes eBPF feature-rich in accessing memory. For example, helpers can perform a wide variety of tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Search, update, and delete key-value pairs in tables</li>
<li>Generate a pseudo-random number</li>
<li>Collect and flag tunnel metadata</li>
<li>Chain eBPF programs together, known as tail calls</li>
<li>Perform tasks with sockets, like binding, retrieve cookies, redirect packets, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These helper functions must be defined by the kernel, meaning there is a whitelist of calls eBPF programs can make. But the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html">number</a> is large and continues to grow.</p>

<h4 id="maps">Maps</h4>

<p>To store and share data between the program and kernel or user spaces, eBPF makes use of maps. As implied by the name, maps are key-value pairs. Supporting a number of different data structures, like hash tables, arrays, and tries, programs are able to send and receive data in maps using helper functions.</p>

<h3 id="executing-an-ebpf-program">Executing an eBPF Program</h3>

<h4 id="loading-and-verifying">Loading and Verifying</h4>

<p>The kernel expects all eBPF programs to be loaded as bytecode, so unless bytecode is being written, we need a way to compile higher level languages. To build out this compiler, eBPF uses <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> as its back-end infrastructure on which a front-end for any programming language can be built. Because eBPF programs are written in C, that language front end is <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>. But before compiled bytecode can be hooked anywhere, it must pass a series of checks. By simulating the program in a VM-like construct, an <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/kernel/bpf/verifier.c">in-kernel verifier</a> can prevent programs that loop, do not have the right permissions, or crash the kernel. If the program passes all checks, program bytecode will be loaded onto the hook point using a <code>bpf()</code> system call</p>

<h4 id="just-in-time-jit-compiler">Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler</h4>

<p>After verification, eBPF bytecode is JIT’d into native machine code. eBPF has a modern design, meaning it has been upgraded to be 64-bit encoded with 11 total registers. This closely maps eBPF to hardware for x86_64, ARM, and arm64 architecture, amongst others. Fast compilation at runtime makes it possible for eBPF to remain performant even as it must first pass through a VM.</p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2020/what-is-ebpf-3.png" width="100%" alt="eBPF architecture"></p>

<p>eBPF Architecture (<a href="https://lucid.app/invitations/accept/0096e31e-14f9-47d4-a1a0-57e82b3bc6f5">Raw LucidChart</a>)</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Putting this conceptual jigsaw together, eBPF programs are inserted into a hook point after passing a number of safety checks. When they are triggered by an event, programs execute immediately, using a combination of helper functions and maps to manipulate and store data. We’ll take a closer look at how these components work together in the next section</p>

<h2 id="example-ebpf-in-action">Example: eBPF in Action</h2>

<p>At Teleport, we’ve used a few eBPF programs in one of our open source projects, Teleport, for tracing and networking. For some necessary context: <a href="https://goteleport.com/teleport">Teleport</a> gives developers secure server access via SSH. Because organizations want to know what happens during a session, Teleport records user actions. Yet there are ways to bypass session recording entirely by obfuscating behavior within encoded commands, commands run in shell scripts, or even terminal commands like disabling <code>echo</code>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year with our <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/teleport-release-4-2">Teleport 4.2 release</a>, we introduced <em>enhanced</em> session recording, which uses three eBPF programs (for now!) to take unstructured SSH sessions and transform them into a stream of structured events.</p>

<p>Consider <code>echo Y3VybCBodHRwOi8vd3d3LmV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg== | base64 --decode | sh</code>. Though we can capture this command printed in the terminal, it means nothing to us as the …</p></article></div>

        <p>This is it ! Cyca v1.0 Revoluta, the first stable version of your new bookmarks
and feeds manager is now available !</p>
<p><img src="https://www.getcyca.com/images/covers/cyca-1.0-cover.png#center" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m not sure how to announce the first stable version of an application, but it
seems important to me to use this opportunity to remind Cyca’s features and
objectives.</p>
<h2 id="brief-description">Brief description</h2>
<p>Cyca is a Free and Open Source Software released under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> in its most recent version.</p>
<p>It is a web-based, desktop-centric, multi-users application written in PHP.</p>
<p>It allows you to manage an unlimited number of bookmarks and feeds in a folders
hierarchy (as opposed to tag-based taxonomy), and share them through users
groups.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>A <em>Group</em> represents a set of users sharing the same interest. For instance,
<em>Computing</em>. Each group has its own hierarchy of <em>Folders</em>. Each user can join
any number of groups.</p>
<p>A <em>Folder</em> is a way to organize <em>Documents</em> in a <em>Group</em>. A folder can only
belong to one group, but can have any number of <em>Bookmarks</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>Document</em> is the resource located at a specific URL and is not a <em>Feed</em> or a
<em>Feed item</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>Feed</em> is always linked to a <em>Document</em>. Currently, RSS and Atom feeds are
supported.</p>
<p>A <em>Feed item</em> can be linked to one or more <em>Feeds</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>Bookmark</em> is a link between a folder and a document.</p>
<p>A <em>Feed item state</em> is the link between a feed item and a user, and holds the
feed item state for that user (read/unread).</p>
<p>A <em>Highlight</em> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>
associated to a color, enabling highlighting in feed item title.</p>
<h2 id="main-features">Main features</h2>
<h3 id="groups">Groups</h3>
<p>Any user can create or join an existing group.</p>
<p>Each user is assigned to its own group which cannot be deleted. By default, this
group is not accessible to other users in any way.</p>
<p>Each user-created group, including its own group, could be shared, either
through email invitation (group owner sends an email invitation to other users)
or by making it publicly available (so other users can join it anytime they
want).</p>
<p>When a user is invited to join a group, he can accept or decline.</p>
<p>Owners of a public group can decide if users asking to join it can do it freely
or if it needs manual approbation.</p>
<p>It is possible to search for groups to join.</p>
<p>Public groups are currently scoped to the server where Cyca is installed, but in
a future upgrade, it would be possible to join groups from remote servers.</p>
<h3 id="folders">Folders</h3>
<p>You can create an unlimited number of folders as a deeply nested hierarchy,
pretty much like on any operating system. A lot of similar applications have
chosen limited tag-based organization.</p>
<p>There are currently two special kinds of folders in Cyca:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Unread feed items” folder</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking on it will display a list of documents containing unread feed items for
connected user, and the list of unread feed items.</p>
<p>It cannot be renamed or altered in any way. Its icon color changes should
current user have unread items or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Root” folder</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the top-level folder. No user-created folder can be a sibling, but it can
hold an unlimited number of sub-folders and bookmarks.</p>
<p>It cannot be renamed or altered in any way except users permissions when it
belongs to a shared group.</p>
<p>Drag and drop is supported for any user-created folder.</p>
<p>Folders can be expanded or collapsed. Long-clicking caret on the left-side of
a folder will toggle every other folder in the branch.</p>
<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>
<p>Documents are added to any folder (except the <em>Unread items</em> folder) by entering
a URL.</p>
<p>You can drag and drop documents from/to any folder except <em>Unread items</em>.</p>
<p>Cyca will automatically detect feeds declared in the document, and by testing
some hard-coded, well-known URLs relative to document’s URL (for instance,
<em>/feed</em>).</p>
<h3 id="feeds">Feeds</h3>
<p>Feeds are always handled automatically by Cyca. If you create a document in a
folder using a URL where Cyca finds a feed, it will search for feed’s home page,
“convert” the document to a feed, and update your bookmark accordingly.</p>
<p>By default, Cyca will consider you will follow every discovered feed. You could
then ignore individual feeds.</p>
<p>Cyca automatically handles feed items de-dupplication.</p>
<h3 id="feed-items">Feed items</h3>
<p>Feed items can be <em>read</em> or <em>unread</em>. You can mark individual unread feed item,
items in a specific document, or items in a specific folder as read, or mark
all unread feed items as read from the <em>Unread feed items</em> folder.</p>
<p>After marking feed items as read, Cyca will do its best to automatically select
next unread item, should it be in the same or different feed, document or
folder.</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<p>You can define an unlimited number of <em>Highlights</em>, which consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A regular expression</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be a full-blown, complex regular expression or simple text.</p>
<ul>
<li>A color</li>
</ul>
<p>When a list of feed items is about to be displayed, Cyca will try to find
matches for each of your highlights in feed item’s title. If a match is found,
it will be highlighted using chosen color.</p>
<h3 id="importexport">Import/export</h3>
<p>Currently, Cyca only supports importing and exporting to and from Cyca’s format,
which is a simple JSON object. Future updates will include more formats, the
more obvious being OPML and Netscape bookmarks file format.</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<p>Cyca is an opiniated application. I brought to it my own vision of how bookmarks
and feeds should be managed. Besides, bookmarks and feeds are inherently highly
tighted: a bookmark points to a document you like, which could itself point to
highly valuable news feeds. If you have bookmarks in your browser or current
bookmarks manager, there is a high chance you’d like to know if there is
anything new about it without having to visit it from time to time “manually”.</p>
<p>So I wanted to build an application that allows me to easily browse in a large
collection of bookmarks, and provides me news updates as well, without being
obtrusive. I don’t want notification popups or changing, colorful and blinking
icons on my desktop or browser’s title bar. I don’t want to be disturbed.
I want to check news whenever I want and not whenever my application wants.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>Cyca always was my “lab” for testing coding practices, new technologies, for as
long as I can remember. It started probably back in 2000, when I wanted to test
Microsoft’s C#, because the very first version of Cyca I’ve ever written was in
this language.</p>
<p>I’ve wrote a lot of different versions since then, and quickly after C# I moved
to PHP, because I thought a web-based application would be more suited to do
what Cyca does.</p>
<p>I never really wanted to make it public as Cyca was just a lab. I changed my
mind a lot about what I should/could do, it wouldn’t have been sustainable for
users. Users want - and they are right - stability, and a linear progression of
features. Over time, I added and removed a lot of things from Cyca.</p>
<p>Then, last year, I lost my job, and I couldn’t find one as soon as I wanted.
Well, maybe it was because I burnt-out too… Anyways, I decided to take a shot
and make Cyca public. So I created a new version from scratch, deemed to be
publicly released.</p>
<p>It took me a while because once again, I couldn’t decide what to include and
what not to. After six months of intensive work, I… decided to start from
scratch again ! The result was slow and had way too much dependencies… And in
about two months, I finally released the
<a href="https://github.com/RichardDern/Cyca/releases/tag/0.1.0">v0.1</a>, on 17th,
September 2020.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-name">About the name</h3>
<p>Cyca was initially named “Bookmarks Manager”, but it was too generic, and didn’t
convoy the concept of “feeds”. By the time, my parents offered me a very young
tree, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycas">Cycas</a> to plant in our garden. I
loved that tree, its shapes and colors. And what it represents: an outsider,
between the trees and the palms.</p>
<p>I love the tree, and its use in computing, and as a concept as a whole. One idea
could imply many others, one folder could hold many documents. It’s a pretty
universal concept, that could be seen and used anywhere, from astronomy to
biology, from genealogy to mathematics.</p>
<p>So, my application being a tool to manage information in a hierarchy, in a tree,
I found <em>Cyca</em> spelled without the final “s” (to make it different from the
biological genus), to be a good name.</p>
<p>While each release in the v0.x branch had a generic name (like
<a href="https://www.getcyca.com/2020/11/18/v0-8-the-groups-update/"><em>The Groups Update</em></a> for instance), I
wanted major releases to have a codename based on Cycas species. And I wanted
the first one to be the tree I’ve received from my parents when I was young:
Revoluta.</p>
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>Every developer would tell you the same thing: a major release is not an end,
it’s a beginning. As such, I have a lot of plans for future updates.</p>
<p>I am not sure about the order in which I will release these features, or even if
I will actually bring them to life, as it depends on things I can’t control. I
am currently unemployed, and have no steady income. By the end of February, I
will be without any resource. Making a living from Cyca would obviously be my
best option, but I could also be forced to do something else. Should it be, I
probably couldn’t spend as much time as I would like on Cyca.</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding groups</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to expand groups so users from one instance of Cyca could join groups
from another, remote instances. That would work pretty much like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">Activity Pub</a>, in theory, but I
still need to figure how to make it happen. I believe it’s going to be pretty
hard work, but I also think it would absolutely worth it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetching more information</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s amazing to see how much information you can collect from a single URL. When
Cyca was just my “lab”, I have written versions that allowed to collect
<strong>a lot</strong> of data. I am not talking about sensitive, security related,
aggressively scraped information, which never was and never will be Cyca’s
intention. I am talking about publicly available data, such as WHOIS,
certificate expiration, web-server, etc. exposed into document’s meta-data or
server’s response. I want a future version of Cyca able to collect and present
these information to the user.</p>
<p>It would allow interesting uses of Cyca, such as archiving URLs, helping hosters
to keep a …</p></div></div>

            <td></td>
            <td>
            <p>1. Notable New Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Scalable TrueType font (TTF) output for DOS applications</p>With the new TrueType font (TTF) output, you will get nice high resolution DOS screen rendered using a TrueType font (either the built-in one or a TTF font of your choice), and the window can be set to almost any usable number of lines and columns. This feature greatly improved DOSBox-X's support for DOS applications. Set "output=ttf" (or from the "Video" menu) to enable this output.</li>

<li><p>On-screen text styles for DOS applications</p>With the TrueType font output, DOSBox-X now supports on-screen text styles for DOS applications including WordPerfect, WordStar, and XyWrite. With this feature you will visually see fonts in bold for bold text, and fonts in italics for italicized text, and so on. Set a DOS word processor (WP/WS/XY) to enable this feature.</li>

<li><p>Support for Apple M1 Mac and macOS Big Sur</p>DOSBox-X now supports the new Apple ARM-based M1 MacBooks! The dynamic core now works on the new ARM-based macOS systems. The audio also works once again when compiled and run on macOS 11 Big Sur.</li>

<li><p>Pasting clipboard text in macOS SDL1 builds</p>Pasting text from the host system clipboard is now supported in the macOS SDL1 build, similar to the Linux SDL1 build. On all other platforms (Windows SDL1/SDL2, Linux SDL2, and macOS SDL2) both copying to and pasting from the clipboard are supported.</li>

<li><p>System menu in Windows SDL2 builds</p>The system menu that was available in Windows SDL1 builds is now also
available for Windows SDL2 builds, which includes a few common menu options such as the configuration tool and the mapper editor.</li>

<li><p>Select common host keys from the menu</p>You can now select a host key from the "Main" menu, which now includes common key combinations such as Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, and Alt+Shift, or you may just use the mapper-defined host key (which default to F11 on Windows and F12
otherwise). The default shortcuts for a few items are changed to use the host key style.</li>

<li><p>Switch OpenGL (GLSL) shaders at run-time</p>With the OpenGL outputs (opengl/opengnb/openghq), you can now select and switch to a different GLSL shader at the run-time by selecting the menu item "Select OpenGL (GLSL) shader..." from the "Video" menu, similar to the function for Direct3D pixel shaders for the Direct3D output.</li>

<li><p>Display IDE disk or CD status</p>There is now a menu option under "DOS" menu which allows you to see the current assignments (disk or CD image) of the IDE controllers.</li>

<li><p>Support for mounting MAME CHD CD images</p>Mounting the MAME CHD images is now supported in DOSBox-X! You can mount CHD files as CD images with IMGMOUNT command, or from the "Drive" menu.</li>

<li><p>Support for saving your files for the save-state feature</p>There is a now a FLAGSAVE command which allows you to mark files to be saved and loaded by the save-state feature. Type "FLAGSAVE /?" at the DOSBox-X shell for more usage information.</li>

<li><p>Enhanced MODE command to change screen dimensions</p>You can now change the number of columns and lines on the screen with the
MODE command, similar to real DOS systems. Alternatively, this can be done from the "Video" menu (within "Text-mode" menu group).</li>

<li><p>Improved LOADFIX command to auto-allocate memory</p>The LOADFIX command now has an -a option which will automatically allocate enough memory to fill lowest 64KB memory instead of using exactly 64KB memory. This will let some memory-demanding DOS programs or games to run with this command.</li>

<li><p>Improved automatic fix for the "Packed file corrupt" error</p>The handler for the "Packed file corrupt" error has been greatly improved so that it will likely automatically handle the error more efficiently. There is now also an option to silence the messages during the automatic fix.</li>

</ul>

            <p>2. Notable Usability Improvements</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improved mapper editor interface</p>The mapper editor interface has been enhanced! The texts for the shortcut functions are now longer and clearer, and there are now multiple pages in the mapper, navigable with the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons.</li>

<li><p>Load DOSBox-X mapper files from menu</p>You can now select and load DOSBox-X mapper files at run-time from the "Main" menu. Previously it was possible to load a mapper file dynmically from the command line, but now you can do so from the menu too.</li>

<li><p>List network interfaces from menu</p>There is now a "List network interfaces" menu option under the "Help" menu that will list the current network interfaces for the NE2000 networking feature. Previously you can only see the network interface list from the log file.</li>

<li><p>Display DOS command help from menu</p>You can now find a "DOS commands" menu group under the "Help" menu, which allows you to select a DOS shell command (DIR, CD, etc) to see its help messages. Alternatively you can type "[COMMAND] /?" (e.g. "DIR /?") for help information for the command.</li>

<li><p>Searching for config file and mapper file in DOSBox-X executable path</p>DOSBox-X will now look for the config file (e.g.
dosbox-x.conf) and the mapper file in the directory containing the DOSBox-X executable too if they cannot be found in the DOSBox-X working directory. This makes DOSBox-X even more portable.</li>

<li><p>More saving options for the built-in configuration tool</p>The graphical configuration tool now provides the option to save
to the primary or user config files, not just the dosbox-x.conf file.</li>

<li><p>New config options for save state options</p>The config options "saveremark" and "forceloadstate" are added to [dosbox]
section which can be used to control the save state-related options from the config file. In the previous section these can only be done from the "Capture" menu.</li>

</ul>

            <p>3. Bugfixes and Other Improvements</p>
There are also many bugfixes and other improvements, such as fixing the CD audio issue with the game "The Secret of Monkey Island" when talking to the pirate in Scumm Bar. Please see the full changelogs below for more information.
<p>4. Full Changelog In This Version</p>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for scalable TrueType font (TTF)
output for text-mode programs. Set "output=ttf"
and optionally a monospaced TTF font (such as
consola) with config option "ttf.font" to use it.
Lines and columns can be specified with config
options "ttf.lins" and "ttf.cols", and the cursor
can be made blinking with the option "ttf.blinkc".
The config options "ttf.ptsize" and "ttf.winperc"
can be used to set the TTF font size and window
percentage respectively. If you specify a TTF font
size with "ttf.ptsize" then "ttf.winperc" will be
ignored. You can also specify a word processor
(WP=WordPerfect, WS=WordStar, XY=XyWrite) for the
on-screen text-style and 512-character font (WP)
features. When using the TTF output DOSBox-X will
temporarily switch to a different output when a
graphical mode is requested (or when trying to take
a screenshot); the TTF output will be auto-switched
back later), which can be customized via config
option "ttf.outputswitch" (which defaults to auto).
Menu items in the "Text-mode" menu group (under
"Video" menu) have been expanded to support TTF
options such as increasing/decreasing the TTF font
sizes and on-screen text style toggling (including
bold, italics, underline and strikeout). You can
also select a TTF font to use at run-time with the
"Select TrueType font (TTF)" menu option. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added the "Load mapper file..." menu option (under
"Main") to select and load a DOSBox-X mapper file
at run-time. Be sure to select a SDL1 mapper file
for SDL1 builds, and similar for SDL2. (Wengier)
</li><li>
You can now select a host key from the menu (under
"Main") including Ctrl+Alt, Ctrl+Shift, Alt+Shift,
or use the mapper-defined host key as in previous
versions (which default to F11 on Windows and F12
otherwise). A config option "hostkey" is added so
that you can specify it from config file. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Pasting text from the clipboard on macOS SDL1 build
is now supported like Linux SDL1 build. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added support for ARM-based Apple M1 MacBook. The
dynamic core now works on ARM-based macOS systems.
SDL1 builds updated to use newer audio APIs on the
macOS platform so that the audio works once again
when compiled and run on macOS 11 (Big Sur). Prior
to the change, ancient versions of the API dating
back to the mid 2000s were used which no longer
work on Big Sur.
</li><li>
DOSBox-X will now look for the config file (i.e.
dosbox-x.conf/dosbox.conf) and the mapper file in
the directory containing the DOSBox-X executable
too if the config or mapper file cannot be found
in the DOSBox-X working directory. (Wengier)
</li><li>
The system menu in Windows SDL1 builds is now also
available for Windows SDL2 builds, and menu items
"Reset font size", "Increase TTF font size" and
"Decrease TTF font size" are added. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Enhanced the mapper editor interface to allow more
keyboard shortcuts to be added, shown in multiple
pages in the mapper, navigable with the "Previous
Page" and "Next Page" buttons. The text in the
grids are now longer and clearer too. The default
shortcuts for a few items are changed to use the
Host key style (e.g. Host+S and Host+L for saving
and loading states respectively). (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added menu item "List network interfaces" under
"Help" menu to list network interfaces in the host
system for the NE2000 feature. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added menu group "DOS commands" under "Help" menu
to display the help content for the selected DOS
shell command (DIR, CD, etc). (Wengier)
</li><li>
Configuration Tool now provides the option to save
to the primary or user config files. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Certain config options (e.g. doublescan) that were
marked as advanced options are now general config
options and will appear in dosbox-x.reference.conf
apart from dosbox-x.reference.full.conf. (Wengier)
</li><li>
Added config options "saveremark" (default: true)
and "forceloadstate" (default: false) in [dosbox]
section which can be used to control if DOSBox-X
should ask users to enter remarks when saving a
state or show warnings when loading a saved state
if there is a mismatch found. (Wengier)
</li><li>
The config option "pixelshader" is moved from the
section [gui] to [render] …</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p>Mac users upgrading to Big Sur are affected by this bug, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/jt0gjk/big_sur_forgets_where_apps_windows_are_when/">user reports</a> about it have <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/651131?answerId=644269022">existed since July on Apple’s developer forums</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s a short video I made demoing the bug on Big Sur that ends with showing how things used to work on Catalina:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Demo of a bug where Big Sur forgets where app windows are when plugging back into external displays" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPt8yJmutQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Recap: If you unplug an external display and then plug it back in, none of your apps’ windows (which were on the external display’s Space beforehand) are visible or where they used to be. Usually for me, the external monitor’s Space appears completely empty.</p>



<p>As the video shows, my Big Sur install is the latest public version 11.0.1 and is not enrolled in a beta program.</p>



<h4>Here are what other users are saying (from the links provided above):</h4>



<blockquote><p>I have a similar issue also. It’s infuriating. My macbook is connected to an external 4k monitor, which is the main monitor. If I switch to a full screen app and stay there a while, then go back to the desktop, all open windows will be off screen, in the far right. I have to go to mission control, drag the windows to away from the external monitor and to the macbook desktop, and then move them back again to the main monitor. I hope they get a fix soon.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Is there a fix for this yet?<br>4 months later?? Really wish i didnt up grade.<br>Use 2 Benq monitors for editing through a wavlink hub.<br>working perfect, upgraded to Big Sur.. and now nothing</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Same. I regret upgrading.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I’m facing the same situation on both my work and home monitor set up. This is incredibly frustrating and I’ve told all of the members of my engineering group to not update to Big Sur until this is fixed.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>i had the same problem with my monitor external, plss apple help us</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I am having the same issue, wish I never updated this early. It seems like most people are having issues with HDMI, my display cord is a usb-c to usb-c and its still not working. It seems now the only solution is downgrading to catalina…</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>same issue. Extended monitors no longer work….. will think twice before updating so early.&nbsp; pls pls pls FIX</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Same here after updating to Big Sur. As soon as I connect the external monitor, all my apps are somewhere off-screen. I have to use Mission Control to drag my apps to the laptop screen to access them again. This is quite a nuisance.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Yeah, I’m having the same issue as others who are here in November 2020 (the day after the release). Definitely regretting updating entirely now because trying to teach all from one small monitor (when both me and my students are used to me having two monitors) is ruining my lessons. Is there any fix out there or any possibility of this being fixed before the weekend is over and classes resume on Monday? The is extremely frustrating because one would think this kind of issue would be caught in their “extensive” beta process.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I’m on the 11.0.1 public release and I just experienced this. I had multiple apps open on my external monitor. My macbook pro went to sleep, when I woke it back up, I coudln’t access the windows for those apps no matter what I did. I could see them if I used “expose” , but had literally no way to pull them back up on my external monitor. Ended up having to close all the apps and re-open them on my external monitor, only thing I could figure out to do.</p></blockquote>



<p>There are several more pages with comments like these ^.</p>



<p>This also breaks Current Key Stats for users of multiple displays, which is exceedingly frustrating.</p>



<p>I want Current Key Stats to get back in the App Store. I hope Apple fixes Big Sur soon. I started writing this blog post immediately after replying to three emails from people who wanted to download and use Current Key Stats but can’t. The app has thousands of current users who are going to be affected by this Big Sur bug when they upgrade if it isn’t fixed. To borrow from the last email I wrote on this “I can’t afford to have something on the store that will lead to a customer service support nightmare and frustrating experiences for users.”</p>



<p>I have been putting off writing this blog post, because I’d always prefer to be writing software instead. Speaking of which, I have an altogether-new project I’ve been working on, and you can sign up <a href="https://spencerdailey.substack.com/p/coming-soon">here</a> to get notified when it’s available.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This week I ran into an interesting bug in the unit tests for some
multithreaded code. The setup for the test involved a
“process status daemon” that (in production) polled some global state
once per second, and also provided some auxiliary functions that we
wanted to test. The “once per second” code came from an old and
widely-used internal helper library. In this retelling, I’ve taken
the liberty of updating it for C++20:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>class OncePerSecond {
    std::thread t_;
    std::binary_semaphore sem_{0};
    bool stopped_ = false;

    virtual void do_action() { }

public:
    explicit OncePerSecond() {
        t_ = std::thread([this]() {
            do {
                do_action();
            } while (!sem_.try_acquire_for(std::chrono::seconds(1)));
        });
    }
    void stop() {
        if (!std::exchange(stopped_, true)) {
            sem_.release();
            t_.join();
        }
    }
    virtual ~OncePerSecond() { stop(); }
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To use this <code>OncePerSecond</code> gadget, you derive from it and override
the <code>do_action</code> method to do whatever-it-is that you want to do.
For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int *production_state;

class StatusDaemon : public OncePerSecond {
    std::map&lt;int, int&gt; config_;
    void do_action() override {
        printf("The global state is %d\n", *production_state);
    }
public:
    int config_size() const { return config_.size(); }
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Creating an instance of <code>StatusDaemon</code> kicks off a background thread
that prints “The global state is…” every second.
(In production, of course, you’d initialize <code>production_state</code> to
point to something before you created your <code>StatusDaemon</code> object.)
Destroying the <code>StatusDaemon</code> object cleans up its thread.</p>

<h2 id="the-segfaulting-unit-test">The segfaulting unit test</h2>

<p>Now, one of the <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest#googletest">GTest</a>
unit tests for this component was segfaulting. So I took a look at it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>class NeuteredStatusDaemon : public StatusDaemon {
    void do_action() override { }
};

TEST(StatusDaemon, config_starts_empty) {
    NeuteredStatusDaemon sd;
    EXPECT_EQ(sd.config_size(), 0);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Maybe one in every 100 or 1000 times, this test segfaults!
Do you see the problem?</p>

<h2 id="the-diagnosis">The diagnosis</h2>

<p>The author of this unit test clearly knew that <code>StatusDaemon::do_action()</code> was
going to be problematic. That function depends on <code>production_state</code> to be
initialized to its production value, <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2018/06/17/piling-swivel/">which in our case we have not got</a>.
So the author added <code>NeuteredStatusDaemon</code>, which is just like <code>StatusDaemon</code> except
that its <code>do_action</code> is a no-op.</p>

<p>But gdb shows that the segfault is happening inside <code>StatusDaemon::do_action()</code>!
See, even though <code>StatusDaemon</code>’s <code>do_action</code> was overridden, there are still
a couple of points where that overridden virtual method is still callable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>During construction: while the object under construction is still constructing
  its <code>StatusDaemon</code> base, but before it’s begun constructing its
  <code>NeuteredStatusDaemon</code> parts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During destruction: after it’s already destroyed its <code>NeuteredStatusDaemon</code> parts,
  but before it’s begun destroying its <code>OncePerSecond</code> parts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Observe that <code>stop</code> is called only from the <code>OncePerSecond</code> destructor.
<em>This is a fatal flaw!</em> It means that the worker thread (the one who runs
<code>do_action</code>) is not told to stop until after most parts of the <code>NeuteredStatusDaemon</code>
have already been destroyed. So, the worker thread may in fact access the vptr
of <code>sd</code> during the brief window of time in which <code>sd</code> (dynamically speaking) is
no longer a <code>NeuteredStatusDaemon</code>, and is not yet a <code>OncePerSecond</code>, but is — very
briefly and fatally — a production <code>StatusDaemon</code>.</p>

<p>Sidebar: <code>OncePerSecond</code> implements <code>do_action</code> as a no-op,
so if the worker thread happens to call <code>do_action</code> during the relatively larger window
during which <code>sd</code> is (dynamically speaking) a <code>OncePerSecond</code> object, that’s not likely
to cause a problem in practice. But it is still a data race on the vptr, and therefore
still undefined behavior!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a method must be overridden in every derived class, make it pure virtual.
Don’t violate this guideline just to “fix a segfault”; understand the segfault first!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bug is easier to reproduce if we make <code>OncePerSecond::do_action</code> pure virtual.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>The solution to our crashing unit test is to make sure that <code>NeuteredStatusDaemon</code>
calls <code>stop</code> from its destructor, before starting to destroy its members and bases.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>class NeuteredStatusDaemon : public StatusDaemon {
    void do_action() override { }
    ~NeuteredStatusDaemon() override { stop(); }
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In fact, we must audit <em>every</em> class derived from <code>OncePerSecond</code> to make sure that
the most-derived class’s destructor calls <code>stop</code>. For example, even though our
production <code>StatusDaemon</code> generally works in practice, it still has undefined behavior
as far as C++ is concerned, because of the data race between <code>~StatusDaemon()</code>’s
write to the vptr and the worker thread’s read from the vptr. We should explicitly
define <code>~StatusDaemon()</code> to call <code>stop</code>, as well.</p>

<p>I have not figured out any clever pattern to enforce “you must always override X in the
most-derived class.” Honestly, I suspect that <code>OncePerSecond</code> is simply a bad fit
for classical inheritance.</p>

<h2 id="explain-the-title-please">Explain the title please</h2>

<p>The UB here is essentially a C++ version of the web-design phenomenon known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content">“Flash of Unstyled Text”</a> (FOUT).
In a FOUT, the browser might start rendering the text of a page (one might say the
“base functionality” of the page) before having loaded all the necessary JavaScript and
fonts and so on (one might say the “more derived” parts). This might result in a brief
window of time during which the base functionality is visible — producing potentially
surprising and unintended results for anyone who happens to glance at their screen right then.</p>

<p>Web pages usually care about such a “flash” happening during the web
equivalent of <em>construction</em>. The serious problem we observed with <code>NeuteredStatusDaemon</code>
surfaced during <em>destruction</em>.</p>

<p>UPDATE, 2020-12-10: Reddit commenter “goranlepuz” points out that our constructor also has UB:
the first call to <code>do_action</code> races with the construction of the <code>StatusDaemon</code>
parts of the object. This is partly because I oversimplified — our real code uses a
separate <code>start</code> method to kick off the thread — but to be honest, (1) I didn’t realize
that my rewrite was introducing that extra bug, and (2) it’s not obvious who should be
responsible for calling <code>start</code>! Probably the best way to fix our issue in this case
is to pull out a <code>start</code> method and then ensure that our unit test <em>does not call it.</em></p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>

<p>The complete code for this example (including a C++14-friendly
rewrite of <code>OncePerSecond</code>) is <a href="https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/code/2020-12-09-flash-of-unstyled-base-class.cpp">here</a>.</p>

<p>Compile with <code>-std=c++14</code> (or <code>-std=c++20 -DUSE_CXX20</code> if your compiler
provides the <code>&lt;semaphore&gt;</code> header already), and <code>-lgtest -lgtest_main</code> plus
whatever <code>-I -L</code> options you need for your local install of GTest.</p>

<p>Running with <code>./a.out --gtest_repeat=-1</code> should eventually reproduce the
segfault — at least it does on my machine!</p>

		<p>Using <em>@gmail.com</em> for your email address is like living at someone’s house
without rent and potentially being kicked out any day without warning. All your
belongings inside, without any access.</p>

<p>One of my first jobs around 1997 was being a sysadmin and managing email
servers, writing <code>sendmail.cf</code> configuration files without M4, and I should
have known better.</p>

<p>Someone who used Gmail for over 10 years <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">recently got locked
out</a>
without explanation. When all services you use, tools, and all your life are
connected to your <em>@gmail.com</em> address, you can imagine how much of a nightmare
scenario this is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It feels like getting baited by all the convenience that Google offers, only for Google to use your data as it pleases and possibly takes it all away with no prior notice.”</p>

  <p><cite>— <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10">What it’s like to get locked out of Google indefinitely</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gmail has been here for so long it’s hard to imagine they can take it away from
you just as quickly. And good luck to get it back once that happens… Therefore
I highly recommend using their <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Takeout</a> feature
to back up all your data and move away from using their domain <em>@gmail.com</em> in
your email address.</p>

<p>The unit of Internet space ownership is the domain name, get yours now.</p>

<p>I also use my <em>@gmail.com</em> too much because it’s easy, and its spam filtering
is so good. But I’ve reconsidered it, moved away, and use a non-public address
on my own domain when registering for new services. The following is a detail
of what I did and what I used to implement it.</p>

<h4 id="email-portability">Email portability</h4>

<p>Mobile phone numbers are so critical to everyday life that France has a law
allowing you to keep your phone number using a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relev%C3%A9_d%27identit%C3%A9_op%C3%A9rateur">Relevé d’identité
opérateur</a>
(carrier identity number) when changing carrier. This service must be provided
free of charge.</p>

<p>Email addresses are essential, and portability is as key for them as for phone
numbers. But you can’t keep the same address when switching from one provider
to another. Once you start using <em>something@gmail.com</em>, it is painful to move
to a new one as you have to change it on every service you use, confirming each
one, one by one.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1323582505065320448">@dhh says</a> <em>Hey!</em> will
forward your email for life once you paid for the first year. That should be
mandatory for all providers, so you don’t have this Gmail life single point of
failure. It’s best to own your own domain name, but this is a lesser evil than
most other email providers.</p>

<p>I believe email providers should be legally obliged to forward your email
address for life to a new email address. A routing system similar to
<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relev%C3%A9_d%27identit%C3%A9_op%C3%A9rateur">RIO</a>
preventing the old provider from having to forward them to the new one would be
best, but this is not technically possible with the SMTP Protocol.</p>

<p>Some people went as far as <a href="https://kevq.uk/de-googling-my-life-2-years-on/">De-Googling their
life</a> completely with success.</p>



<p>I created my <a href="https://www.hey.com/">hey</a> account for both making sure
fabienAThey.com would be mine if I ever wanted to use it, and for trying it
after viewing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI&amp;t=175s">this video</a>
about the service. Some of the features really make sense, like editing email
subjects <em>after</em> you received them or grouping multiple threads, but I still
prefer classic email interfaces.</p>

<p>After looking at a few options, I opted for
<a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> for their pricing, security disclaimer,
and overall good reputation. I used <a href="https://kolabnow.com/">Kolab</a> for years
but decided to move away. I also quickly tried Zoho but had a bad experience
with their UI trying to set things up.</p>

<p>I also used FM import feature to get all my old emails from Kolab back to FM.</p>

<p>I enabled catch-all emails on FM, meaning any email to my domain is redirected
to me. Anywhere I register, I use a different email address based on the
service’s name (service@my_domain_com). I can easily set specific filters like
anything sent to service@mydomain goes to its folder and skip the inbox, or
find who resell my email.</p>

<p>It used to be a real pain to do that, but the password manager included in
Safari (or 1Password) now remembers which email you used to register to a
service. You don’t have to remember that yourself anymore.</p>

<p>I added a server filter. Anything matching /unsubscribe/ goes to a specific
/unsub/ folder and skip the inbox. All newsletters usually get caught in this.
I enabled server-side spam filtering on FM and installed
<a href="https://c-command.com/spamsieve/">Spamsieve</a> on my laptop for a local bayesian
filter, moving detected spam to a Junk folder.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://freron.com/">Mailmate</a> to read emails, which is by far the best
email client I ever found on macOS (a long way from Linux and in order Elm,
Pine, Mutt, Gnus). I now remember why I started using Gmail… Because I was
coming from those MUA!</p>

                    <h3 id="every-hour-of-every-day-of-every-year">Every hour of every day of every year</h3><p>A framework I’ve found helpful for understanding what it means to get to 100% carbon-free electricity generation is a 24 x 365 grid. Each of the 8,760 squares represents an hour of power generation in the year that needs to be emissions free. I first came across this diagram reading <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-sustainability.appspot.com/pdf/24x7-carbon-free-energy-data-centers.pdf">Google’s 2019 discussion paper</a> on their corporate efforts to match 100% of their data center’s electricity demand with zero-carbon sources at every hour. In Google’s version of the diagram (shown below), green indicates a 100% clean energy match and grey means a 0% match. The gradation across each day and throughout the year reveals where there’s progress and where difficulties remain. More organizations in the private sector and in government should adopt this method of thinking about power generation for themselves or the region in which they are responsible. This framework makes the problem tractable and makes the end goal clear. Every hour of every day of every year must be 100% clean — each square needs to be solid green.</p><figure><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-12.43.00-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Example of 24 x 365 grid from Google's 2019 discussion paper</figcaption></figure><p>A benefit of the 24 x 365 diagram is the breakdown along the axes of time of day and time of year. Both are critical because the pathway to 100% clean energy runs through massively increasing solar and wind energy generation which are highly time dependent. While this framework makes visualizing the utilization of those two technologies easier, it also puts emphasis on the most important objective: Achieving 0 emissions from power generation at all times. The goal isn't just deploying 500 more megawatts of solar or closing down a specific natural gas plant, it’s about bringing each hour to 100% clean energy generation. Tactics should stay tactics while strategy is created to bring portions of the day or year to 100% zero emissions through any number of methods.</p><p>While useful on its own, the 24 x 365 grid is even better when paired with the ability to zoom in and observe the quantity and mix of power generated each day. These types of charts are common today among grid operators. <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/real-time-dashboard">NY ISO</a> and <a href="https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.html">CA ISO</a> both have real-time dashboards of energy mix on their respective websites.</p><p>With the 24 x 365 grid and the per day breakout in hand, we can reason about what improvements would happen if specific actions are taken. Consider the following two examples.</p><p><strong>Example 1: Adding more solar generation</strong></p><p>Building a new solar farm would immediately allow afternoon hours during the summer to achieve a higher level of carbon free generation. Using the two visuals we can quickly see where a solar farm would provide benefits during the year as well as a specific day.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png" width="2000" height="1097" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.17-PM.png 2282w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png" width="1772" height="1268" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-9.49.34-PM.png 1772w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Visualizations made using 2019 NY ISO data</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Example 2: Building a closed loop pumped hydro system</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower">Closed loop pumped hydro systems</a> can be thought of as very large water batteries.

This system enables providing non-intermittent power in the evenings across the year but especially in the winter months when shorter days make solar infeasible during the late afternoon and early evening.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.08.29-PM.png" width="2000" height="1092" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.08.29-PM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.08.29-PM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.08.29-PM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.08.29-PM.png 2292w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.09.01-PM.png" width="1742" height="1262" alt="" srcset="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.09.01-PM.png 600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.09.01-PM.png 1000w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.09.01-PM.png 1600w, https://www.climaticthoughts.com/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-05-at-10.09.01-PM.png 1742w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div><figcaption>Visualizations made using 2019 NY ISO data</figcaption></figure><p>Even tactics such as <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/articles/solar-plus-storage-101">short duration battery storage</a> and <a href="https://nest.com/energy-solutions/#rush-hour">demand response programs</a> can be visualized with this framework. Batteries can extend the window of operation for solar and wind by storing excess electricity production. A 4-hour capacity of battery storage can enable solar and wind to take on peak demand in the evening hours. Residential demand response programs, where customers are paid to use less energy during certain parts of the day, when mapped onto the 24 x 365 grid would also serve to make certain hours cleaner as fewer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant#:~:text=Peaking%20power%20plants%2C%20also%20known,as%20peak%20demand%2C%20for%20electricity.">peaker plants</a> would be needed to meet consumer demand. The per day breakout would similarly show a lower total quantity demanded and a cleaner mix of energy generation. These two visuals provide an easy way to conceptualize the effects of many different solutions all while keeping focus on the singular goal, 0 emissions at every single moment.</p><p>We collectively need to solve for 8,760 hours each year. Making each individual hour 100% clean will take a combination of technologies. What this visual framework provides is a map to gauge how far we’ve come and what remains. There’s a satisfaction that comes when checking off an item on a to-do list, we should consider this the same. 8,760 to-dos, some harder than others, but all equally necessary. I hope these visuals are used more broadly across the climate space both in the private and public sector.</p><p>Below I’ve created an <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/nitin.iyer#!/vizhome/shared/48H8ZRNTC">interactive version of the 24 x 365 grid</a> and per day demand graphs using data from the NY ISO in 2019. Hover the cursor over the 24 x 365 grid to see the breakout for an individual day.</p><p>Carbon Free and Fossil Fuel generation in the data:</p><ul><li>Carbon Free consists of: Hydro, Nuclear, Wind, and Other Renewables</li><li>Fossil generation consists of: Dual Fuel, Natural Gas, and Other Fossil Fuels</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html-->                <!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="low-hanging-hours-first">Low hanging hours first</h3><p>For any organization to have the most impact, the next step after constructing a snapshot of their 24 x 365 grid is to identify the low-hanging hours currently available. Low hanging hours are those hours of the day or year which are the easiest and cheapest to convert from fossil energy to clean energy. Depending on the geographic area that could be afternoons in July when the sun is always out and PV panels are readily available, or evenings in October when the wind blows continuously and turbines are relatively the cheapest. Not all hours of the day will be as easy or cheap to convert but emissions averted at 9 AM are the same as emissions averted at 12 PM. And in mitigating climate change, reducing emissions is of utmost importance.</p><p>On that last point, the advantages of tackling the low-hanging hours first are two-fold. One is that tackling those hours first preserves more of the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-much-carbon-budget-is-left-to-limit-global-warming-to-1-5c#:~:text=The%20models%2C%20labelled%20%E2%80%9CIPCC%20AR5,until%20the%20budget%20is%20exhausted.">“budget” of allowable emissions</a> for the harder to clean hours of the day. The nature of climate mitigation is that emissions averted sooner are much more valuable than emissions averted later. A <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-mitigation-2c">great illustration</a> of this concept comes from Robbie Andrew who shows how far emissions must fall in each subsequent year depending on when we hit peak emissions in order to stay under 2°C of warming. Assuming priority can only be given to one initiative at a time, the low hanging hours are the place to begin. This isn’t exactly like a to-do list where the common advice is tackle the hardest task of your day first. In that sense it's the complete opposite, clean the easiest parts of the day first and leave the difficult parts of the day for later.</p><p>The second advantage builds off of the first. As the low-hanging hours run out, demand for fossil energy will only exist for those harder to convert hours of the day. As a result, costs for fossil generation will increase as the fixed costs of those plants become spread across reduced hours of operation. Higher costs for fossil generation will make more expensive clean generation technologies such as <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/geothermal-power-plants.php#:~:text=Geothermal%20power%20plants%20use%20hydrothermal,or%20from%20hot%20water%20wells.&amp;text=The%20hot%20water%20or%20steam%20powers%20a%20turbine%20that%20generates%20electricity.">geothermal</a> more competitive. Without this demand reduction based cost increase or a price on carbon, these farther out zero-carbon baseload technologies may take too long to become cost competitive. This advantage could be hobbled by factors such as contract terms, political lobbying, or subsidies to fossil power generators. All of which may limit how fast fossil generation costs go up. But at some point the market overrides all barriers. Cheap energy is cheap energy.</p><p>Armed with the 24 x 365 framework and a strategy of addressing low hanging hours first, any organization is properly equipped to start the daunting task of getting to 100% clean energy. With climate change every solution is needed, but at the same time we cannot forget the power of prioritization. Tackling low hanging hours first provides some sense of direction in a flood of possible actions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>December 09, 2020</p></header><section><p>In Martin Fowler’s essay “Microservice Premium” he makes the argument that as
the complexity of a system increases, the productivity of a monolith architecture
starts out as very productive, but decreases in productivity faster than a service oriented
architecture (SOA), until a SOA is more productive than the monolith.</p>
<p>Here’s a chart he provides to illustrate:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>But, come on, when you add all the drawbacks of an SOA, the costs are enormous and they get worse.
Data syncing, backfilling, inconsistencies, progogation of bad data. Books upon books on how to
deal with the problems specific to using an SOA. It takes a truly terribly designed monolith
and a fantastically designed SOA for those lines to cross. The chart should really look like this:</p>

<p>As a project grows, most languages (Java, C++, Elixir)<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> take longer and longer to compile. Death
by a thousand slow-ish tests build up. CI pipelines take 20+ minutes. With 50 engineers trying
to get their code into master, it takes days to get merged. The vast majority of that
time spent waiting for CI (compiling, tests, linting). You have two options: make all of that
faster, or harken back to the good old days when your project was smaller by splitting it up.</p>
<p>The problem is, in the good old days, all your data was still in one database. That’s a terrible
idea in a SOA. Now you’re sacrificing all kinds of simplicity and safety to make your project
compile and test faster in smaller pieces. Invalid data being the root of all evil,
giving up foreign key constraints is selling your soul.</p>
<p>Or, you could make things faster:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>Seeing as making all of this fast once your project is already huge is very hard to do, I think
there are a few actionable points of advice I would like to leave with people starting new projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a language and ecosystem that prioritizes fast compiles and a fast feedback loop dev experience. i.e. Go.</li>
<li>Keep your tests fast from day one.</li>
<li>Do not preoptimize for microservices. Don’t over-engineer your code to work like an SOA. If you follow the first two points of advice, you may never have to go there at all. Boundaries are great, so theres a lot of gray area here, but I think its important to keep things <a href="https://atomkirk.com/2020-12-04-simple-as-possible-as-long-as-possible/">as simple as possible as long as possible</a>.</li>

            <p><strong>Dec 9, 2020</strong></p>
            
            <p>It turns out that sales tax has a huge, gigantic, terrible flaw: It punishes specialized businesses. A value added tax (VAT) has no such problems.</p>

<p>The US has sales tax. Most of the planet has VAT.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/VAT_map_updated.png" alt="VAT map"></p>

<p>Maybe it’s not the most important issue in the world, but it’s just so <em>clear</em>. Sales tax is dumb and VAT is better.</p>



<p>Many people apparently believe that in the US today, sales tax is only paid by final consumers. <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">THIS IS FALSE</a></strong>. It varies hugely by state, but the current situation is a hybrid between a “pure final retail consumer only” sales tax and what the toy model below describes. You can debate if it’s “sales tax” or “gross receipts tax” or whatever, but it’s a fact that <em>businesses pay tax on business inputs</em> all the time. You can find proof of this <a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/documents/standcomm/sccomfc/Business-Inputs-Study.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41788786">here</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_receipts_tax#United_States">here</a>.</p>

<p>I emphasize that the explanation below is a toy illustration. The US tax code isn’t <i>nearly</i> this bad. But the flaw described <i>does</i> exist. I beg you: <strong><a href="https://www.cost.org/globalassets/cost/state-tax-resources-pdf-pages/cost-studies-articles-reports/1903-3073001_cost-ey-sales-tax-on-business-inputs-study_final-5-16.pdf">IF YOU THINK THE US DOESN’T HAVE TAXES WITH THE FLAW DESCRIBED BELOW PLEASE READ THIS LINK. SO FAR I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYONE WHO HAS READ THIS YET CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT.</a></strong></p>

<p>OK, let’s continue.</p>



<p>Say you decide to get into the decorative <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/12/09/sales-tax-creates-more-unnecessary-pain-than-value-added-tax/(https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/11/comparative-advantage-and-when-to-blow-up-your-island/)">coconut</a> manufacturing business.</p>

<p>You’re good at painting coconuts. You find a friend who is good at picking them, and another who’s good at making coconut paint. You find a third friend who’s a genius with applying finishing lacquer and a fourth who runs a store.</p>

<p>You buy coconuts and paint, apply the paint, then sell to the finisher. He applies lacquer and sells to a retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/supply_chain.jpg" alt="supply chain"></p>

<p>After negotiating prices, you settle on $1 for a raw coconut, $1 for a coconut’s worth of paint, $3 for a painted coconut, $4 for a finished coconut, and $5 retail. This works out to everyone making $1 of profit.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/market.jpg" alt="market"></p>

<p>Here’s a table showing the accounts:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Cost of inputs</th>
      <th>Profit</th>
      <th>Price</th>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Raw coconuts</td>
      <td>$0</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Paint</td>

      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Painted coconut</td>
      <td>$2 (raw coconut+paint)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Finished coconut</td>
      <td>$3 (painted coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>
      <td>$4 (finished coconut)</td>
      <td>$1</td>
      <td>$5</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>For a while, everything runs beautifully. Every day you wake eager to help capture more beauty in coconut form — and then the government announces a 20% sales tax. Whenever you sell something, you need to pay 20% of the sale price to the government.</p>

<p>You talk it over. Everyone feels they still deserve to make the same $1 profit as before. Since you now pay $1.20 for a raw coconut and $1.20 for paint, you need to mark up to $3.40 before tax, and $4.08 after.</p>

<p>After everyone marks up their prices in this way, here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/sales_tax.jpg" alt="sales tax"></p>

    <tr>
      <td>Retail coconut</td>

      <td>$8.52</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Your customers aren’t thrilled about the increase in price, but what are they going to do — live <em>without</em> painted coconuts? So they pay the higher price, the government gets its tax, and life continues.</p>



<p>A few months later, your unscrupulous  cousin hears about your business. He’s the jealous type and decides to try stealing your customers. He opens a store and finds four friends to help make coconuts. Unlike you, however, he hires everyone as <em>employees</em>. He sells the coconuts for $6 ($5 plus tax) and gives everyone $1 per coconut in wages.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/vat/integrated.jpg" alt="integrated"></p>

<p>Your cousin and friends don’t appreciate the subtle art of coconut decoration. Everyone agrees yours are better but they start to complain: Why are you charging $8.52 when a slightly worse product is available for only $6? Slowly, your loyal customers drift away and you go out of business.</p>

<p>How could this happen? Your team was asking for the same profit while doing a better job! Yet everyone is left with your cousin’s knock-off coconuts.</p>



<p>Suppose the government had instead announced a 20% VAT. With a VAT, whenever you sell something, you only pay tax on the sale price <em>minus the price of the stuff you bought to make it</em>.</p>

<p>As before, you’ll need to pay $1.20 for raw coconuts and $1.20 paint. You charge $3.40 for painted coconuts, now you’re only taxed on the profit of $3.40-$2.40=$1.00. The price with tax is now $3.60.</p>

<p>Here are the final prices as they go through through the system. Everyone is making a profit of $1, so everyone pays a tax of $0.20.</p>

<p>The final price is $6.00. Since your coconuts are better, your cousin won’t be able to drive you out of business with his low-grade stuff.</p>



<p>What happened? Your cousin created a <em>vertically integrated</em> business. A sales tax is collected every time someone buys something. If you just do it yourself, no tax is collected.</p>

<p>Are vertically integrated businesses bad? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>However, take your chain of independent independent artisans making and selling coconut products. Imagine someone invents a paint that customers prefer. You almost <em>have</em> to switch, or some other painter will drive you out of business. Contrast this with cousin’s integrated business making all coconuts. In theory, the inventor could convince your cousin to hire him or license the paint process. If he won’t be convinced, the only way for that paint to get to customers is if the inventor develops an entire independent coconut manufacturing chain. Vertical integration means there are price signals at fewer points during production, which tends to make it harder for innovations to thrive.</p>

<p>There are times where vertical integration is better. (If everyone is independent, a lot of time is spent on negotiations!) That’s perfectly fine. What we <em>don’t</em> want is to artificially encourage vertical integration even when it’s less efficient, which sales tax does.</p>



<p>Another advantage of the VAT is it tends to be easier to enforce. When I sell something, I need to provide certificates proving I paid VAT on my inputs. This gives everyone an incentive to ensure compliance in the previous layer of the chain. With a sales tax, the government needs to watch every single transaction.</p>

<p>Of course, people know sales tax is distortionary. Many exceptions exist to minimize the worst distortions. For example, a retailer usually won’t pay sales tax on a manufactured good they intend to a consumer in the same form. Without this exception, we’d probably have a crazy economy where manufacterers sell directly to consumers. The messy patchwork of exceptions reduces the problems with sales tax but doesn’t eliminate them.</p>

<p>I think there are two major reasons to oppose replacing sales tax with VAT. The first is a Leninist “worse is better” attitude. If you think <em>all taxes are bad</em> then you’d want to keep them painful and visible so people will be maximally annoyed by them. The second is that VAT is complicated to administer, particularly when sales tax can be different in each local area. This might be true, but I find it a bit hard to believe. VAT is more self-enforcing and sales taxes are <em>already</em> a nightmare, particularly for anyone selling to different cities/states. If we’re keeping the sales tax to keep things simple, where’s the payoff?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        
<p>Choosing a stack is most often more of a tribal endeavor than a something done on merit. Developers often mistakenly
    think that their favorite language is somehow measurably better than others. They feel that using it will make for
    clean code or better productivity. I think there is fairly little support for any of that. What I think matters are
    <strong>the capabilities of the language</strong> and its runtime, <strong>the culture of its ecosystem</strong> and
    community and <strong>the history of proven performance</strong>. My intent with this post is to underline what I
    see as pure business advantages with working with Elixir. By necessity I will also touch on a wide selection of
    other languages to set the baseline.</p>
<h2 id="java--net---the-corporate-baseline">Java &amp; .Net - The corporate baseline</h2>
<p>In the enterprise there is a strong tendency to Java &amp; C#. Why? Because no one ever got fired for choosing them.
    They are stable workhorse languages with mostly identical featuresets, the same level of abstraction, solid
    performance and all the ecosystem that you'd ever want. They both provide a mid-to-high level of abstraction for the
    common case, are strict at the core but aspire to be more dynamic and place some correctness constraints on your
    developer with types. Applications can be written to be very strict and quite formal. Culturally they are well
    suited to a risk-averse business.</p>
<p>Choosing Java or .Net is not a competitive advantage. You are not innovating with this choice, you also aren't
    chosing something that guarantees reliability or safety. These languages aren't inherently more safe, secure or
    reliable. It is a risk-averse and uninteresting choice and it assumes you can compete elsewhere. It gives you no
    advantage, it poses no large drawbacks. It is the default for this class of business.</p>
<h2 id="ruby--node---the-agile-baseline">Ruby &amp; Node - The agile baseline</h2>
<p>In the startup world the stacks vary a bit more but Ruby was the darling and Node.js is the currently dominant
    life-form. Also worth mentioning are Python and PHP. Which are all roughly equivalent. High level of abstraction,
    highly dynamic, minimal restraint. To a venture-backed, forward-leaning or experimental and fast business, these are
    all desirable traits and a good culture fit.</p>
<p>Choosing these are not a competitive advantage. Maybe some mobility versus the corporate baseline because there is no
    strictness at the language level. These languages are all largely equivalent. You have no real advantage, you have
    no special drawbacks. You are using the default for your type of business.</p>
<h2 id="no-advantage-in-the-default">No advantage in the default</h2>
<p>By choosing the default for either type of business you are making a very small choice between dynamic or a bit
    stricter and between compiled and interpreted. These are technical concerns that mostly do not affect business
    outcomes but are popular for developers to rant about. <strong>Your choice of language among these options is not
        giving you any distinguishable advantage. Because they are basically the same.</strong></p>
<h2 id="specialist-languages">Specialist languages</h2>
<p>It is worth mentioning that some languages own certain domains and dominate them in a way that just means choosing
    them makes sense. Primarily this is Python for data and machine learning. The alternatives here are all
    significantly less common languages. Swift or Obj-C are for iOS. Kotlin for Android. Then you have projects where
    you need C/C++/Rust level speeds which steers you to those languages. Or maybe you are trying to embed a language in
    your system, then I hear Lua is good.</p>
<p>But <em>most development projects today are general-purpose</em>. They are <strong>distributed systems</strong> with
    some amount of Web APIs or Web UIs. They often have some semi-real-time going on via WebSockets. They require
    integration with other parties via APIs. And what do you want?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast response times</li>
<li>Uptime</li>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Maintainable architecture</li>
<li>Decent efficiency from the hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is Elixir's specialty? Distributed systems with high reliability and soft real-time response times. This maps
    incredibly tightly to what most systems need these days.</p>
<h2 id="unopinionated-generic">Unopinionated, generic</h2>
<p>The baseline languages offer no particular opinions about what a good system design should look like. They are
    generic languages, mostly OOP, with every paradigm they can fit thrown in for good measure. There is no direction to
    be found. Your developers can build as well or poorly as their skills and patience allows.</p>
<p>In this I think Elixir distinguishes itself. It builds on the needs of some of the <em>really early distributed
        systems</em>,
    which were telecom switches, that were developed at Ericsson. They built Erlang, which Elixir builds on top of. It
    implements the Actor model. The Actor model + the Functional Programming paradigm are combined not just because they
    sound cool but because <strong>they give certain guarantees</strong> and <em>they constrain the way you build
        code</em> in a way that <strong>makes it
        significantly easier to build distributed systems</strong> without screwing it up too bad.</p>
<p>They developed an approach called supervision trees that is used to provide a core level of resiliency for the
    simplest casest and a toolset to create the serious level of resiliency needed for a piece of telecom
    infrastructure. The idea being that if your system can drop a call, which any system can, it should not cause
    failures for other callers and it should not bring the entire node down with it.</p>
<p>It is a design <strong>built to achieve nines</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h2>
<p>Staying with baseline languages you get the default pool of candidates. It is a vast pool with a very wide level of
    experience, quality and skill. The average is .. quite average. There are many people invested and excited about
    each of these languages and there are people that absolutely do not care and trudge on through. The whole range is
    there.</p>
<p>Most people come to Elixir from other languages because it is still comparatively niche. Very few people start their
    career in Elixir today. So the pool is smaller and the average developer did not learn this in a boot camp a few
    months ago. So the average Elixir developer has previous experience and it seems like the general reasons people are
    attracted to the language is that it allows building things in a more reliable fashion. These are concerns that I
    firmly believe are more common with experienced developers because they generally mean you have been burned before.
    For some numbers that indicate this experience difference you can see that <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#top-paying-technologies">Elixir is the 5th highest paid</a>
    language worldwide. This is a decent marker for experience.</p>
<p>When you bring on an Elixir developer, the chance that you are bringing on valuable experience is high, even if you
    interview poorly the statistics are in your favor. I see developers that actively strive to transition into Elixir
    on a daily basis. This increases the chance of getting highly motivated developers, self-driven who are invested in
    their Elixir skills. It hits <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">8th most Loved
        languages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="unique-selling-points">Unique Selling Points</h2>
<p>Elixir can do all the normal things you expect from high abstraction level dynamic language. Culturally it has become
    the spiritual successor to Ruby. Startups are flocking to it. So it can do all the uninteresting work-horse stuff
    that you need in the line of business. The competitive advantage is in what it brings beyond the baseline.</p>
<p>Elixir runs on the BEAM virtual machine. It <strong>provides uncommon guarantees and capabilities</strong> since it
    is built to
    provide soft real-time, which means a <em>very low latency</em>, <em>strong concurrency</em> and distribution
    without all the traps
    and errors common in concurrent code. It even provides the possibility to <strong>update the system without stopping
        it</strong> if your use-case is so critical that application restarts are unacceptable. You might not need these
    starting out. But retrofitting
    any of these capabilities is in the range of very costly to impossible.</p>
<p>You get the power to do clustered applications basically for free. You get strong multi-core performance without any
    further concern. Legend tells of the numerous Ruby instances that were scaled down into a few lonely nodes as the
    code transitioned to Elixir. You might even save money on your cloud bills.</p>
<p>Elixir and the Phoenix web framework come with strong developer ergonomics, providing a less mysterious approach that
    is reminiscent of the productivity monster that is Ruby on Rails (or Django, or Laravel).</p>
<p>Phoenix LiveView is probably the most interesting project at this moment where UI work can be done without touching
    Javascript which allows an incredibly tight, simplified and pragmatic approach to UI/UX development for many, many
    use-cases. For many applications this can quite simply remove a few programmers from payroll. For others it can
    simplify things significantly.</p>
<p>Web systems aside there is an entirely unique IoT and connected smart devices story with the Nerves project which
    solves not just tooling for building IoT devices. It also implements an incredible solution for maintaining your
    fleet of devices with updates and maintenance via NervesHub.</p>
<p>And when you need native performance there are a number of ways in which you can achieve this. Just like in all other
    languages there are escape hatches to getting closer to the metal and pressing the computer for all its worth.</p>
<h2 id="proven-performance--historical-record">Proven performance &amp; historical record</h2>
<p>Do you dare using something new and .. unproven?</p>
<p>You probably should. But you don't have to. <strong>Elixir is not unproven.</strong></p>
<p>Elixir is a recent language, certainly but it has been around for years and is stable. More importantly, Elixir is
    built on top of Erlang and the BEAM virtual machine. These were <strong>established in 1986</strong>. They were
    <em>open sourced in 1998</em>. Since then they've been used with great but quiet success in many places. <strong>The
        reputation of Erlang is that it is battle-hardened and proven to be reliable.</strong> It has always had …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Historically, development teams and operations teams have been at odds.<br></p><p>Development teams wanted to add slick new features to products. Operations teams wanted to make sure these features didn’t cause dysfunction.<br></p><p>This began to change in 2003 when software engineer Benjamin Treynor invented site reliability engineering (SRE) while working at Google. He made his software engineering team responsible for some ops tasks, creating the concept of SRE and helping to resolve issues between development and operations.</p><h2>How does SRE work?</h2><p>SRE is performed by site reliability engineers, also known as service reliability engineers. These professionals are typically software developers who have gained some operations experience. They can also be IT professionals who have development skills.<br></p><p>SRE teams set service-level agreements (SLAs) for each service in a system. The SLAs define the system’s required reliability, helping teams figure out which features they can implement.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Within each SLA are service-level indicators (SLIs) and service-level objectives (SLOs).<br></p><p>SLIs are metrics that measure a specific aspect of a service level. Examples of SLIs you might want to monitor could be availability, error rate, or system throughput.<br></p><p>An SLO is simply the target you want to hit for an SLI. For example, you might shoot for a 99.9% availability over the course of a year.<br></p><p>The difference is the downtime level. The downtime level is known as the “error-budget,” which is the maximum amount of error allowed in the system.&nbsp;<br></p><p>By acknowledging the error is inevitable, you can then plan for the errors, making it easier for the development team to release new features. See, the development team can release whatever features they want—whenever they want—as long as they stay within the error budget. As soon as they step outside of it, they must reign in errors before moving forward with new features.<br></p><p>A vital part of an SRE’s work is automation. SREs often have to automate away repetitive manual tasks, called “toil,” so they can focus on long-term, value-adding work. <a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/post/understanding-kubernetes">Kubernetes</a> can be helpful with this.</p><h2>DevOps vs. SRE</h2><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/">DevOps</a> is a philosophy and set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It consists of <a href="https://www.overops.com/blog/devops-vs-sre-whats-the-difference-between-them-and-which-one-are-you/">five pillars</a>. Google defines these pillars as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Reducing organizational silos</li><li>Accepting failure as normal</li><li>Implementing gradual changes</li><li>Leveraging tooling and automation</li><li>Measuring everything<br></li></ul><p>If DevOps is the “what,” SRE is the “how.” It’s simply an implementation of the DevOps philosophy. In fact, SRE meets all five pillars of DevOps:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reducing organizational silos:</strong> SREs share ownership with the developers, and they use the same tools and techniques.</li><li><strong>Accepting failure as normal:</strong> SREs quantify failure using SLIs and SLOs. They assume that errors will happen, but set a maximum allowable amount to balance failure against new releases.</li><li><strong>Implementing gradual changes:</strong> SREs encourage smaller, more iterative deployments of new features in order to reduce the cost of failure.</li><li><strong>Leveraging tooling and automation:</strong> SREs automate away manual tasks, as mentioned above.</li><li><strong>Measuring everything:</strong> SREs use metrics (SLIs) to quantify service levels. Consequently, they can keep errors down.</li></ul><h2>Benefits of SRE</h2><p>Let’s take a look at a few of the ways SRE can offer some major advantages to your organization.&nbsp;</p><h3>Provides clear metrics</h3><p>Clear metrics allow SRE teams to highlight areas of improvement, such as reducing security vulnerabilities.<br></p><p>SRE teams can also use metrics to calculate impact in other areas, such as revenue. For example, they could look at how much revenue they lose per minute of downtime.</p><h3>Improves code</h3><p>The development and SRE teams share the same talent pool. If the development team writes poor code, more talent is allocated to the SREs to fix these issues—leaving fewer people available for the development team.<br></p><p>As a result, the development team is incentivized to write better code. When their code works well, they could gain more teammates, bringing them the resources they need to create better features.</p><h3>Frees up time and resources to add value</h3><p>Better code, fewer bugs, and more efficiency creates more time to add value to the product.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The developers can create better and more exciting features that are less likely to cause problems. On the other side, operations can spend more time testing and performing upkeep.<br></p><p>Put these together, and you have a better product for the customer.</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>SRE is quickly taking hold as an essential part of many organizations. It can help close the gap between operations and development. Consequently, you can deliver better applications faster—without sacrificing the reliability of those applications.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Cortex can help your SRE team track service quality better so they can find more areas where service can be improved.<a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/"> Schedule your demo today</a> to learn more about what we can do.</p></div></div>]]>

It made me wonder if my expectations weren't clear, or whether I had misunderstood our progress."</strong></p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>5)&nbsp;Come with questions, not conclusions</strong></h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Be careful not to make too many assumptions. Present questions and be genuinely curious about the situation. Often you may find yoursef as a contributing factor to the behavior.

    <article>

        

        <section>

            <p>I think we, as a profession, shot ourselves in the foot when we coined the term <em>tech debt</em>. This <a href="https://daverupert.com/2020/11/technical-debt-as-a-lack-of-understanding/">recent post</a> (though my browser’s search bar found no less than 3 recent articles I read on the subject in Hacker News) got me thinking that the term tech debt is an exercise in bad marketing.</p>

<p>Debt is evil. It’s the stuff that can <a href="https://money.com/student-loan-forgiveness-death-discharge/">live on</a> longer than you do. There’s never been an instance where calling something “debt” elicited a positive response. So why do we tell our Product Managers we have to <em>tackle</em> tech debt?</p>

<p>Is it to create urgency? I hope not. Everyone believes their priorities are the most important priorities. So an engineer’s tech debt will never seem more important than a PM’s product backlog.</p>

<p>Is it to create gravity around the seriousness of the work involved? Then why is it that PMs always bucket “20% time” for making room for tech debt that is never fully paid off?</p>

<p>I loved this analogy I saw on Hacker News about this concept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you run a commercial kitchen and you only ever cook food, because selling cooked food is your business – if you never clean the dishes, never scrape the grill, never organize the freezer – the health inspector will shut your shit down pretty quickly.</p>

  <p>Software, on the other hand, doesn’t have health inspectors. It has kitchen staff who become more alarmed over time at the state of the kitchen they’re working in every day, and if nothing is done about it, there will come a point where the kitchen starts failing to produce edible meals.</p>

  <p>Generally, you can either convince decision makers that cleaning the kitchen is more profitable in the long run or you can dust off your resume and get out before it burns down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the flip side, if you ever have the luxury of getting ahead of your technical debt then you can contribute things called <a href="https://www.stillbreathing.co.uk/2016/10/13/technical-credit">technical credits</a>. As you can imagine, technical credits are the opposite of tech debt: things that <em>pay dividends</em> to your code rather than incur a cost and drag it down. <a href="https://gomakethings.com/progressive-enhancement-graceful-degradation-and-asynchronously-loading-css/">Progressive enhancement</a> is touted as an example of technical credit.</p>

<p>Marrying these two concepts, I actually think a way around the horrible marketing of tech debt can be resolved with Agile terminology that is already familiar to our product-positive counterparts: <strong>engineering-driving work.</strong></p>

<h2 id="engineering-driven-work-over-tech-debt">Engineering-driven work over tech debt</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, whether they be debt or credit, the work engineers want to accomplish to make their code better is something personal to them and them alone. Similarly, your product team has their own vision of what your code can become for your customers. So if we segment on the <em>owner</em> instead of the <em>outcome</em> we remove the negative connotations of the work involved.</p>

<p>On my teams, we make this distinction painfully simple in Jira:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Was the work engineering-driven?</strong> Create a task.</li>
  <li><strong>Was the work product-driven?</strong> Create a story; use sub-tasks to create the work the engineers will do to complete that story.</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything lives on the same playing field and is up for grabs to assign priority. So rather than bucket 20% time for debt, if all engineering-driven tasks (whether they be credits, debts, or something else) are the most important work to be done this week, they take up 100% of the sprint. Similarly, if product’s work is the most important, it can dominate or completely own a sprint.</p>

<p>The important thing is that <strong>the owner of the ticket sells why their work should be as important as it is</strong>. If you can’t sell why a critical security upgrade is vital to the health of your application then you need to learn how to sell and influence others. But then again, you might think that switching from Formik to React Hook Forms would be awesome but if it’s based on personal bias and no tangible value creation for developer productivity you’re dead on arrival.</p>

<p>So I encourage all of my engineers to read sales books. Learn how to sell and influence others. Convincing someone that what you want to do matters is a much better message than starting things off on the wrong foot by calling your work debt that needs to be repaid. Debt makes people wince. Creating value makes people smile. Paying down tech debt adds value so lead with that and focus on why your work is important instead of giving it the Scarlet Letter from the onset.</p>

<p><span><strong>Preface to the third edition</strong></span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 7">
<div>
<div>
<p>No extensive changes have been made in this edition. The most important are in §§ 80–82, which I have rewritten in accordance with suggestions made by Mr S. Pollard.</p>
<p>The earlier editions contained no satisfactory account of the genesis of the circular functions. I have made some attempt to meet this objection in § 158 and Appendix III. Appendix IV is also an addition.</p>
<p>It is curious to note how the character of the criticisms I have had to meet has changed. I was too meticulous and pedantic for my pupils of fifteen years ago: I am altogether too popular for the Trinity scholar of to-day. I need hardly say that I find such criticisms very gratifying, as the best evidence that the book has to some extent fulfilled the purpose with which it was written.</p>

<div class="page" title="Page 7">
<div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>Extract from the preface to the second edition</strong></span></p>
<p>The principal changes made in this edition are as follows. I have inserted in Chapter I a sketch of Dedekind’s theory of real numbers, and a proof of Weierstrass’s theorem concerning points of condensation; in Chapter IV an account of ‘limits of indetermination’ and the ‘general principle of convergence’; in Chapter V a proof of the ‘Heine-Borel Theorem’, Heine’s theorem concerning uniform continuity, and the fundamental theorem concerning implicit functions; in Chapter VI some additional matter concerning the integration of algebraical functions; and in Chapter VII a section on differentials. I have also rewritten in a more general form the sections which deal with the definition of the definite integral. In order to find space for these insertions I have deleted a good deal of the analytical geometry and formal trigonometry contained in Chapters II and III of the first edition. These changes have naturally involved a large number of minor alterations.</p>

<p><em>October</em> 1914</p>
<p><span><strong>Extract from the preface to the first edition</strong></span></p>
<p>This book has been designed primarily for the use of first year students at the Universities whose abilities reach or approach something like what is usually described as ‘scholarship standard’. I hope that it may be useful to other classes of readers, but it is this class whose wants I have considered first. It is in any case a book for mathematicians: I have nowhere made any attempt to meet the needs of students of engineering or indeed any class of students whose interests are not primarily mathematical.</p>
<p>I regard the book as being really elementary. There are plenty of hard examples (mainly at the ends of the chapters): to these I have added, wherever space permitted, an outline of the solution. But I have done my best to avoid the inclusion of anything that involves really difficult ideas. For instance, I make no use of the `principle of convergence’: uniform convergence, double series, infinite products, are never alluded to: and I prove no general theorems whatever concerning the inversion of limit-operations—I never even define $\dfrac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial x\, \partial y}$ and $\dfrac{\partial^{2} f}{\partial y\, \partial x}$. In the last two chapters I have occasion once or twice to integrate a power-series, but I have confined myself to the very simplest cases and given a special discussion in each instance. Anyone who has read this book will be in a position to read with profit Dr Bromwich’s <em>Infinite Series</em>, where a full and adequate discussion of all these<br>
points will be found.</p>

James echoed that in her press conference, saying Facebook "used its monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users."</p>  <p>The FTC fined Facebook $5 billion US in 2019 for privacy violations and instituted new oversight and restrictions on its business. The fine was the largest the agency has ever levied on a tech company, although it had no visible impact on Facebook's business.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834798.1607545802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/facebook-antritrust.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834798.1607545802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/facebook-antritrust.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834798.1607545802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/facebook-antritrust.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834798.1607545802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-antritrust.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834798.1607545802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/facebook-antritrust.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834798.1607545802!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-antritrust.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A demonstrator joins others outside of the home of Zuckerberg in November to protest what they say is Facebook spreading disinformation in San Francisco.

Amazon and Apple also have been under investigation in Congress and by federal authorities for alleged anticompetitive conduct.</p>  <p>The Justice Department's suit against Google, announced just two weeks before election day, brought accusations of political motivation from some quarters. It was filed by a cabinet agency headed by an attorney general seen as a close ally of President Donald Trump, who has often publicly criticized Google.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834792.1607545721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/facebook-protest.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834792.1607545721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/facebook-protest.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834792.1607545721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/facebook-protest.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834792.1607545721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-protest.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834792.1607545721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/facebook-protest.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834792.1607545721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/facebook-protest.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A man who did not give his name wears a mask of Zuckerberg as he and others demonstrate outside of Zuckerberg's home to protest what they say is Facebook spreading disinformation in San Francisco on Nov. 21.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Jeff Chiu/The Associated Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The FTC, by contrast, is an independent regulatory agency whose five commissioners currently include three Republicans and two Democrats.</p>  <p>U.S. president-elect Joe Biden has said the breakup of Big Tech giants should be seriously considered. He has singled out Facebook's Zuckerberg for scorn, calling him "a real problem."</p>  <h2>'Monopoly power'</h2>  <p>Facebook paid $1 billion US for Instagram, bolstering the social networking platform's portfolio a month before its stock went public. At the time, the photo-sharing app had about 30 million users and wasn't producing any revenue. Zuckerberg vowed both companies would be run independently, but over the years the services have become increasingly integrated with users able to link accounts and share content across the platforms. Instagram now has more than 1 billion users worldwide. Facebook acquired WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging service, for $19 billion US.</p>    <p>But in the following&nbsp;years, the founders of both Instagram and WhatsApp left Facebook amid disagreements with Zuckerberg. Facebook has started to integrate Instagram and WhatsApp, most recently by linking the apps' chat functions with its Messenger service. Such integration could make it more difficult to break off the companies.</p>  <p>NetChoice, a Washington trade association that includes Facebook as a member, quickly panned the lawsuits. The case for antitrust enforcement against Facebook "has never been weaker," NetChoice vice-president Carl Szabo said in a statement, pointing to newer social services such as TikTok and Snapchat as rivals that could "overtake" older platforms.</p>    <p>"These lawsuits mark an important turning point in the battle to rein in Big Tech monopolies and to reinvigorate antitrust enforcement," said Alex Harman, competition policy advocate for Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[<strong>TL;DR:</strong> I think this place has a real shot, but I’d still live in California once it’s back online.]</p> <p>Is Miami the next startup capital? It has excellent food. Great weather. Affordable housing. Durable American infrastructure. Pro-tech local government. So why not Miami?</p> <p>Paul Graham has an excellent essay titled <a href="http://paulgraham.com/cities.html">“Cities and Ambition”</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder.</p> <p>New York tells you, above all: you should make more money. There are other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You should be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be richer.</p> <p>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message there is: you should be smarter.</p> </blockquote> <p>Later on in this 2008 piece PG writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>At the moment, San Francisco’s message seems to be the same as Berkeley’s: you should live better.</p> <p>But this will change if enough startups choose SF over the Valley. During the Bubble that was a predictor of failure — a self-indulgent choice, like buying expensive office furniture.</p> <p>Even now I’m suspicious when startups choose SF. But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift there.</p> </blockquote> <p>An impressive foreshadowing of the future, as everything changed 3 years later. Dropbox, Stripe, Airbnb, and a few other unicorns moved to SF, and it suddenly became the place to be. (Coincidentally, SF would become horribly mismanaged. Living there became a predictor of sacrifice, not self-indulgence.)</p> <p>That is the issue with Miami right now. If New York tells you to make money, Miami tells you: you should enjoy yourself. You should get a tan. Buy a nice car.</p> <p>Miami also has a very particular brand. Saying one is in Miami – to others that are not familiar with it – engenders a sense of vacation. Miami feels like a city of sunshine and bliss, not discipline and dedication. It feels too nice. The perfect frontier might feel slightly unpleasant to afford for positive selection effects.</p> <p>[1]</p> <h3 id="the-tel-aviv-paradox">The Tel Aviv Paradox</h3> <p>Why do cities develop such particular personalities?</p> <p>Some people think it’s the weather. Bay Area weather is to innovation what Earth is to intelligent life. Make it slightly warmer or slightly colder, and things don’t work. Warm nights feel great but too librating, leading to drink and debauchery. Too cold and the frigid winters don’t allow for <em>any</em> cross-pollination of ideas as communities remain small and insulated, refraining from visiting each other.</p> <p>Maybe it’s the scenery. Walking amongst the Redwoods of California is what’s actually driving inspiration?</p> <p>Others say that Miami can’t work because it’s a beach town. Beach towns are too much fun. You move for pleasure, not sacrifice. Having grown up in Israel, I find myself thinking of Tel Aviv. A <em>very</em> fine beach, with plenty of drinking and shenaniganizing, yet it has more startups per capita than London, Berlin, or Seattle. So beaches aren’t a killer.</p> <p>Predicting the personality from geological settings seems hard. Like endless nature/nurture reasoning, but for cities instead of people.</p> <h3 id="gravitational-orbit">Gravitational Orbit</h3> <p>In reality, environment might not matter. 95% of the success of any city might simply be the location of the top five cool tech companies. Get those to move, everything else follows. What founders really want is to be in the gravitational orbit of big planets. If the next SpaceX and Instacart move to Miami, that might be enough to create a second-tier Silicon Valley.</p> <p>I don’t think Miami will <em>beat</em> Silicon Valley simply due to human capital network effects: Instacart won’t move because the best engineering managers are in the valley, the best EMs are in the valley because many companies are there, etc. (Even if the Bay Area were to fall like Rome, I doubt Miami would capture 100% of the diffusion.)</p> <p>I don’t believe the location of VCs matters anymore (VCs will fund fast growth regardless of location), unless the VCs that move drag along with them a few unicorn headquarters.</p> <h3 id="in-closing">In Closing</h3> <p>There’s an opening in the market. Miami has a shot – not at besting Google (== California), but at least at launching Bing. It has the brand of parties and beaches. But just like SF, style can change[2]. Really all you need for a startup city is (1) affordable housing and (2) three unicorn headquarters. If Miami were to attract a few <em>highly</em> applauded and technical unicorn headquarters (e.g. SpaceX, Snowflake, Instacart) to relocate in the next year, while California is in temporary hiatus and the narrative of “Silicon Valley has migrated to the cloud, you can be anywhere” is rampant[3], the city would mint economies overnight.</p> <p>A second-place startup center would be a capital achievement, one many Mayors and Presidents would die for.</p> <hr> <p>[1] For what it’s worth, I’ve come to judge the Miami aesthetic less harshly over time. Every city has a status hierarchy. San Francisco has blue checkmarks and Miami has green Lamborghini’s. This is how people demonstrate competency here. The same operating system with different icons.</p> <p>[2] Some would say SF only worked because of proximity to Sand Hill Road, but it seems as of late that VCs will finance any company with good growth, regardless of location. So the linkage might be less significant now. Talent networks still matter, but a joint exodus of unicorns plus Zoom might be sufficient to sow the seed.</p> <p>[3] Like all narratives, I imagine this one – of “remote work forever!” will fade over time. We’ll remember that, gosh, real-world offices are, in fact, great!</p> </article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Using Tailwind UI and Next.js Together]]>

December 9, 2020 | https://www.khanna.law/blog/using-tailwind-ui-and-next-js-together | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.khanna.law/blog/using-tailwind-ui-and-next-js-together">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>This process has gotten much easier with the <a href="https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2">release of TailwindCSS 2.0</a>. These instructions have been updated to reflect the installation process for TailwindCSS 2.0 and Next.js 10.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> is an incredible framework for building server-side React applications. <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> is a utility-first CSS framework that makes designing and building websites a breeze. And <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> is a commercial set of pre-baked components made in Tailwind CSS by two incredible designers, Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger. Using these tools together, I can develop whole web applications that look beautiful, from scratch, in record time.</p>
<p>To figure out the right way to set them up together, I pulled the relevant pieces of documentation from each of Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI and synthesized them into this guide. I reference and link to those parts of documentation where appropriate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up Next.js with Tailwind CSS in development</li>
<li>Add Tailwind UI</li>
<li>Optimize for production with PurgeCSS</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Set Up Next.js and Tailwind CSS in Development</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs">Next.js-specific TailwindCSS installation instructions</a> do an excellent job of getting you setup with both of these in a project. Complete the steps there and come back here when you're done.</p>
<p>Confirm it works by running <code>npm run dev</code> and navigating in your browser to <code>localhost:3000</code>, where you should see a page that looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.khanna.law/assets/blog/using-tailwind-ui-and-next-js-together/next-js-screenshot.png" alt="Next.js Default Page"></p>
<p>Edit <code>pages/index.js</code> to use some Tailwind CSS classes to make sure its working:</p>
<pre><code>// pages/index.js
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Next.js TailwindCSS&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico"/&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;

      &lt;div className="container mx-auto"&gt;
        &lt;h1 className="text-lg text-center m-4"&gt;TailwindUI/Next.js&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p className="bg-green-600"&gt;This is a test of the tailwind next integration.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>If Next.js has put a <code>Home.module.css</code> file in the <code>styles/</code> directory, you should delete that since that file just has the styling for the Next.js example page and should not be used anymore.</p>
<p>If it doesn't look like it working, you may need to stop the Next.js dev server and restart it because it may not pick up the changes to the <code>postcss.config.js</code> file unless you do a manual restart.</p>
<p>If you're still stuck, Next.js publishes an <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss">example app with Tailwind CSS</a> so you can see how your matches up.</p>
<p>One thing that may have noticed that may throw you off is that since this process creates a <code>postcss.config.js</code> file, it <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config">completely overwrites the implicit defaults used by Next.js</a>. On first glance, the defaults have a lot of stuff in it like <code>postcss-flexbox-fixes</code> and <code>postcss-preset-env</code> along with some configuration that we seem to have ignored. This is intentional.</p>
<p>Since by and large you won't be using CSS directly but will be using Tailwind CSS utility classes, you don't need that stuff and can just use the minimal <code>postcss.config.js</code> config from above.</p>
<h2>2. Add Tailwind UI</h2>
<p>The newest version of TailwindCSS and TailwindUI doesn't specifically require you to install TailwindUI-specific packages until you encounter that requirement by a particular TailwindUI component. For example, if you encounter a component that requires the <code>@tailwindcss/forms</code> plugin, you'll need to install it in your project with a <code>npm install --save @tailwindcss/forms</code> before you can use it.</p>
<p>There are some general and React-specific tips and tricks in the <a href="https://tailwindui.com/documentation">TailwindUI documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If things don't seem to be working and you've installed a new package or updated your <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file, you may need to stop and restart the Next.js dev server for it to pick up the changes.</p>
<p>If you are going to use the recommended <code>Inter var</code> font <a href="https://tailwindui.com/documentation#optional-add-the-inter-font-family">recommended by the TailwindUI documentation</a>, you'll need to put the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag that it suggests in the <code>index.js</code> file <code>&lt;Head&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<pre><code>...
&lt;Head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Next.js TailwindCSS&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rsms.me/inter/inter.css" /&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
...
</code></pre>
<p>To test that Tailwind UI is working properly, in <code>pages/index.js</code>, copy and paste in an element that does not have any Javascript (e.g., the Marketing Blog Section component).</p>
<p>You may need find-and-replace the <code>class</code> attribute to <code>className</code> if your IDE doesn't do this for your automatically.</p>
<p>That's it! Integrating TailwindUI with Next.js has gotten much simpler since TailwindCSS 2.0 arrived on the scene.</p></div></div></div>]]>

December 9, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/generating-realtime-weather-data-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In this short tutorial, you will learn to obtain the realtime/current weather conditions of any city in python. We are going to make use of the weather API from <a href="https://www.weatherapi.com/" target="_blank"><span>www.weatherapi.com</span></a>.</p>

<p>WeatherAPI is a service that provides weather data, including realtime weather data, forecasts, and historical data to developers for use in applications and other services.</p>

<p>Before using their API, you have to signup for a free account and generate an API key. You will need the API key for accessing their service.</p>

<p>We will use the Python Requests module for accessing the API. If you are not familiar with Requests, checkout Introduction to <a href="https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/making-requests-python-requests-library/">Python's Requests library</a>.</p>

<p>Install the requests module by running:</p>

<pre><code>pip install requests</code></pre>



<h2>Retrieving the Current weather data</h2>

<p>Before we make the request, first we will create these variables:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><code>base_url </code>, which stores the API's URL which is <span>http://api.weatherapi.com/v1.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>api_key</code>, stores your API key</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>city</code>, the city whose weather data is needed.</p>
	</li>
</ol>



<pre><code>import requests

api_key = "your_API_key"
base_url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
city = "london"

parameters = {"key":api_key, "q":city}         # URL parameters
r = requests.get(f"{base_url}/current.json", params=parameters)

data = r.json()         # retrieve the json data

print(data)</code></pre>

<p><strong>output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>{'location': {'name': 'London', 'region': 'City of London, Greater London', 'country': 'United
Kingdom', 'lat': 51.52, 'lon': -0.11, 'tz_id': 'Europe/London', 'localtime_epoch': 1606304125,
'localtime': '2020-11-25 11:35'}, 'current': {'last_updated_epoch': 1606302905, 'last_updated': 
2020-11-25 11:15', 'temp_c': 13.0, 'temp_f': 55.4, 'is_day': 1, 'condition': {'text': 'Partly
cloudy', 'icon': '//cdn.weatherapi.com/weather/64x64/day/116.png', 'code': 1003}, 'wind_mph': 8.1,
'wind_kph': 13.0, 'wind_degree': 200, 'wind_dir': 'SSW', 'pressure_mb': 1011.0, 'pressure_in': 30.3,
'precip_mm': 0.1, 'precip_in': 0.0, 'humidity': 82, 'cloud': 75, 'feelslike_c': 11.9, 'feelslike_f':
53.5, 'vis_km': 10.0, 'vis_miles': 6.0, 'uv': 3.0, 'gust_mph': 11.9, 'gust_kph': 19.1}}</code></pre>

<p>The output is a python dictionary therefore, we can easily get the data we want from it by indexing.</p>

<p>Now let's parse this data into a nice piece of information</p>

<pre><code>import requests

api_key = "your_API_key"
base_url = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1"
city = "london"

parameters = {"key":api_key, "q":city}         # URL parameters
r = requests.get(f"{base_url}/current.json", params=parameters)

data = r.json()         # retrieve json


# retriving Data

location = data['location']['name']
time = data['location']['localtime']

condition = data['current']['condition']['text']     
temperature_celcius = data['current']['temp_c']
temperature_farenheit = data['current']['temp_f']
feelslike_celcius = data['current']['feelslike_c']
wind_direction = data['current']['wind_dir']


# printing data
print(f"Location: {location}")
print(f"Current Time: {time}")
print()
print(f"Weather Condition: {condition}")
print(f"Temperature in Celcius: {temperature_celcius}")
print(f"Temperature in farenheit: {temperature_farenheit}")
print()
print(f"Temperature feels like: {feelslike_celcius} Celcius")
print(f"Wind Direction: {wind_direction}")</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Location: London
Current Time: 2020-11-25 11:53

Weather Condition: Light rain
Temperature in Celcius: 14.0
Temperature in farenheit: 57.2

Temperature feels like: 13.1 Celcius
Wind Direction: SSW
</code></pre>

                <p>Today, we were informed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that the agency has been subject to a cyber attack and that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, which has been stored on an EMA server, had been unlawfully accessed. It is important to note that no BioNTech or Pfizer systems have been breached in connection with this incident and we are unaware that any study participants have been identified through the data being accessed. At this time, we await further information about EMA’s investigation and will respond appropriately and in accordance with EU law. EMA has assured us that the cyber attack will have no impact on the timeline for its review.</p>

<p>Given the critical public health considerations and the importance of transparency, we continue to provide clarity around all aspects of the vaccine development and regulatory processes.

December 9, 2020 | https://blog.harterrt.com/cascading_metrics.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.harterrt.com/cascading_metrics.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It's surprisingly hard to lead a company with data.
There's a lot written about how to set good goals
and how to avoid common pitfalls (like <a href="https://blog.harterrt.com/surrogation.html">Surrogation</a>)
but I haven't seen much written about the practicalities
of taking action on these metrics.</p>
<p>I spent most of this year working with our executive team
to understand our corporate goals
and to track our progress against these goals.
I found that setting rock-solid goals <strong>didn't do much good
if individual employees didn't know how they could contribute</strong>.</p>
<p>The big and ambitious goals we set for our company as a whole
can be overwhelming to a single employee.
It's hard to know where to start,
so instead, overwhelmed employees
go back to whatever they were working on before.
<strong>We have to do more</strong> if we want to create behavior change
and get everyone working toward the same goal.</p>
<p>This article <strong>introduces a new framework</strong> for breaking down corporate goals
into metrics that are relevant and tractable for individual teams.
I call it <strong>Cascading Metrics</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start with a case study to illustrate.</p>
<h2>An Example: 2020 Firefox Goals</h2>
<p>Firefox is losing users. We have been for a while.
Obviously, we want to turn this around.
We started by setting a goal for 2020:
Slow the loss of Firefox users.</p>
<p>This is vague,
so we decided on a metric to track our progress
and set targets that we wanted to hit by the end of the year.
Specifically, at the end of the year we want to have 238 million
<a href="https://data.firefox.com/dashboard/user-activity">Monthly Active Users (MAU)</a>.</p>
<p>That's a good start.
By specifying a metric and a target we've made the goal 
specific, measurable, and time-bound.
Slowing the loss of Firefox users is obviously relevant.
In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART framework</a>
we're almost there.
The only <strong>remaining question is whether this goal is attainable</strong>.</p>
<p>Increasing MAU is a <em>huge</em> undertaking.
It's unwieldy.
It's hard to decide where to start on such a massive project.
To make this simpler, our leadership set a strategy to narrow the scope.
The team decided we're going to improve MAU
by finding a way to keep our new users around longer.</p>
<p>New Firefox users are at high risk of
installing Firefox and never returning again.
We decided to track this goal by measuring 
<a href="https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/cookbooks/retention.html">New User 1-Week Retention</a>.
At a high level, this metric measures:
of the people using Firefox for the first time today,
what portion use Firefox again next week?
Currently, it sits around 45-50%,
meaning a little more than half of new users don't return in the following week.</p>
<p>This is a more manageable goal.
Increasing retention is still a big undertaking,
but we have narrowed the scope a bit.</p>
<h2>Leading vs Lagging Metrics</h2>
<p>We have two metrics in this case study, MAU and Retention.
I'd call Retention a <strong>leading</strong> metric
and MAU a <strong>lagging</strong> metric.</p>
<p>Our main goal is to improve MAU,
but to make the goal more manageable 
we focused our strategy on improving retention.
Our hope is that improving retention will, in-turn, improve MAU.</p>
<p>I've seen this concept of leading and lagging metrics
discussed pretty often in leadership literature,
so I won't go too deep into it here <sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>The important point is that this is a <strong>very powerful pattern</strong>.
In the ideal case, 
employees can see consistent progress against our leading metric.
That's encouraging!
If we fail to set good leading metrics,
employees can get discouraged trying to make progress
against a metric that just won't budge.</p>
<p>I came across a particularly elegant explanation of this pattern in 
a Steinbeck novel (of all places):</p>
<!-- 
> In human affairs of danger and delicacy 
> successful conclusion is sharply limited by hurry.
-->

<blockquote>
<p>So often men trip by being in a rush.
If one were properly to perform a difficult and subtle act,
he should first inspect the end to be achieved and then,
once he had accepted the end as desirable,
he should forget it completely and concentrate soley on the means.
By this method he would not be moved to false action
by anxiety or hurry or fear.
Very few people learn this.</p>
<p>- John Steinbeck, East of Eden
<!-- First paragraph of chapter 21 --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, our lagging metric would describe the "end"
and our leading metric the "means".
Put another way: plan the work, then work the plan.</p>
<!--
Here's a quick summary of leading and lagging metrics:

<center><img width="75%" src="/images/cascading_metrics_leadvlag.svg"></center>
-->

<h2>Cascading Metrics</h2>
<p>There's a plot hole in this story though.
Increasing retention is still a very difficult goal to achieve.
<!--
This reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_of_Croton">Milo</a>
who carried a calf on his back every day until he could lift a bull
4 years later!
The thing is, a 3 month calf already weights ~250#
-->
A individual team <em>might</em> be able to improve Firefox retention,
but most won't be able to.
Our leading metric didn't do enough to make our lagging metric tractable.</p>
<p>This is where Cascading Metrics can help.
When creating cascading metrics, we repeatedly apply this pattern of
breaking down difficult to move metrics into easier to move metrics
until we have an appropriately-sized project for an individual team.
Let's look at an example:</p>
<p>Let's say Alice is a senior leader at Firefox 
and is responsible for improving MAU.
Alice identifies retention as the leading metric she wants to focus on improving.
Alice can then delegate responsibility for improving retention to Bob.
So far, nothing's changed.</p>
<p>Now Bob has the goal of improving retention.
He thinks that new users will be more likely to keep using Firefox
if we make the browser faster.
Accordingly, he identifies a leading metric to measure
how quickly Firefox loads websites on average.</p>
<p>In this example, Alice's leading metric becomes Bob's lagging metric.
This pattern can continue as needed until we have an achievable goal
and our strategy has become a tactic.</p>
<p>Here's a visual of what this flow might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.harterrt.com/images/cascading_metrics_example.svg"></p>
<p>At each level of delegation,
there's a chance to <strong>match an employee's responsibility with their influence</strong>.
For example, increasing MAU might be a fine goal for a C-Suite executive,
but it would be an unachievable goal for a single manager with only a few reports.
Similarly, an executive shouldn't be setting goals for individual teams.</p>
<h2>Developing Leading Metrics</h2>
<p>Something I really like about this framework is that
it's explicit about where these leading metrics come from.
The leading metrics <strong>describe a product strategy</strong>.</p>
<p>We've looked at a goal, thought deeply about the product,
and decided on a strategy that will help us achieve that goal.
This decision-making process should be informed by data,
but it's probably not <em>driven</em> by data.
It's <strong>driven by product intuition</strong>.</p>
<p>A very common failure case is to skip over the "strategy" part of this process
and hope our leading metric will just fall out of the data.
We focus on finding analytical solutions for increasing our metric.
Maybe we run some broad machine learning exploration to identify a leading metric.</p>
<p>These approaches are only occasionally successful.
More often than not, we end up finding obvious truths:
"Users who use the product frequently retain better!
We should get people to use the product more!".
If we do find a meaningful way to move our lagging metric,
it's very often something we don't have agency to change,
which limits its value as a leading metric.</p>
<p>We're almost always better off 
if we lean on our product experts to lead the way.
They can combine all of the tools at our disposal to find a way forward:
data science, user research, and their own product intuition.</p>
<p>Data science can support product in a couple of ways.
In the early stages of developing a strategy,
data science can help with opportunity sizing
and helping product test their intuition against the data
(e.g. do we have enough users in Germany
to focus all of our efforts in one country?)
Later in the process, data can help product
develop a leading metric to describe their strategy.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Setting numeric goals is a great way to give a company direction.
However, these ambitious corporate goals often
fail to create any real behavior change in practice.
If we want people to change their behavior
we have to make our goals relevant to individual teams.
Cascading metrics gives us a framework for turning our big corporate goals
into something relevant to front-line engineers.</p>

December 9, 2020 | https://singhkays.com/blog/arm-cpu-faster-than-apple-m1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://singhkays.com/blog/arm-cpu-faster-than-apple-m1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The release of Apple M1 Silicon has laid to rest many questions about whether ARM CPUs can go toe-to-toe with the best of the bunch from Intel and AMD. The question now is not whether ARM chips can perform better than Intel/AMD but whether others can build similarly powerful ARM CPUs. Today, companies like Marvell, Ampere and AWS are shipping ARM CPUs that keep getting better with each generation and close to the level of performance of top-end X86 CPUs. It only feels like a matter of time before ARM CPUs will provide tough competition to the X86 CPUs from Intel and AMD. This feels a bit like standing on the Florida coast and watching the first bands of a hurricane arrive. This reminds me of the iconic scene in the movie “The Dark Knight Rises” when Selina Kyle (<em>Catwoman</em>) tells Bruce Wayne (<em>Batman</em>) that there’s a storm (<em>Bane</em>) coming. The full dialogue goes something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selina Kyle (Catwoman): There’s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits, you’re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us.</p>
<p><em>—The Dark Knight Rises (2012)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you read between the lines, there are many parallels that you can draw from the characterization in the movie to real life.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Batman and Catwoman are frenemies, which is not much different from Intel and AMD’s relationship. They are often competitors, just like Batman &amp; Catwoman. Still, they managed to work together once and ship this baby - <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/130409/intel-core-i7-8809g-processor-with-radeon-rx-vega-m-gh-graphics-8m-cache-up-to-4-20-ghz.html">Intel® Core i7-8809G</a> - a rare Intel CPU with AMD integrated graphics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intel has dominated a large part of the CPU market’s profits for a very long time. In contrast, everyone else has had to contend with using lower cost as a vector to compete against Intel’s hegemony. For e.g. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/02/05/amd-gained-share-against-intel-in-x86-processor-market-in-q4/">Intel dominates about 95.5% of the server chip market</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(<em>SPOILER ALERT</em>)</strong> Selina ends up joining up with Bane by giving up Batman. This might be very similar to the rumors that AMD is planning its own ARM CPUs in real life.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AMD has an M1 competitor in prototype stages, one version with integrated RAM, and one without it<br>he said "almost ready"<br>but -imo- idk<br>leak is only a few days old, the chip idk</p>— Mauri QHD (@MauriQHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MauriQHD/status/1332601734565416962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

</li>
</ol>

<p>Apple Silicon M1 has taken the CPU market by storm and, in doing so, answered every doubt whether it can compete with the best of the best. The M1 is currently sitting at the top of Geekbench’s <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">single-core throne</a>, all while using less power than competing CPUs. The M1 has completely reset the Performance per Watt expectations. It’s even more astonishing to think that as Apple has introduced the M1 for only the lowest-end Macs, this is the slowest SoC that Apple will ever make (<em>for Macs</em>). Based on Apple’s history of consistently delivering year-over-year performance improvements, the follow-ups to the M1 will likely improve upon the current single-core performance very rapidly. It is not clear whether Intel and AMD have something in the pipeline that could shift the balance back in X86’s favor.</p>

<p><strong>Nuvia</strong> is a startup founded in early 2019 that is building an ARM CPU for the server market. The company was founded by John Bruno, Manu Gulati, and Gerard Williams III. They bring a breadth of experience in system engineering and silicon design for more than 20 chips and more than 100 patents. Nuvia’s leadership team holds an impressive resume with various architect and leadership roles at Google, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, and AMD (<a href="https://nuviainc.com/leadership"><em>See here for the leadership team’s full details</em></a>). It is quite possible that Nuvia’s leadership was involved with the previous Apple Silicon designs and bring with them the ideas and strategies that have made Apple’s chips a market-leader.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://medium.com/silicon-reimagined/performance-delivered-a-new-way-8f0f5ed283d5">more on Nuvia’s design goals and philosophy</a> (<em><strong>emphasis</strong> on key talking points mine</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our focus at NUVIA is to develop an SoC that will deliver industry-leading performance with the highest levels of efficiency, at the same time. To do this, <strong>we are creating a server CPU that is built in a new way, with a complete overhaul of the CPU pipeline</strong>. Our first-generation CPU, code-named “<strong>Phoenix</strong>” will be a custom core based on the ARM architecture and central to our “<strong>Orion</strong>” SoC.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With X86 solutions claiming most of the market, only a small percentage of niche customers are willing to accept a lower per-core performance, high core count product. Arguably the most successful ARM-based design today is Amazon’s Graviton. Graviton is a captive design, aimed solely for a limited portion of AWS that values cost over performance. While there will likely be additional growth in this area, <strong>the heart of the market clearly demands the highest single-thread performance at TDP and the highest all-core performance at TDP</strong>. This is the fastest way to improve Performance/TCO for the most demanding hyperscale customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>While these new entrant’s products show improvements, they still fall short of disrupting their X86 incumbents. At NUVIA, we are taking a different approach, with a clean-sheet CPU design that will deliver an elegant balance of performance leadership and power efficiency that maximizes memory bandwidth and core utilization. <strong>Our solution does not need to add extraneous cores to try and make up for a single-threaded performance deficit</strong>. Also, there would be <strong>no need to employ marketing-inflated boost clocks</strong> that are not achievable in any real-world applications of server SoCs, due to running into TDP constraints. In real-world scenarios, server SoCs are designed to be heavily loaded to make the best use of the capitalized hardware and allocated power and cooling budgets. The optimal solution is one where a workload finishes in the shortest time possible while consuming the least possible power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve highlighted the key design goals, but the gist of it is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nuvia is likely working on a custom ARM design like Apple rather than reusing ARM’s reference architecture like some other ARM licensees.</li>
<li>The goal is the highest single-thread performance possible without the use of boost or turbo clocks.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nuvia recently <a href="https://medium.com/silicon-reimagined/performance-delivered-a-new-way-8f0f5ed283d5">published their findings</a> on how their Phoenix CPU fares against the latest X86 and ARM CPUs. Here are the systems that were tested:</p>

<p>The reasons for choosing these CPUs were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The devices tested demonstrate the current state of the art from the majority of the major players, both ARM and X86 based platforms. Intel’s Core i7–1068NG7 Ice Lake based SoC is the highest performance variant currently available utilizing the new Sunny Cove CPU microarchitecture, based on Intel’s 10nm process node. We are also assuming that Intel’s next-generation Ice Lake Server will utilize a CPU core built upon a similar base architecture as Sunny Cove. The Intel Core i7–8750H is the last generation of the Skylake microarchitecture and is more closely related to the CPU core shipping in today’s latest Xeon processors. AMD’s Ryzen 4700U utilizes the latest Zen 2 CPU core on TSMC’s 7nm process node. AMD uses the same Zen 2 CPU core within the CCX chiplet in the Rome EPYC family of processors. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 utilizes ARM’s latest A77 as its performance core and is implemented on TSMC’s 7nm process node. The latest announced Ampere Altra and Amazon Graviton 2 both use an ARM N1 CPU core that is more closely related to the older A76, and both are built upon TSMC’s 7nm process node. Lastly, the Apple A13 and A12Z demonstrate the current fastest ARM-based processors, also both built upon TSMC’s 7nm process node.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nuvia released the expected single-core Performance-Per-Watt curve of their upcoming CPU. To get an idea of how this ranks against the M1, I’ve added the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/5197838">single-core Geekbench score for M1 based Mac Mini</a> to Nuvia’s graph. Nuvia is not disclosing the actual score, just giving estimates for now. The actual scores will be released at a later date. My best estimate based on their current projections is that these are higher than Apple M1’s single-core score. Based on the posted graph, I would put the single-core score between <strong>1900</strong> to <strong>2250</strong> range which is about a <strong>10-30%</strong> improvement on single-core performance.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-read-these-results">How to read these results?</h3>
<p>From Nuvia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When measured against current products available in-market in the 1W-4.5W power envelope (<em>per core</em>), the Phoenix CPU core performs up to 2X faster than the competition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2X claim should now change since the results were published in August before the Apple M1 and the Zen 3 launch. These products now have higher single-core performance than the products Nuvia tested.</p>
<p>Nuvia did, however, expect such a scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We realize the companies we have measured against in these tests are not standing still and will have new products in the market over the next 18 months. That said, we believe that even with significant performance gains (20%+) with new CPU architectures, we will continue to hold a clear position of leadership in performance-per-watt.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-is-nuvia-focusing-on-this-1w-45w-per-core-power-envelope">Why is Nuvia focusing on this 1W-4.5W per core power envelope?</h3>
<p>I’ll let Nuvia answer this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All current and future flagship server SoCs are power constrained, very much like mobile SoCs. As core count increases, what is not increasing is the TDP. TDPs are likely going to remain in the 250W — 300W …</p></blockquote></div></div>

  				 <p>December 2020</p>

<p>If your product moves money on behalf of customers, and you manage the ledger, you need reconciliation. You can think of recon as the process of making sure every transaction in your system matches one in the external world. For every dollar you’ve moved, an external entity agrees with the amount and direction, and has provided “documentation” to that effect.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few performant recon systems that came under stress as they scaled, and I’ve worked with startups at early enough stages that getting recon right was not existential. I’ve also never built a recon system from scratch. Everything I'll say here is from the perspective of a user of recon systems rather than a maker of them. I’ve been a customer of a couple, and their performance impacted my output so I have strong opinions about what I wish would exist. Since I'm not sure what a perfect recon system would look like, I'm writing this to flesh out the thought, and to smoke out anyone who already knows.</p>
<p>I’ve interacted with reconciliation systems aimed at two types of problems:</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of transactions</h2>
<p>Transaction oriented recon makes sure that some external party agrees with every money movement in your ledger. I saw this philosophy in the recon systems I interacted with at Cash App &amp; Square in general. In this model, the objective is to make sure that every money movement action matches your intention. This means the state of the transaction, the direction, and the amount are what you expect. A secondary objective is ensuring the timing matches your intention. This is secondary because in a lot of cases, the actual precise timing doesn't matter as long as it happens&nbsp; "soon", and as long as the underlying accounts aren’t run at a $0 balance. In this case reconciliation solves an accounting problem, ensuring money movements are correct. It also helps ensure that the company's receivables and payables are complete, is useful for regulatory &amp; financial audits, and empowers your treasury team to make good cash management decisions. I suspect most acquirers (Stripe, Square, Adyen, etc.) at least start by pursuing transaction oriented recon.</p>
<p>Typically in an acquiring world, you construct the “internal” ledger from the settlement/capture messages generated by the card networks. This is what product teams look at to inform customer facing features. You construct the “external” ledger from settlement files generated by the acquiring bank. Accounting teams look at the external ledger (technically accounting teams look at both ledgers, but product teams rarely look at the external ledger on an ongoing basis).</p>
<p>A recon system often includes an engineering team paired with an operations team, working together. In cases where the internal and external ledgers disagree, a human (on the ops team) reviews the data. They determine what’s causing the exception, whether it's systematic, how frequently it occurs, and what to do to fix it. The eng team continually optimizes the process to reduce the exception rate over time. Transaction oriented recon primarily solves accounting problems. You’re typically working towards SLAs designed for monthly/quarterly earnings close, and your outputs feed into income/cash flow statements.</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of balances</h2>
<p>Balance oriented recon ensures precise amounts in bank or customer accounts on a periodic basis. You use the same internal and external ledgers as in transaction oriented recon. However, you're comparing not only the amounts, state and direction of a transaction, but also its timing. This type of recon system can be useful for accounting, but is ideal for building systems that report a balance at a point in time. One example is a banking system of record. In the case of a system of record, a balance oriented recon system informs customer-facing balances and FDIC insurance.</p>
<p>Balance oriented recon systems are required for organizations that issue instruments and are the final source of truth for their own ledger. Most financial technology companies today rely on the ledgers managed by their infrastructure providers. For instance, if you issue cards, the banking as a service platform typically connects to the bank’s core, and most traditional bank cores have a balance oriented recon framework built in.</p>
<p>For context - in order to provide FDIC insurance to customers, banks are required to provide an auditable record of customer balances at any point in time. This is usually solved by being able to provide a daily snapshot of customer balances. This function is one of several provided by core processors, and as a result most core processors have a balance oriented recon process built in by default.</p>
<p>However if you’re the rare card issuer managing your own ledger (or really building any kind of financial product where you’re responsible for your own ledger, such as a digital wallet where you own the money transmission licenses), you’ll need to build a balance oriented recon system eventually. It's the way you’ll be sure you have the money that you’re telling customers you have.</p>
<h2>Common Problems in Recon</h2>
<h3>Adding a new money movement type to a single balance</h3>
<p>One overarching problem that affects all recon systems is what happens when new types of money movement impact a balance. For instance, imagine you run a digital wallet where your primary funding and cash-out transaction types are ACH debits and credits. Also, imagine you’ve built a perfect reconciliation system, with the combination of technology and human process that allows you to tie out balances and payments with zero failures (this is super unlikely). The moment you add payment cards as funding/cash out instruments, you now have a different external ledger to integrate with. It will have different edges than you're used to. You'll deal with potentially different organizations, who have different processes for resolving exceptions. No matter what you do, this will take time to get right, and long after your new feature is launched, you’ll probably discover new, undocumented quirks. Some of these quirks will only be clear when you’re processing money movements at scale. I’ve seen cases where the incorrect MID set with a card network resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars routed to the wrong (internal) account. Survivable error as the transactions were reconciled in aggregate, but bad for accounting and distraction caused to cross functional team members pulled in to swarm the problem.</p>
<h3>Timing differences between authorization and settlement</h3>
<p>For balance oriented reconciliation systems in particular, solving timing problems is critical. Timing problems typically occur when a) the payment authorization time and the settlement time are different, and your system’s not necessarily aware, b) you’re dealing with payment types where the settlement amount can be adjusted multiple times c) your ledger updates customers balances when a new payment authorization comes in, rather than a settlement message. In all these cases you’re grappling with a few questions (I don’t actually know the right answers to these):</p>
<ul>
<li>When should you update a customer’s balance? When you know there is a transaction (when the auth comes in) or when amount is finalized (when the settlement comes in)</li>
<li>When the authorization and settlement amounts are different, do you retroactively adjust the balance for the day the authorization came in? Or do you fix that in place and only adjust the balance with the delta on the day the settlement arrives?</li>
<li>Is your snapshot on a particular day immutable (i.e. it can never be adjusted) and if so, how do you handle changes in amounts between the authorization and the settlement?</li>
<li>Traditional core systems will have an available balance (which is how much you can access, with pending transaction amounts removed), and an account balance (which includes pending transactions, and is typically higher than the available balance).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relying on aged systems for exception handling</h3>
<p>Very often you work with a wholesale bank whose systems are seasoned and handle the majority of exceptions using manual workflows. This can be frustrating; you’re faced with either adopting their manual processes, which bind your cost structure to theirs, or accepting a higher exception rate temporarily while you build technical systems around their process. There’s no easy trade-off here.</p>
<h3>Early prototyping and float problems</h3>
<p>In the course of product development you’ll often prototype by adding new money movement types to your ledger. A lot of these prototypes (as should happen) will be discarded. Despite this, they will have moved real money and affected your real ledger, and (at least for your accounting team's sanity) you’ll need a stateful way to reconcile the money that moved to your ledger. While at Cash I once spent a year integrating into 6 card issuer processor systems while prototyping the Cash Card. With each integration we needed a float (depositing funds with the card issuer so we could test transactions in the real world) which meant our accounting team now had 6 new banking relationships to monitor, 4 of which lasted less than 6 months, but all of which required material floats amounts. In a few cases, the issuer processor didn’t actually enable us to manage our own ledger, so we’d have a parallel ledger (one on our databases and a mirror on theirs) that we’d have to keep in sync. There was at least one integration that we ultimately discarded, which took us several months to reconcile, long after we’d walked away from the partnership. How you handle these cases will depend on what’s financially “material” for your organization. In our cases, prototype floats were all sub $100k, so survivable at our scale. But tracking these down repeatedly was an insane level of tedium.</p>
<h3>Managing ledgers across many internal bank accounts</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll contract with multiple banks for different financial services. For instance one bank for merchant acquiring and another for …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Lesson 1: Even if the role doesn’t involve coding, you may have to prove you can code.</strong> Half of the companies I interviewed with put me through a coding challenge of some sort, even though the role is management and team building. Companies want to make sure you can understand what your team is talking about and maybe help out during crunch time. </p>



<p>My advice for those challenges is:</p>



<ol><li>Add a lot of debug output and run your code often. Interviewers seem to love that.</li><li>Talk your way through everything that you do, and feel free to Google as needed.</li><li>You want a quick and dirty solution, not a beautiful one. Aim for the crappiest thing that works, and then ask if there’s value in <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/08/2-things-ive-learned-from-reading-refactoring-by-martin-fowler/">cleaning it up</a>. Usually they’ll say no.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Lesson 2: It’s a numbers game.</strong> I applied to about 20 places and only ended up getting interviews with 4. I got offers from 2 of those so my offer-to-application ratio is 1 in 10. I ended up accepting an offer from a company that I almost didn’t bother applying to. They won me over during the interview process. So apply anywhere and everywhere, because you never know which company may surprise you.</p>



<p><strong>Lesson 3: Start with the ones you don’t care about.</strong> Your first few interviews may be rough, especially if you <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/22/interviewing-just-because/">haven’t done it in a while</a>. Make sure to get those out of the way with companies that you don’t have your heart set on. That way you’ll have rehearsed answers to common questions and you’ll be free of the nerves by the time you get to the companies you want.</p>



<p><strong>Lesson 4: Remember it’s an interview. </strong>This is one of the rare situations where <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/05/respond-to-vulnerability-with-vulnerability/">vulnerability</a> and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/23/death-to-small-talk/">being 100% authentic</a> can get you into trouble. I had a couple interviews where I was a little too relaxed and treated it like a casual conversation. The point of an interview is for a company and a perspective employee to sell themselves to each other, not to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">build a strong relationship</a> with your interviewer. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/10/death-to-just-add-water-team-jelling/">My habits</a>, which help me in <a href="https://critter.blog/2016/10/27/the-whys-and-hows-of-jelling-teams/">building teams</a>, failed me in interviewing.</p>



<p><strong>Lesson 5: Read a few good leadership books.</strong> You want them to be fresh in your mind when you interview. I am not sure if I would have gotten the offer I accepted if not for the ideas I stole from <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/13/be-the-trampoline/">The Culture Code</a>, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">The Effective Manager</a>, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">Extreme Ownership</a>, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/25/if-you-want-to-be-heard-listen/">Difficult Conversations</a>, and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">Dare To Lead</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Lesson 6: Always ask these two specific questions</strong>:</p>



<ol><li>“<em>What is the worst thing about working at Company XYZ?</em>” People are surprisingly willing to be honest here. I got some enlightening answers about <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/15/the-hero-culture-conundrum/">hero culture</a>, lack of senior engineers, and corporate red tape.</li><li>“<em>What, if anything, concerns you about whether I’m a good fit for this role?</em>” Only 2 or 3 people said “nothing” to that question. Everyone else had something to say. Sometimes I was able to clarify a misconception they had about my experience, and sometimes it was a <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/11/good-feedback-is-pokey/">fair and justified concern</a>. Either way, that’s valuable.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Lesson 7: Negotiate your salary! </strong>Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step/dp/0692568689?sa-no-redirect=1&amp;pldnSite=1">Fearless Salary Negotiation</a> and follow the steps it describes. It’s not hard when you know what you’re doing. When I average it out, I made about $1,000 per minute that I spent reading that book. </p>

<p>Welcome to CellSol!</p>
<p>This website and its associated project are now in beta! Come take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/RbtsEvrwhr-Riley/CellSol/">GitHub</a></p>

<p>What if the internet and cell phone towers went down for more than a few hours - or during an emergency situation? No communication could lead to lost lives.</p>

<p>The end goal of the project is to have a widespread network able to handle low-bandwidth traffic (text, compressed images) for a large number of users, to fill gaps when the larger Internet is unavailable.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency, the CellSol network, much like the Internet, can be used as a knowledge base, as well as a rally point, giving people a tool to use to coordinate and organize even if 
other communication systems go down. We intend to scale the design, with long-haul routing capabilities, so that regional networks can intercommunicate and interoperate, allowing for a wider breadth of use cases.</p>

<p>The overall design is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">mesh network</a> of <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora">LoRa</a> devices, called “Pylons”
that act as repeaters (extending the range of the network). Terminals (devices that users access the network with) also repeat packets, so that a network
made up entirely of end users is possible.</p>
<p>The two basic types of pylons are the ESP32 WiFi Pylon (a terminal device) and the Ardunio Repeater Pylon (a pure repeater, but can have bluetooth to use as a terminal).</p>
<p>Pylons with more specialized uses, such as data repositories for local emergency resources (phone numbers, shelter locations, etc.) and knowledge bases (such as a Wikipedia mirror) are also intended to be
developed in the future, to add to the overall usefulness of the network.</p>

<p>Rumors of Tesla &amp; SpaceX CEO and the world’s 3rd richest person Elon Musk’s relocation to Texas have been confirmed by none other than by himself. Talking to WSJ Editor-in-Chief Matt Murray he briefly explained the reasons behind this move.</p>



<figure>
<amp-iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://video-api.wsj.com/api-video/player/v3/iframe.html?guid=C3E518A1-7C4F-4C3A-9E87-F759847D0D44" height="400" layout="fixed-height" width="auto" sandbox="allow-downloads allow-forms allow-modals allow-orientation-lock allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" i-amphtml-layout="fixed-height"><span placeholder=""></span></amp-iframe>
<figcaption>Full interview video below.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>In the meantime, Elon Musk posted a tweet that signaled his farewell to Silicon Valley, he also thanked for all of the success he had garnered here over the years.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“So long, and thanks for the orifice!” – Alien message decrypted.</p><cite>Elon Musk on <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1336351038106869760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a></cite></blockquote></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://evannex.com/?ref=Iqtidar_TeslaOracle_EVANNEX_Banner" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzI1MCcgd2lkdGg9JzMwMCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></a><figcaption>– Sponsored –</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Musk’s discontent with the policies of the government of California, especially the Alameda County became clear in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/05/10/tesla-sued-alameda-return-to-work-playbook/">Tesla even sued Alameda County</a> at the time for not letting the factory re-open with the extensive employee safety SOPs in place.</p>



<p>Elon Musk has also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/amydobson/2020/11/06/elon-musk-makes-headway-in-quest-to-sell-all-his-homes/?sh=e6fd5b2be373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> several of his homes in Los Angeles including the house of late actor Gene Wilder. Musk had a property portfolio worth more than $100 million in LA, some of these are still on sale.</p>



<p>According to his short interview with WSJ yesterday, he has two main objectives in moving to Texas. The development of Starship which is going on in Boca Chica, South Texas, and the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-austin/">next Tesla US Gigafactory</a> going under fast development in Austin, Texas (latest drone video below).</p>



<p>He also mentioned that his companies, Tesla and SpaceX has still major operations in California. Probably the Tesla / SpaceX HQ will remain in California for the foreseeable future but earlier this year <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/05/09/tesla-suing-alameda-fremont-move/">Elon threatened to move Tesla HQ to Texas</a> but the situation neutralized in the following weeks.</p>



<p>His move to Texas at this time also makes sense as <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> Starship and the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> which will be built at <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-austin/">Gigafactory Austin</a>, are the two most exciting and important projects for him right now. Tesla Model 3 and <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Model Y</a> production at the Fremont Factory California has streamlined for the most part and must have been a boring task for Musk.</p>



<p>The third important task on his to-do list as he explains in this interview is Gigafactory Berlin. He plans to regularly visit Germany and keep up with the development of this huge Tesla car manufacturing facility. </p>

<p>Just on this past weekend, he even <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/04/tesla-secures-giga-berlin-paint-shop-permit-musk-sleeps-at-the-factory/">slept at the under-construction Giga Berlin site</a>, to monitor the progress and give motivation to the engineers and workers. On an earlier visit to Giga Berlin, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/11/05/elon-musk-flies-to-germany-to-interview-giga-berlin-engineers-25-guns-himself/">he personally recruited and interviewed 25-guns (top engineers)</a> to tackle the problems at the site.</p>



<p>By moving to Texas, Elon Musk’s complaints of traffic jams from work to home and vice versa will also be relieved significantly. With the huge number of capital gains from his billion-dollar pay package from Tesla and selling off his properties, Texas is the right place to be with relaxed laws around State income tax and Capital-gains tax.</p>



<p>Hopefully, with <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>‘s move to Texas, the Starship and Cybertruck production plans will move more valiantly into their next phases.</p>

        <section>
            <p>When you start an email campaign, it’s important to be data-driven. An experimental mindset will help you understand if you’re going in the right direction or if there is something different you can test to improve your results. </p>

<p>In order to measure the success of your cold email campaigns, there are a few metrics that you should keep an eye on. In this blog post, we are going to focus on the three main metrics and provide tips to help you increase those metrics.</p>

<h3 id="1openrate">1. Open Rate 🔎</h3>

<p>The open rate measures the percentage of people that opened your email (total opens/emails sent). It’s the variable you need to measure to know if your subject line and the first sentence of your emails are working.</p>

<p>Here is a list of things to take into consideration to improve your open rates:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Have an accurate lead generation process</strong>. Make sure you are reaching out to the right person. You should send your emails to the purchasers, the decision-makers for your product/service.</li>
<li><strong>Discover the ideal time to send your emails</strong>. It’s important to find the best time to send your emails. It usually depends on several variables such as the type of companies you’re reaching out to, their location, the job titles of the prospects (CEOs vs Managers) etc. In general, Mondays are not the best days to send cold emails, people have a lot of catching up to do. Try to send them early in the morning or late in the afternoon. A/B test until you find the best time to send your email campaigns.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6dDAIKX.png" alt="alt"></p>

<p><em>Image: Distribution of the interested ratio per day of the week.</em></p>

<p><em>PS: Don’t feel discouraged by the lower ratio during weekends for example. With very well targeted campaigns, it’s possible to get prospects with high buying intent onboard when they are less busy.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Select a killer subject line</strong>. This is the key factor when it comes to the open rate. If you want your prospects to open your emails, you have to write a killer subject line. Keep it short, and avoid using spammy words. Check this blog post on how to write the best subject lines for a more effective cold email.</li>
<li><strong>Write a good first sentence of your email</strong>. The first things your prospects see are the subject line and part of the first sentence of your emails. Be concise and personal in the way you start your emails.</li>
<li><strong>Raise your game with follow-up emails</strong>. When you send your first email, it may slip through the cracks in a cluttered inbox. That’s why you should be persistent and use your follow-up emails to catch the prospects' attention. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/354FqSc.jpg" alt="alt"></p>

<p><em>Image: Cumulative percentage of interested email replies per stage of the campaign.</em></p>

<p><em>💡Note: With only one touch in your campaign you’re missing out 44% of all interested prospects in your product/service.</em></p>

<h3 id="2replyrate">2. Reply Rate 💬</h3>

<p>The reply rate gives you the percentage of people that replied to your email (total replies/emails sent). The most important factor is the body of your email. You should aim at a reply rate that is half of your open rate (i.e. if you have 70% open rate you should have a 35% reply rate).</p>

<p>Here is a list of things to take into consideration to improve your reply rates:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Write a short and concise email</strong>. People have short attention spans when it comes to emails. Keep your message short and clear to increase the chances of getting a reply.</li>
<li><strong>Personalize your approach as much as possible</strong>. Personalize your emails with the use of powerful dynamic fields such as first names, job titles, locations, etc. You can also mention news or recent achievements.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>💡Note: This can be the most time-consuming part of your cold emails, <a href="http://http//blog.amplemarket.com/personalization-at-scale/">learn here</a> how you can personalize your emails at scale!</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid features, add value propositions</strong>. When you craft your cold email campaigns, put yourself in your prospects’ shoes. Avoid enumerating your product’s features, and focus on presenting a solution to a pain point they might be struggling with.</li>
<li><strong>Add a clear call to action</strong>. The main goal of cold email outreach is to generate as many opportunities as possible. Be very clear with your ask and where you would like to take the conversation. Writing good calls to action is of utmost importance, you can learn more here: Learn here how to write catchy and clear calls to action. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3conversionrate">3. Conversion Rate 📈</h3>

<p>The conversion rate measures the percentage of people that converted to a given goal (i.e. scheduling a call, signing up for a free trial, clicking on a link, etc...). The main goal when sending cold emails is to turn cold leads into warm leads. You should aim at 10-20% of your reply rate. This is a good benchmark for conversion rates in cold email campaigns. It's a good number for a first call/demo, however if you’re offering a free trial maybe it should be even higher.</p>

<p>The conversion rates are a combination of everything mentioned above: Prospecting, Value Proposition, Personalization, Follow-ups, Subject line, Call to action, Reminders. In a nutshell, you need to make sure you have targeted campaigns, with relevant content and good calls to action.</p>

<h6 id="wrappingup">Wrapping up...</h6>

<p>In this blog post, we shared the 3 most important metrics that you should measure when sending cold emails: Open rate, Reply rate and Conversion rate. You should always A/B test every assumption, in order to guarantee the best results possible. Iterate a lot and learn and refine along the way!</p>

<p>At <a href="https://amplemarket.com/?ref=amplemarket-blog">Amplemarket</a>, we’ve helped several clients optimizing their cold email strategy over the years. We are constantly testing new hypotheses to see what works for cold emails.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask for advice when things aren’t going as you expected!</p>

        <div>
          <p>It is a really great time to be a developer.</p>

<p>We have tons of APIs integrated within great tools for building dynamic, full stack apps. If you are a developer, you probably are using technologies like schemaless data stores, serverless architectures, JSON APIs, and/or the GraphQL language.</p>

<p>Further, there are a bunch of cool frameworks like the <strong>Jam</strong>stack (<strong>J</strong>avaScript, <strong>A</strong>PIs, and <strong>M</strong>arkup) and services like Netlify to make it fast to deploy a serverless app.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time ever, Apache Cassandra is a part of this stack because <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/">Stargate is now live on Astra</a> as the official data API.</p>

<p>The modern apps we build need data APIs which integrate into our toolset and work with native data shapes (JSON, REST, GraphQL, etc). These data APIs need to support schemaless JSON, while simultaneously providing speed and scalability.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it better only take a few minutes for us to use them within our project.</p>

<p>DataStax built <a href="https://stargate.io/">Stargate</a> into Astra to give us, app developers, a natural data API stack which meshes with the Jamstack (or serverless stack of your choice). Stargate in Astra is built on the rock solid NoSQL data engine (Apache Cassandra) which powers Netflix, Instagram, Yelp, iCloud and other apps we all use everyday.</p>

<h2 id="what-exactly-is-stargate">What exactly is Stargate?</h2>
<p>Stargate is an <a href="https://stargate.io/2020/09/14/init-stargate.html">open source data gateway</a> that sits between your app server and your databases. Stargate brings together an API platform and data request coordination code into one OSS project.</p>

<p>Multiple successful app companies - like Netflix and Yelp - built their own data gateways to help internal app developers create features using simple APIs, without needing to learn the underlying database or mess with schema.</p>

<p>DataStax integrated Stargate into Astra to give you the same power and ease of access to your data.</p>

<p>What does this mean for you?</p>

<ul>
  <li>No upfront data modelling needed for Documents.</li>
  <li>Less custom code to maintain.</li>

<p>You can work with your data the way you want – JSON via schemaless document APIs or database schema aware GraphQL and RESTful APIs – while Stargate serves as the proxy that coordinates these requests to different flavors of Cassandra.</p>

<p>To see it in action, let’s see how this works by using JSON with Stargate’s schemaless Document API in a TikTok clone. Because, if Instagram and Snapchat have a TikTok clone, we should have one, too. Right?</p>

<h2 id="real-quick-note-first">Real Quick Note First</h2>

<p>Slinging JSON to and from Apache Cassandra without data modeling is just too much fun. You gotta <a href="http://astra.datastax.com/">try this out in Astra for yourself</a>. You can get <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api">hands on with it right away</a> or check out our <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery">sample app gallery</a> to see schemaless Cassandra in action.</p>

<p>We are stoked to have engineers from Netflix, Burberry, Macquarie Bank, USAA, and Yelp creating Stargate with us. They are already hard at work battletesting the APIs and collaborating on new features.</p>

<p>Ok, onto the code!</p>

<h2 id="posts-in-tiktok">Posts in TikTok</h2>

<p>We are going to walk through using Stargate’s APIs in Astra for creating and updating posts within a TikTok clone. We’re walking through examples that are ready to be pasted into your latest Jamstack app.</p>

<p>To use Stargate in Astra in your app, first install and set up our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrajs/collections">JavaScript SDK</a>. You can learn about storing environment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSmzEGZQI5A">variables in your .env file here</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a basic TikTok post: a video with a caption, like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>postId</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>video</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/FTBP02Y.mp4</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>caption</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>timestamp</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>2020-12-09T09:08:31.020Z</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>likes</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After connecting to Stargate in Astra with a nodejs client, let’s create a new collection in our app and add the post with:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>postsCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span>
  <span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>posts</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>postData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve ever used Cassandra before, you know this is amazing. Look at what we didn’t do: no data modeling, no table creation, no configuration code, no partition keys, no clustering columns. I think you get my drift.</p>

<p>Stargate in Astra allows you to add data to Apache Cassandra in one line of code.</p>

<p>This level of ease of use hasn’t previously been possible with Cassandra. Insert JSON and move on.</p>

<p>Next up, let’s say you want to find all posts about ducks. You can do that via:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find all posts about ducks</span>
<span>const</span> <span>posts</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>caption</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>{</span> <span>$in</span><span>:</span>  <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>ducks</span><span>"</span><span>]</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And boom. Now you have your ducks channel all set up for your users. Because who doesn’t want a stream fully dedicated to ducks?</p>

<p>Now, your app isn’t going to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-fleets-reactions-memes-edit-button-1548037">be like Twitter</a>. We can edit stuff here. Let’s show how to edit your post’s caption. Stories tho? That’s on you</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// update the post’s caption</span>
<span>const</span> <span>post</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>postsCollection</span><span>.</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>post</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>caption</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>These ducks are MEGA cute</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above was just a quick tour on how to do a few data API calls for a basic TikTok clone. Want to see the full thing? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IATOicvih5A">Ania Kubow</a>’s tutorial to see how to wire this up into a full React app with Netlify.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>For more examples, we have hands-on tutorials for using <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/rest">Stargate’s REST</a>, <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api">Document</a> and <a href="https://www.datastax.com/dev/graphql">GraphQL APIs</a>. Check ‘em out and let us know what you think.</p>

<p>Have an app idea or want to join the fun? <a href="https://discord.gg/2Xt8QNyFZA">You can join the Stargate community, too</a>.</p>

<p>We would love to see how you customize your TikTok clone to show off more ways to feature data in your app. Or, you can create your own non-TikTok example. We would love to showcase your example in our <a href="https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery">sample app gallery</a>, so tell us about it in <a href="https://discord.gg/33mKDHHFUE">our contribute channel</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-are-down-here-looking-for-a-few-more-details">So, you are down here looking for a few more details</h2>
<p>If you came down here, maybe you are looking for a few more lines of code.</p>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>Let’s show how to set up the node JS client and a few more data API calls. For starters, let’s take a look at how to set up your client to connect to Stargate in Astra.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// npm install @astrajs/collections</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>createClient</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>@astrajs/collections</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// create an Astra client</span>
<span>const</span> <span>astraClient</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>createClient</span><span>(</span>
<span>{</span>   <span>astraDatabaseId</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_ID</span><span>,</span>
    <span>astraDatabaseRegion</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_REGION</span><span>,</span>
    <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_USERNAME</span><span>,</span>
    <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>.</span><span>ASTRA_DB_PASSWORD</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Easy enough.</p>

<p>Then, let’s create a users collection in our database to store documents about our TikTok users:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create the users collection in the app</span>
<span>const</span> <span>usersCollection</span> <span>=</span> <span>astraClient</span><span>.</span><span>namespace</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>tikTokClone</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>collection</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>users</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>A TikTok user in our app will have the basics: a unique id, a name, username, etc.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>userData</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>"</span><span>id_3</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>0</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>name</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>Mo Farooq</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>username</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"</span><span>avatar</span><span>"</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://i.imgur.com/9KYq7VG.png</span><span>"</span>
<span>};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So, let’s add our user into our collection:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// create a new user</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>userData</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can check to make sure your user was stored in the database by reading the user back by any of their properties, like their username.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// find our user by username</span>
<span>const</span> <span>users</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>({</span> <span>username</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>$eq</span><span>:</span> 
  <span>"</span><span>mofarooq32</span><span>"</span> <span>}</span> <span>});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Or, you can lookup a user by their <strong>documentId</strong>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// get the user by document id</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And, lastly, if you need to delete that user:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// delete the post</span>
<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>usersCollection</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>documentId</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>There's a ton of resources scattered around the web dealing with code review fundamentals, best practices, tools, etc. In this article we'll summarize the lessons from a dozen of official company engineering blogs. You can find links to the original articles in <a href="http://localhost:8080/blog/code-reviews"></a><a href="https://blogboard.io/search?searchQuery=code%20review">this blogboard search</a>.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-this-article">What's in this article?</h2><p>We'll cover several topics:</p><ol><li>Why do code reviews?<br>Besides the obvious, quality assurance, there are other benefits to code reviews</li><li>Code reviews as quality assurance<br>We'll cover the general recommendations on what to look for in a code review, why having a review checklist is beneficial, and you'll get a fairly long checklist that you can use as a base for your own list</li><li>Code reviews as a team improvement tool<br>If you've done more than a few code reviews, you know they're useful for more than just preventing bugs. We'll summarize common views on how reviews are beneficial as a learning and team bonding tool</li><li>Preparing a pull request for review<br>Lessons for pull request authors. There are rules of thumb consistently pointed out that help to prepare a PR for a smooth review</li><li>Reviewing code - Be human!<br>Lessons for reviewers on how wording and tone of your comments can make a huge difference in effectiveness of the whole review effort.</li></ol><p>The topics are covered fairly independently, so if you're curious about a particular topic feel free to skip ahead.</p><h2 id="why-do-code-reviews">Why do code reviews?</h2><p>It should be obvious that the primary purpose of code review is to assess quality of the changes being introduced. I mean, the dictionary definition of <em>review </em>says precisely that</p><blockquote><strong>review</strong> <em>(noun) - </em>a formal assessment of something with the intention of instituting change if necessary.</blockquote><p>Of course, code being code, there's a lot of things that can be checked and tested automatically, so there's nuance to what actually needs to be checked in an actual code review. We cover that in the next section.</p><p>On the other hand, code review is a form of communication between the <em><strong>author</strong> </em>of the change (these days usually <em>a pull request</em>) and one or several <em><strong>reviewers</strong>. </em>So it has side effects that go beyond preventing bugs from slipping in or keeping the codebase consistent in terms of style and architecture. </p><p>When done well, code reviews help accelerate learning across the team, create psychological safety for all team members, help establish and communicate best practices, teach proper communication and improve team dynamics. When done poorly, they can help deteriorate all of the above.</p><h2 id="code-reviews-as-quality-assurance">Code reviews as quality assurance </h2><p>There are a bunch of ways in which code reviews help maintain the quality bar for the codebase and the product. In the end it comes down to catching mistakes at the level which can hardly be automatically tested, such as architectural inconsistencies. Also, the code for automated tests should be reviewed, so there's a meta level at which reviews help with QA. </p><p>In <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">Giving High Leverage Code Reviews</a>, Casey Rollins advocates for having a checklist with all the usual things that need attention. </p><blockquote>When I’m reviewing a pull request, I often do multiple “passes” where I focus on one attribute at a time. I start at the beginning and review the pull request with a single attribute in mind before moving on to the next. When I’ve worked through the checklist, I submit the review.<p>This checklist moves from general to specific checks because it’s important to focus on the high-level attributes first. It doesn’t make sense to offer a variable name suggestion if you’re also suggesting that an entire class or function be refactored.</p></blockquote><p>You can have your own checklist or make it a shared list for the team or a project. There's a ton of material written on the usefulness of checklists. In <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting Things Done</a>, </em>David Allen puts forward a simple idea -<em> </em>our minds are great at processing information, but terrible at storing and recalling it. That's why checklists are a great way of externally storing and breaking down a planned or repetitive task.</p><p>Compiled from several articles (<a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">1</a>, <a href="https://engineering.gusto.com/high-leverage-code-reviews/">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">3</a>) here's a high-level list of things to be concerned about when reviewing a code change:</p><ul><li>Story alignment - does the change meet the requirements of the task at all; ie. does the code implement any and all of the specified functionalities?</li><li>Consistency across the codebase</li><li>Architectural considerations - how does the new piece of code fit the existing architecture. Can the new feature architecture be improved, is it too generic or not extensible enough?</li><li>Simplicity/over-engineering</li><li>Performance concerns - are there specific cases (eg. peak load times) when the code will break? Do the queries pull more data than necessary? Could new queries benefit from adding new indexes to the database?</li><li>Accidental errors such as typos or errors in math formulas - these can be either obvious or really tricky to notice, especially with math heavy code</li><li>Compliance with laws and regulations - depending on the business this might be the most important thing</li><li>Security concerns - are there any exploitable pieces of code being introduced? Are any secrets being shared or stored unsafely?</li><li>Readability and style - a seemingly perfect piece of code might not be immediately understandable and readable to a different pair of eyes. Is it possible to understand the changes without the author explaining them?</li><li>Best practices - programming languages usually have their best practices - are they met in the pull request? Also, with time any project, team and company will evolve their own set of best practices - code reviews are a way to enforce and spread knowledge about them</li><li>Localization - are all language dependent resources localized properly?</li><li>Dependencies - are there external libraries or APIs being introduced? Are there other simpler/faster/better ways to do this with different dependencies or without any?</li><li>Interactions and side effects - how does the new piece of code interact with the rest of the codebase; does the new function implementation break any existing functionality; are all relevant unit tests updated/added</li><li>Logging - it's practically impossible to debug server code properly without good logging. Is everything logged/traced correctly</li><li>Error handling - how are the errors handled on the backend; how are they communicated to the user; are fallbacks activated where possible?</li><li>Testability/Test coverage - is the new piece of code covered with automated tests? Have all the suspicious test cases been checked either automatically or manually? Is the code written in a way that's suitable for unit testing?</li><li>External documentation - in case it's necessary is the external documentation updated to reflect the change?</li></ul><p>It's a pretty long list. In addition to it, a recurring piece of advice is not to use code reviews in place of static code analysis tools. If your review is mostly about code formatting, variable naming and alphabetical ordering, it might be a good time to include an automated code analysis tool into your development workflow.</p><p>In <em><a href="https://medium.com/paypal-engineering/effective-code-reviews-53d62a203b2f">Effective Code Reviews: Bettering Products, Teams, and Engineers</a> </em>from PayPal engineering<em>, </em>Gabriel McAdams points out several important benefits of code reviews related to team dynamics:</p><ul><li>Team cohesion - by making everyone's code subject to peer review, code review process promotes <em>individual accountability, healthy conflict</em> and the idea that everyone's<em> working together</em> to make the product better. As said in <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a>: <em>Code reviews are classless: being the most senior person on the team does not imply that your code does not need review.</em><br>In summary, McAdams puts it nicely: <em>Trust + healthy conflict + individual accountability + working together to better the team = team cohesion.</em></li><li>Free career improvement training - simply by virtue of reviewing other people's code you become more skilled at reading and understanding new code. I've heard it said that one of the foremost traits of great engineers is the ability to dive into and dissect a completely unfamiliar piece of code. Over time you learn how to spot common practices, little tricks, pieces of syntactic sugar, architectural abstractions and how to appreciate different mental models used to solve the same problem.</li></ul><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/palantir/code-review-best-practices-19e02780015f">Code Review Best Practices</a> from the Palantir Blog, Robert Fink lists several ways in which knowledge sharing and social side-effects happen via code reviews:</p><ul><li>Authors are motivated by the peer review process to do all the necessary pre-checks, tighten the loose ends and generally tidy up the code before sending to review</li><li>A code review explicitly communicates changes made to product functionality to team members</li><li>The author maybe used a technique, abstraction or an algorithm that reviewers are unfamiliar with. The opposite can also be the case - reviewers might be aware of a more appropriate way to solve a given problem</li><li>Positive communication strengthens social bonds within the team (might especially be true for remote teams)</li></ul><h2 id="preparing-a-pull-request-for-review-help-the-reviewer">Preparing a pull request for review - help the reviewer</h2><p>Code reviews should be seen as a team effort. Once you view them that way it becomes clear that both sides - the author and the reviewers - have their distinct sets of responsibilities.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.engineering/the-code-review-mindset-3280a4af0a89">this short post</a> on Medium Engineering blog, Xiao Ma describes how a different perspective changes the way code reviews are done, how feedback is taken and how people on each side benefit by adopting a <em>positive mindset</em> about code reviews.</p><p>When we talk about the responsibilities of the pull request author, there are several key things recurring in all code review guides.</p><ol><li><strong>Make pull requests as atomic as possible</strong><br><a href="https://shopify.engineering/great-code-reviews">At Shopify</a> they advise to keep <em>your pull requests small </em>- it helps the reviewer dive into it and finish it as an atomic piece of work in their workday. In practice this can mean keeping your pull requests limited to <em>a single concern. </em>A single concern here means a single bug fix, a feature, an API change etc. Don't mix refactoring that doesn't alter behavior with bug fixes or new features. This is …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

                    <p>When you're just getting started building your own projects marketing seems like a daunting task, especially if your background is in development. You spend some time learning what you can about marketing but a lot of advice relies on utilising your "network".</p><p>That assumes you have a network.</p><p>If you're like me and few of your friends are interested in the products you build, that advice is completely useless.</p><p>Next, they'll suggest you reach out to your wider network and get their support in sharing your project. You'll read articles on "how I got 1000 signups for my product in two weeks" that fail to mention their 5000 followers on Twitter.</p><p>What I've learnt is that you have to look past these tips and focus on scalable and automated methods of growth when you're friendless. Is it harder? Definitely. Does it take a lot longer? 100%. Will you look on enviously as others with networks instantly launch to thousands of signups and acclaim? Absolutely.</p><p>But there is a bright side. Scalable methods are sustainable. They have long-term value while a large network can provide a false indicator of success. If your product is solving a real problem you'll get more rewards from focusing on sustainable methods of growth early on.</p><p>For every new project, I focus on creating small but steady streams of traffic and optimising how I capture that traffic for long-term growth.</p><h3 id="1-seo">1. SEO</h3><p>The first step is setting up your product pages or landing page perfectly for SEO. This means meta tags, titles with keywords, sub-pages that target niche keywords, and so on. You can find specific tips on this everywhere and if you're building a directory site <a href="http://keenen.xyz/seo-tips-for-online-directories/">these tips</a> might be even more helpful.</p><h3 id="2-submit-to-aggregators">2. Submit to Aggregators </h3><p>Next, you want to submit your project to aggregation sites to drive some traffic to your page. Product Hunt, Reddit, Hacker News, etc are all great for this. Submit to as many as you can and let the traffic flow in. Chances are without a network your project won't be number one on any of these sites but you're likely to get a decent bit of traffic and some initial users. Check out this <a href="https://github.com/mmccaff/PlacesToPostYourStartup">comprehensive list here</a>.</p><p>It's also a great way for getting backlinks that will compound the effect of the initial SEO work you did. I try to submit to as many startup directories and Product Hunt clones as I find and hope they use dofollow links. If you get a backlink great. If they don't but you get some traffic that's fine too. If you get nothing 🤷‍♀️, it was free anyway (you definitely shouldn't pay to be listed on the majority of those sites, it's not worth it).</p><h3 id="3-email-signups">3. Email signups</h3><p>Whatever you're doing you should be collecting emails in some form. You want to be able to communicate with users of your product even if you don't require signup to use it. Create an account on Mailchimp or some other email service provider, embed a signup form on your page, and you're sure to get some signups.</p><p>As traffic trickles in from aggregators and SEO you'll begin to capture some emails. Once you do have a handful of signups you can start sharing regular updates with them. Chances are some of them will be drawn back to your product with each issue you send.</p><h3 id="4-reuse-content">4. Reuse Content</h3><p>If your product generates content you should find some way to share it on social media. Preferably in an automated way. Add relevant hashtags to each post and they can drive another bit of traffic to your product. With InboxReads I share every new submission to its' Twitter &amp; Facebook accounts and that results in a steady stream of traffic.</p><p>Emails you send can also be reused for future traffic. When picking an email service provider I would find one that creates indexable blog posts from each email you send. This means each issue becomes a piece of content that links back to your main product.</p><h3 id="5-optimize-repeat">5. Optimize &amp; Repeat</h3><p>Chances are you won't get everything right the first time. You might have misconfigured some meta tags or your social media work is just not getting any attention. It's important to be constantly analysing your results and testing new ideas to improve these steps. As you better understand your audience you'll be able to finetune this process to capture even more traffic.</p><p>These steps aren't likely to make you instantly rich or famous. You shouldn't expect a profile in TechCrunch or an influx of new followers. But they can give you a small but reliable and organic stream of traffic that lets you determine your product's viability. If it is viable then you would have invested time into sustainable and scalable marketing methods from the beginning. </p><p>And maybe you'll make some friends along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>When Bill Gates was asked in a Vox interview <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> on what he feared most, his reply was not climate change or nuclear war.</p>
<p>Mr. Gates was most worried about pandemics, deadly diseases that spread quickly over large regions, he goes ahead to cite some of the biggest “death charts” of history.</p>
<p>These “death charts”, where several spikes in which a large numbers of people died in a very short period.</p>
<p>The first “death chart” he mentions is World War I, the second one is World War II, the third spike or “death chart” was about two times bigger than World War I (50 million deaths), but it was not caused by a war, it was the spanish flu <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This isn’t even the worst case, pandemics like the the black plague killed over 200 million (60% of Europe’s population at the time) about 2 times a bigger death toll than any war we have ever had<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Pandemics are real &amp; unpredictable as we have seen with Ebola <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, SARs <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, and at the time of this writing, the Corona virus<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The problem is that, we are often not prepared for these pandemics. For instance, during the Ebola pandemic in West Africa, 11,000 died simply because the responsible bureaucrats could not mobilize enough resources in time.</p>
<p>There was an idea from the World Health Organization (WHO) to use create a kind of insurance market they call a Pandemic bond.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>How it would work is that, a pool of money (equivalent to whats needed to finance an Ebola pandemic) would be put up by speculators.</p>
<p>The WHO would then continuously pay the speculators a kind of insurance premium. But if a new Ebola out break occurred in a new country, the WHO would use the pool of money (put up by the speculators) to facilitate the mitigation of Ebola in that region. This is obviously an over simplification of the 300 plus page document that explains how these pandemic bonds actually work<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> but I hope you get the idea? Its basically health insurance for everyone subsidized by the WHO.</p>
<p>The pandemic bonds have however become controversial<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> probably due to their poor mechanism design<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>. Despite this fact, I think mechanism designers can come up with better mechanisms resembling these “pandemic bonds” that actually work in a society.</p>
<p>The great thing about Smart-contracts like Solidity<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>, Scilla<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> &amp; Simplicity<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> is that, they allow us to design trust minimized financial instruments, thus incorporating a strain of these pandemic bonds into what is now popularly defined as DeFI or decentralized finance<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We can have several of these DeFi (Decentralized Finance) powered applications to mitigate several problems around disease.</p>
<p>For instance, Animal husbandry businesses can pay these premiums to mitigate risks around animal disease pandemics like bird flu or mad cow disease.</p>
<p>Charities or Governments can pay these premiums to to secure resources for fighting pandemic out breaks like the recent Corona virus.
The recent Corona virus for example is so new, there exists no cure<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>. In such a case, the pool speculators put up would be used for research towards the creation of a vaccine.</p>
<p>Another way of using DeFi to mitigate disease pandemics is by leveraging prediction markets like Augur<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> &amp; Gnosis<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> to create an “event derivative” that may assist in the mitigation of a disease.
Event derivatives are markets that pay people for accurately predicting events in the future<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></p>
<p>An example event derivative is a market we can call, “Will it rain on Thursday, next week?”. Before Thursday next week, people can bet “YES” or “NO” on if it will really rain on that day.
If it rains, people who bet “YES” win the bet &amp; people who voted “NO” have their money transferred to people that bet “YES”.</p>
<p>Coming back to disease pandemics, we can have a question like “Will there be a vaccine for Corona viral infections?”. In theory, this “event derivative” should incentivize the release of information that may lead to the creation of an Corona viral infection.</p>
<p>The market can also be subsidized by an entity through increasing the stakes to be won if incase the market outcome ins “YES”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2, a deep-learning model that predicts protein structures, achieved significant improvements over other methods in the biannual CAPS protein folding prediction competition.</li>
  <li>The improvements are so large that some claim protein folding is a solved problem. However, while almost all applaud the impressive advancement, many note the caveats and limitations of AlphaFold 2 in both the problem of protein folding and downstream uses in biology.</li>
  <li>After weighing the opinions of many experts, we take the view that while AlphaFold 2 should be celebrated, it is still just one step (though a big one!), and will not significantly advance practical applications like drug discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>

<p>On the last day of November 2020, Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP), a biennial challenge for computational biologists on the problem of “protein folding”, released its results, showing DeepMind’s AI-driven <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">Alphafold 2</a> outperforming its competitors by a large margin. 
The pace of Alphafold’s improvement came as a shock to many researchers and mainstream media publications, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55133972">who heralded the development as a game-changer for biology</a>. 
Others acknowledged the uses of the tool, but <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/">cautioned that there were many more challenges </a>in the protein-folding prediction space that may warrant a tempering of expectations, let alone the broader field of biology.</p>

<p>In the world of proteins, form determines function. 
Thus, the ability to look forward and predict protein structures would help all kinds of biology subfields, from the more basic science work to drug discovery. 
Historically, attempts to model proteins have failed due to exponentially increasing computing costs, but <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/3433701.3433707">specialized computational hardware</a> appears well-equipped to address this issue.</p>

<p>Alphafold made some waves with its 2018 CASP win, but the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/12/google-s-deepmind-aces-protein-folding">media coverage was decidedly more muted then</a>. 
The pace of Alphafold’s 2020 improvement on top of its own success in 2018 was shocking for many experts, who felt that a solution to the <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/major-scientific-advance-deepmind-ai-alphafold-solves-50-year-old-grand-challenge-of-protein-structure-prediction/">50-year old protein-solving problem </a>was finally in sight. 
One important note is that AlphaFold 2, like other methods submitted to CASP, doesn’t actually model <em>how</em> proteins fold - it just predicts the final structure of the protein after it has folded.</p>

<p>There are a number of quality blog posts that explain protein folding and AlphaFold 2. <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford">Jason Crawford</a> at Roots of Progress gives an accessible review of protein folding in <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/alphafold-protein-folding-explainer">What is the “protein folding problem”? A brief explanation.</a> It is also summarized in this excellent Twitter thread:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today Google <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepMind?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DeepMind</a> announced that their deep learning system AlphaFold has achieved unprecedented levels of accuracy on the “protein folding problem”, a grand challenge problem in computational biochemistry.</p><p>What is this problem, and why is it hard?<a href="https://t.co/OjbP3RBPEi">https://t.co/OjbP3RBPEi</a></p></div>— Jason Crawford (@jasoncrawford) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1333576221418930176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote>


<p>For a more technical explanation of AlphaFold 2 itself, we refer readers to the blog posts by <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/">Mohammed AlQuraishi</a> and <a href="https://www.blopig.com/blog/2020/12/casp14-what-google-deepminds-alphafold-2-really-achieved-and-what-it-means-for-protein-folding-biology-and-bioinformatics/">Carlos Outeiral</a>. In summary, DeepMind trained a neural network model on 170k known protein structures in the publicly available <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/">Protein Data Bank dataset (PDB)</a>. In addition to its many novel architecture designs, one important aspect of this neural network seems to be its use of attention mechanisms, a similar kind of architecture used by recent state-of-the-art language models like GPT-3.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An attention-based technique was used, which has shown promise across ML in language/vision/etc. This allows for efficient learning (ie capturing relations between elements) and uncovering broader principles: <a href="https://t.co/hKTcb5mTkr">https://t.co/hKTcb5mTkr</a></p>— Ali Madani (@thisismadani) <a href="https://twitter.com/thisismadani/status/1333481997210161160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2020</a></blockquote>


<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Very exciting results this week from AlphaFold in CASP14. An incredible and inspiring achievement by the DeepMind team. Many new possibilities.</p><p>*Attention* mechanism is key to the result.

<h2 id="the-reactions">The Reactions</h2>

<h3 id="from-the-press">From the Press</h3>

<p>The press was very optimistic about AlphaFold 2’s progress in protein folding and its broader implications in biology and beyond, with headlines like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nature: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">‘It will change everything’: DeepMind’s AI makes gigantic leap in solving protein structures</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="from-the-experts">From the Experts</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/c_outeiral/status/1334779365280903169">Carlos Outeiral</a>, Computational Biology research scientist at Oxford, also highlighted the “astoundingly” impressive results of AlphaFold 2, in the post <a href="https://www.blopig.com/blog/2020/12/casp14-what-google-deepminds-alphafold-2-really-achieved-and-what-it-means-for-protein-folding-biology-and-bioinformatics/">CASP14: what Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 really achieved, and what it means for protein folding, biology and bioinformatics</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After three decades of competitions, the assessors declared that AlphaFold 2 had succeeded in solving a challenge open for 50 years: to develop a method that can accurately, generally and competitively predict a protein structure from its sequence (or, well, a multiple sequence alignment, as we will see later). There are caveats and edge cases, as in any application — but the magnitude of the breakthrough, as well as its potential impact, are undeniable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing AlphaFold 2’s results to those of other methods: “AlphaFold 2’s accuracy is simply on a whole different level.”</p>

<p>Similarly, <a href="https://twitter.com/MoAlQuraishi">Mohammed AlQuraishi</a>, Professor of Systems Biology at Columbia, gave praise to DeepMind’s achievements:</p>

<p>In his detailed blog post last year on the first iteration of AlphaFold, <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/alphafold-casp13-what-just-happened/#s2.2">AlphaFold @ CASP13: “What just happened?”</a>, Professor AlQuraishi discussed what DeepMind’s progress meant for academia and pharmaceutical companies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is “an indictment of academic science” - “There are dozens of academic groups, with researchers likely numbering in the (low) hundreds, working on protein structure prediction. […] For DeepMind’s group of ~10 researchers, with primarily (but certainly not exclusively) ML expertise, to so thoroughly route everyone surely demonstrates the structural inefficiency of academic science.”</li>
  <li>This is also “an indictment of pharma” - “What is worse than academic groups getting scooped by DeepMind? The fact that the collective powers of Novartis, Pfizer, etc, with their hundreds of thousands (~million?) of employees, let an industrial lab that is a complete outsider to the field, with virtually no prior molecular sciences experience, come in and thoroughly beat them on a problem that is, quite frankly, of far greater importance to pharmaceuticals than it is to Alphabet.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Responding to this year’s AlphaFold 2 is his new post <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/">AlphaFold2 @ CASP14: “It feels like one’s child has left home.”</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While AlphaFold 2 still has a lot of caveats, Professor AlQuraishi defends using “solved” to describe protein folding, at least in the scientific sense. He argues the remaining deficiencies of AlphaFold 2 are not scientific problems, but rather engineering ones. While engineering problems can still be exceedingly difficult, “competent domain experts know the pieces that need to fall into place to solve them.”</li>
  <li>As for AlphaFold 2’s potential applications to advance biology as a whole: “It won’t happen overnight. None of what I’m saying here will. It will take years and maybe decades, but now that protein structure prediction has become an engineering exercise, we know that many of these ideas can be realized.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically for drug development:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I will end this section with the question that gets asked most often about protein structure prediction—will it change drug discovery? Truthfully, in the short term, the answer is most likely no. But it’s complicated. 
One important thing to note is that, of the entire drug development pipeline, the early discovery stage is just that, an early stage. Even if crystallography were to become fast and routine, it would still not fundamentally alter the dynamics of drug discovery as it is practiced today, as most of the cost is in the later stages of drug development beyond medicinal chemistry and well into biology and physiology. Reliable protein structure prediction doesn’t change that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, not everyone saw the same magnitude of advancement in AlphaFold 2.
In the post <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/">No, DeepMind has not solved protein folding</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Stephen_Curry">Stephen Curry</a>, Professor of Structural Biology at Imperial College London, cautioned against using the word “solved” to describe protein folding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But we are not yet at the point where we can say that protein folding is ‘solved’. For one thing, only two-thirds of DeepMind’s solutions were comparable to the experimentally determined structure of the protein. This is impressive but you have to bear in mind that they didn’t know which two-thirds of their predictions were correct until the comparison with experimental solutions was made. Would you buy a satnav that was only 67% accurate?
So a dose of realism is required. It is also difficult to see right now, despite DeepMind’s impressive performance, that this will immediately transform biology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite AlphaFold 2’s average accuracy of 1.6 Å:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>it’s still not nearly good enough for delivering reliable insights into protein chemistry or drug design. To do that, we want to be confident of atomic positions to …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<hr>
<p>I wrote this post as a result of my frustration with popular business books and with non-fiction books in general. I am not saying every book is like this, some books are insightful and bring new ideas and perspectives to the table. But I have noticed that some authors have an idea and without fleshing it out and properly researching it they decide to write a book about it. Throw in cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias and an incompetent publishers and you have got yourself a popular non-fiction book. There is no peer review and if you sensationalize things you can earn a lot of money. </p>
<p>You cannot even trust books by experts in the field. I bought into the hype of the book Why We Sleep  by Matthew Walker the author seemed legit and well respected within his field. He even appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience. After reading the book I  began espousing the benefits of 8 hour sleep until I read <a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/">this</a> wonderful article by Alexey Guzey. So who should you trust? Should you stop reading non-fiction altogether? I suggest doing the opposite, read as much as you can and be wary of any broad sweeping statements. Even though some books might get something wrong, the good ideas are still valuable. And as with business you can only get better at it (i.e. filtering signal) by exposing yourself to more of it.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

The vaccine was well tolerated by participants and has no important safety concerns. The benefit-to-risk assessment for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is considered favourable."</p>  <p>Canada is just the third country in the world to authorize the vaccine, after the United Kingdom and Bahrain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will hear tomorrow from an advisory panel on whether the vaccine is safe for use in the United States and&nbsp;authorization&nbsp;is&nbsp;expected in "a matter of days," U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said Wednesday.</p>  <p>Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said&nbsp;249,000 doses of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine will be on hand by year's end — shots primarily earmarked&nbsp;for long-term care home residents and the staff working there.</p>  <p>Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, the military commander leading vaccination logistics at the national operations centre,&nbsp;said 30,000 doses out of the&nbsp;initial run&nbsp;will be shipped from a Pfizer plant in Belgium on Friday.</p>  <p>"We expect&nbsp;vaccines to arrive as early as Monday," Fortin&nbsp;said, adding it's "totally possible" some&nbsp;Canadians could get their&nbsp;shots&nbsp;by mid-week.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5834779.1607545281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/covid-cda-vaccine-20201209.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin, left, said some Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses could arrive as early as Monday.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Njoo said as many as six million doses will arrive&nbsp;in the first three months of 2021. Assuming other&nbsp;promising vaccine candidates from companies like Moderna and AstraZeneca secure regulatory approvals, millions more shots will come online in the months to follow, he said.</p>  <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said today the country will begin immunizing non-priority populations — people other than the elderly, health care workers and some adults in Indigenous communities —&nbsp;in April 2021. The vaccination campaign is expected to end next December.</p>  <p>"At last, we have a reason to feel optimistic and excited about returning to the lives we led pre-COVID," Njoo said. "Things are happening quickly."</p>  <p>Speaking in question period today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the Pfizer-BioNTech approval a "big deal" because it signals that the end of this destructive pandemic is in sight.</p>  <p>"It's a good news day for Canadians but we are not through this yet. We have a tough winter to go through," Trudeau said, urging Canadians to respect public health measures&nbsp;even as shots start to arrive.</p>  <h2>Long-term care homes to be among first to get vaccine</h2>  <p>The Pfizer trial had&nbsp;more than 43,000 participants — one of the largest such trials ever conducted — and regulators found that the vaccine's efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics.</p>  <p>The vaccine is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;groundbreaking&nbsp;messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, which essentially directs cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease.</p>  <p>The shot was found to be 94.7 per cent effective among clinical&nbsp;trial subjects who were over the age of 65 and who had no prior COVID-19 infection — a significant finding, given most&nbsp;novel coronavirus-related deaths in Canada have been reported among the elderly.</p>    <p>While the&nbsp;Pfizer vaccine has been given the necessary approvals, regulators conceded that the clinical&nbsp;trial data could not establish&nbsp;the long-term efficacy of the vaccine.</p>  <p>It is not yet known how long the vaccine-induced immunity will last but Health Canada said it will implement a robust "risk management plan"&nbsp;to monitor immunity and gather data on when it begins to wane. The regulator will also track any&nbsp;"adverse events" that follow immunization.</p>  <p>Cole Pinnow, the president of Pfizer Canada, said Health Canada's approval means the country can start to return to a sense of "normalcy," with&nbsp;millions of Canadians&nbsp;set to be vaccinated over the coming months.</p>  <p>"This is historic. We couldn't be more proud that Pfizer and BioNTech were able to bring to Canada the first COVID-19 vaccine. We think this represents a monumental change in the way that we are fighting the pandemic, and hopefully represents the first big step towards normalcy," Pinnow said in an interview with CBC Radio's&nbsp;<em>The Current</em>.</p>  <p>With recent polls showing that a sizeable number of Canadians will refuse a vaccine altogether, or will wait some time before lining up for a shot, Pinnow said he wants Canadians to be assured the product is safe.</p>  <p>"I would reassure Canadians that the scientific rigour and regulatory oversight that went into this product is as robust, if not more robust, than any other vaccine that's been brought to market," he said.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH: Pfizer addresses vaccine concerns:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Dr. Sharma calls the approval of the Pfizer vaccine a 'critical milestone' in the fight against COVID-19." role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1829647939789-metadata-" title="Dr. Sharma calls the approval of the Pfizer vaccine a 'critical milestone' in the fight against COVID-19."><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/1017/255/ftr_SHARMA_approval_frame_3575_corrected.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Health Canada chief medical adviser Dr. Supriya Sharma briefed reporters on the vaccine's approval during a briefing on Wednesday.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:19</span></span></span></p>  <p>Dr. Supriya Sharma, the chief medical adviser at Health Canada, also sought to reassure Canadians that her department conducted a "rigorous" review of all the product's&nbsp;clinical trial and technical information.</p>  <p>She said&nbsp;scientists&nbsp;found "strong evidence"&nbsp;that the vaccine's potential benefits far outweigh any risks.</p>  <p>"Canadians can have confidence ... the vaccine was authorized only after a thorough assessment of the evidence demonstrated it had met Health Canada's strict standards for efficacy, safety and quality," she said.</p>  <p>"It's an exceptional day for Canada.

<p>Handbrake is an open-source video transcoder that’s widely regarded as the best tool for video conversion. It’s effortless to use, multi-platform, and it covers a vast range of presets and devices as well. This means you will find it easier than ever to compress videos quickly without having to spend money on a conversion or transcoding tool. Instead, you can compress video using Handbrake very quickly, and the results will be great.</p>

<h2>Select the source file and open it</h2>



<p>Once you finish installing the app, open it.</p>



<p>Go to the left side of the app, choose the Source Selection and then flick File. Then you can choose the file you want to compress and click Open. Once the file is loaded, you can choose where to save it simply by clicking Browse. Make sure that you create a name for the video so you can identify it with ease. Add whatever name you are comfortable with, and then press Save.</p>

<h2>Picking the container type and video codec</h2>



<p>Right under the output settings, you can select the container. Ideally, you want to go with the <code>MP4</code> container format, unless you have any specific containers in mind. Under that you have the Video tab, here you want to select the H.264 codec.</p>

<p>Here you can also select the desired framerate and quality types. The app has options for different video qualities, such as web, HD, and so on. Or you can go with an average bitrate instead of a certain quality. The framerate can be <code>30</code> FPS or more. It all depends on the initial framerate of your video. Most of the time, settling for <code>30</code> FPS will do just fine.</p>



<h2>Selecting a preset</h2>



<p>One of the main benefits of Handbrake is that it has a vast range of presets. You can browse the list of presets on the right side of the user interface. </p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="656" src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=1024%2C656&amp;ssl=1" alt="compress video using handbrake" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=1024%2C656&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=768%2C492&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?w=1032&amp;ssl=1 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20656'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=1024%2C656&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=300%2C192&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=768%2C492&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?w=1032&amp;ssl=1 1032w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-16.png?resize=1024%2C656&amp;ssl=1"></figure></div>



<p>Normally you can go for <code>Fast 1080p 30</code>, as this is of great quality. But you can easily experiment with a variety of presets and see how the results turn out in the end. The average bitrate for a video should be anywhere from <code>5000</code> to <code>10000</code> kbps. Normally the higher the bitrate is, the better the video quality, but this will take a longer time to process and upload.</p>



<h2>Modifying the resolution and picture options</h2>



<p>In the Dimensions panel, you can see the source resolution and you can keep that or choose whatever resolution you find ok. Here you can also change the Anamorphic mode to None. Ideally, you want to have the modulus option to <code>16</code>. A good rule of thumb is to maintain the aspect ratio, you can do that simply by ticking the option with the same name right near the picture size.</p>

<h2>Modifying audio information</h2>



<p>Go to the Audio tab, here you can modify the sample rate and other options the way you want. A lot of people use <code>48</code> or <code>64</code> kbps as the ideal sample rate, and the mixdown is Stereo. You can also change the audio codec, not to mention you can modify the bitrate. You may want to stick with a <code>320</code> bitrate, as it delivers the best quality.</p>

<h2>Start the encoding process</h2>



<p>Once you fully customized everything, you want to press the Start Encode button. Then you can leave or do something else, as Handbrake will work on the video compression. </p>



<p>You will receive a notification when everything is fully completed.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Compressing any video using Handbrake helps a lot, and this free tool does bring in front incredible results. It does take a bit to get used to the interface, but with a little experimentation, you will have no problems. We recommend you to give Handbrake a try today, and you will be incredibly impressed with its ease of use and incredible compression quality!</p>

<p>Wednesday, December 9, 2020</p>
<p>This is a guest post by Arijit Dey, introducing a cross-platform <em>paging crate</em> he wrote, which will allow Pijul to work equally on all platforms.</p>
<p>Hello everyone. Before I continue on with this blog post, I really want to thank
Pierre-Étienne Meunier for giving me this opportunity to write a blog post on their website</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to talk about <em>Minus</em>, which is a cross-platform, asynchronous terminal paging library written in Rust. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/arijit79/minus.git">here</a></p>
<h2 id="why-i-wrote-minus">Why I wrote minus</h2>
<p>I started writing minus because of my work on <a href="https://pijul.com/">Pijul</a>.
It all started with a discussion where I pointed out that we should use a pager for easier viewing of pijul logs/diffs/credits. After getting encouragement from a few people, I started working on a implementation, unfortunately all of the existing Rust paging crates were kind a unsatisfactory to me.
The first option that I looked into was <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pager">pager</a>. It was a popular library and had good documentation. I had to write only a few lines to start using it. And this is when I got my first dissatisfaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>It did not have a pager of it’s own, but rather required one of the existing pager such as <code>less</code> or <code>more</code> to be available</li>
<li>There was a bug, where if you reach the end of output, the pager is going to stop taking inputs. You needed to press <code>Ctrl+C</code> and then <code>q</code> to quit (this has been fixed in Pijul by exiting explicitly with <code>std::env::exit(0)</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Two days later, I discovered bigger problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since it requires an external pager, you have to package something like <code>less</code> or <code>more</code> along with the binary</li>
<li>Also, it used a lot of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/libc">libc</a> functions that are UNIX-specific, which means there was a big problem regarding portability</li>
</ul>
<p>Between these two days, I had submitted another implementation using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/moins">moins</a> crate. It did solve the first two issues, but introduced another issue: indeed, there can be a long hang-up when running log/diff/credit on a really large repository, and due to the nature of the <code>moins</code> crate, the data must be supplied entirely before anything is rendered, which means we cannot atomically update the result.</p>
<p>Although the first implementation using the <code>pager</code> crate was merged into the main Pijul codebase, I wasn’t really happy with the implementation. So I wrote a small post on the <a href="https://discourse.pijul.org/">Pijul Discourse</a> about writing a new paging library for Pijul.</p>
<h2 id="the-planning">The Planning</h2>
<p>The first thing before starting any project is to understand what your project’s primary goals are. What are the most important things that it must solve? For minus, these are the primary goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>The crate is the pager; it should not depend on any external program.</li>
<li>It should be asynchronous. It is the key factor for paging dynamic output. Also it should work with both <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio">tokio</a> as well as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/async-std">async-std</a> runtimes.</li>
<li>It should be cross-platform and distributable in a single binary.</li>
<li>No bloat. Application developers select what features they want; that’s it, nothing extra.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>Some dependencies just immediately solve most problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/crossterm">Crossterm</a>: Provides platform-abstracted functions for terminal access. Crossterm uses both libc as well as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/winapi">winapi</a> for working in both Unix-like systems as well as Windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio">Tokio</a>/<a href="https://crates.io/crates/async-std">async-std</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/futures">Futures</a>, for providing functions to write asynchronous code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Without going into all the hit and trials that I had to do, I am going straight to the current implementation</p>
<p>For different applications, different features and functions are available</p>
<ul>
<li>If the application uses tokio, enable <code>tokio_lib</code> feature and appropriate initializer function is <code>tokio_updating</code></li>
<li>If the application uses async-std, enable <code>async_std_lib</code> feature and appropriate initializer function is <code>async_std_updating</code></li>
<li>If the application is planning to output static information, enable <code>static_output</code> function and appropriate function is <code>page_all</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The application has to initialize an <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> and give a clone of it to the respective dynamic initializer function. If you are paging static output, <code>page_all</code> takes a <code>String</code> rather than an <code>Arc</code>.</p>
<p>Minus then initializes itself, switching to alternate screen of the terminal, enabling raw mode of the terminal and hiding the cursor. Then it checks whether there are more lines in the terminal, then the number of lines in the output. In case of dynamic paging, it keeps continuously updating with new information.
In static paging, minus prints the entire output and quits</p>
<p>If there are more lines of output than number of rows, it only displays a range of output, between <code>upper_mark</code> and <code>lower_mark</code>. <code>upper_mark</code> is what we keep a track of, it is simply a pointer of scrolling: whenever the user presses the down arrow key, we increment <code>upper_mark</code> by 1 and when they press the arrow up key, we decrement <code>upper_mark</code>. <code>lower_mark</code> is a calculated value, using this formula</p>
<blockquote>
<p>upper_mark + number of lines in terminal = lower_mark</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While doing all this, we also check for events, up arrow, down arrow, <code>q</code> or <code>Ctrl+C</code> resets all changes to terminal and quits. Resize events sent by Crossterm update the number of lines in terminal.</p>
<p>So that’s a quick rundown of the inner workings of minus and how it works with other top-level programs.</p>
<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>There have been some questions about what others can expect from minus. Let me clear them here:</p>
<h3 id="is-there-any-plan-to-make-minus-replace-less">Is there any plan to make minus replace less?</h3>
<p>As far as I am concerned, I currently don’t have any plans to do so. But I really encourage the community to make something out of it. There are some things which are application specific, like piping stdout of another program into stdin of the application.</p>
<h3 id="are-there-plans-to-integrate-it-with-other-rust-cli-tools-like-ripgrepbat">Are there plans to integrate it with other Rust CLI tools like ripgrep.bat?</h3>
<p>I am ready to work with these guys to maybe integrate minus into something like bat/ripgrep to provide better output. This would bring lots of improvements to minus as well.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-name-minus">Why the name ‘minus’?</h3>
<p>Minus is the Latin translation of less</p>
<h3 id="does-minus-support-formatted-output-like-boldcolors">Does minus support formatted output like bold/colors?</h3>
<p>Absolutely, just make sure that every line starts and resets the formatting.
Basically your line should be a concatenation of regular text and sequences like:</p>
<p>(Whatever formatting ANSI sequence)(regular text)(Reset sequence)</p>
<p>If you’re using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ansi_term">ansi_term</a>, use something like this</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// Assuming formatted_line is the final input to the pager
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>formatted_line</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>new</span><span>();</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>line</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World"</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>formatted_line</span><span>.</span><span>push_str</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>ansi_term</span>::<span>Colour</span>::<span>Blue</span><span>.</span><span>paint</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>).</span><span>to_string</span><span>());</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>minus</span>::<span>page_all</span><span>(</span><span>formatted_line</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>So, that’s some quick introduction and workings of minus. Pijul developers are currently working to integrate it in Pijul. I am also currently to make minus more efficient and bug free. I hope this blog post helps.</p>

December 9, 2020 | https://rev.ng/blog/bashml/post.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rev.ng/blog/bashml/post.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          

<p>In one of our many research projects here at rev.ng, we are dealing with <strong>Big Data</strong> (is a 1..10 TB compressed database dump big? Well, probably not, but it is for us).
Our first approach was to extract the data and store it in an SQL database, then run a bunch of queries and finally export the processed tables for other purposes.
See the problem there? We used to use the database just like a, err... data processing tool?
Unfortunately this wasn't working very well: we were having all kinds of performance bottlenecks since we were doing bulk inserts and bulk selects.</p>
<p>We then thought of using <a href="https://spark.apache.org/"><strong>Spark</strong></a> or some other fancy stuff like that in order to stream process everything and just use text files.
But, you know, we are a binary analysis company so most of the people here don't like garbage collectors (except me, the author of this blogpost, who like them very much).
Anyway, we went from using MySQL to MongoDB+MySQL to MongoDB+PostgreSQL to, you guessed it, text <strong>files + good ol' Bash</strong>.</p>
<p>In this article I will persuade you, CEO at a brand-new Spark'ing startup that, sometimes, <strong>Bash'ing is all you need</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://rev.ng/blog/bashml/edited.svg"></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't checked out our Big Match post, <a href="https://rev.ng/blog/big-match/post.html">go read it</a>.</p>

          
          
            <h2>An example dataset</h2>
<p>For this tutorial we will be using a simplified version of our internal <strong>Big Match</strong> dataset of github repositories. It consists of a set of txt files and each of them contains a newline-separated list of sha256 hashes of strings found in a repo.</p>
<p>So for example, in file <code>torvalds,linux.hashes.txt</code> we have all the hashes of all the strings found in the linux kernel. They are also sorted for ease of use. It's clear that we use commas in place of <code>'/'</code> as a separator between username and repo name.
So, in this case, <code>torvalds,linux.hashes.txt</code> refers to the GitHub repo <code>torvalds/linux</code>.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at one of our files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>head -n <span>5</span> ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>0000130323884123bd36b3460e2311191fb0663dc7765e2781b62e1bb4fb1694
000020f8aa6016e534263f726778ea7ed6f8bdc6eaad4db703200b37ae6cf00b
000050a6f4869b1ccb3dc2f76f857561d3bae7c1d01e7153c1a6ef543abbd3ff
000052d246cfb78ed0a80bd74071664dc6cb76e3b5586dfed18d8613251fdeba
00006711c3893c6716caeb147e8894ed5bd9a02d1b8743ac5b207ffcf4508494
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>wc -l ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>540297 ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt
</pre></div>
<p>But before delving into the fun part, let's fix locale issues between tools. Trust me, you do want to do this, otherwise you will get all sorts of error when piping together different commands (e.g.: <code>sort</code> and <code>join</code> don't like each other very much).</p>

<h2>Building blocks</h2>
<p>Bash tools have all kinds of different options and there seem to be little to no consistency between them. We all know that: I know it, you know it, everybody knows it.
So before starting we are going to create some <strong>helper functions</strong> for the most useful bashML operations out there.</p>
<p>We will start with a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:fst">haskell-inspired</a> helper, <code>fst</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># a b =&gt; a</span>
fst<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>1</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>It's pretty simple: it takes the first column of a given file. By using <code>$@</code>, we can either give it a file argument or use it without arguments (think pipes) and it will <strong>Just Work™</strong>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>echo</span> -e <span>'ciao mondo\nhello world'</span> <span>|</span> fst
</pre></div>

<div><pre><span></span>fst &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> -e <span>'ciao mondo\nhello world'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you are wondering what bash does on <code>&lt;(...)</code>, look no further:</p>


<p>Long story short, bash replaces the argument with a file descriptor that's connected to the output of the command inside <code>&lt;(...)</code>.
In fact, you can also <code>cat</code> it:</p>


<p>With that out of the way, let's create some additional helpers:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Like `fst`, but returns the second column:</span>
<span># a b =&gt; b</span>
snd<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    cut -d <span>' '</span> -f <span>2</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Same as `snd`, but can handle multi-character separators:</span>
<span># a     b =&gt; b</span>
snd_awk<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    awk <span>'{ print $2 }'</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Turn whitespaces into newlines:</span>
<span># a b</span>
<span># c</span>
<span># =&gt;</span>
<span># a</span>
<span># b</span>
<span># c</span>
flat<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    tr <span>' '</span> <span>'\n'</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Similar to python `enumerate()`:</span>
<span># a</span>
<span># b</span>
<span># =&gt;</span>
<span># 0 a</span>
<span># 1 b</span>
enumerate<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    nl -v0 -w1 -s<span>' '</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span># Swap the first two columns in a file (and ignore the other columns):</span>
<span># a b =&gt; b a</span>
swap<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    awk <span>'{ print $2 " " $1 }'</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For the few of you unfamiliar with <code>tr</code>, it's a little nice utility that can <em>translate</em> single characters (aka, map one character to another) or delete a character from a stream.</p>
<p>Another nice utility is <code>nl</code>, which counts the number of lines in a file.
Don't worry too much about the options: they are just there to output the format we want.</p>
<h2>Example pipelines</h2>
<p>It's now time to test our crazy bash skills to actually do something useful.</p>
<h3>Repository similarity</h3>
<p>Let's say we want to query our repos to <strong>find Linux forks</strong> just using common strings.
We can use a scoring formula called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard index</a> (also called Jaccard similarity):</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∩</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∪</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∩</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>∩</mo><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">
J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A| + |B| - |A \cap B|}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>So, if <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are our repositories, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">J(A, B)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a measure of how many strings they share, divided by the total number of their strings.
How can you do this in bash?
Using <code>comm</code> and some basic <code>awk</code>.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with <code>comm</code>, it's a simple command that is able to compare sorted files line by line.
If you run it without any specific option it will output 3 columns formatted like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>&lt;lines unique to file 1&gt; &lt;lines unique to file 2&gt; &lt;common lines&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Remember to <strong>sort its input files</strong> otherwise <code>comm</code> will complain!</p>
<p>Anyway, if you run it with <code>--total</code>, it will also write a final line with the total count of lines for each column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>mkdir -p ./tmp/

<span># a.txt</span>
cat &gt; ./tmp/a.txt <span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>a</span>
<span>b</span>
<span>c</span>
<span>EOF</span>

<span># b.txt</span>
cat &gt; ./tmp/b.txt <span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>c</span>
<span>d</span>
<span>e</span>
<span>EOF</span>

<span># Compare the lines in a.txt and b.txt (they are already sorted!)</span>
comm --total --check-order ./tmp/a.txt ./tmp/b.txt
</pre></div>

<p>See that last line?
It's the count we were talking about.
We can throw away everything <strong>except that last line</strong>, do some simple math in <code>awk</code>, and get the Jaccard index of the input files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jaccard<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># We don't need to sort because our input files are already sorted</span>
    comm --total --check-order <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span> <span>|</span> tail -n <span>1</span> <span>|</span> awk <span>'{ print ($3 / ($3 + $2 + $1)) }'</span>
<span>}</span>
jaccard ./tmp/a.txt ./tmp/b.txt
</pre></div>

<p>Same thing, but with a different file:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># c.txt</span>
cat &gt; ./tmp/c.txt <span>&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span>b</span>
<span>c</span>
<span>d</span>
<span>EOF</span>

jaccard ./tmp/a.txt ./tmp/c.txt
</pre></div>

<p>In this examples, the first two files have only one line in common out of 5 unique strings, so <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>0.2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">J(A, B) = \frac{1}{5} = 0.2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
In the second example, they share 2 lines out of 4 unique strings, so <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>0.5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">J(A, B) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is what data scientists get paid to do by the way.</p>
<p>Now let's say we want to find the Jaccard similarity between Linux and the biggest repos in our dataset.
We need to start by getting the list of such big files:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># Get list of (size, filename)</span>
biggest_files<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    find ./dataset/ -name <span>"*.hashes.txt"</span> -print0 <span>\</span>
    <span>|</span> xargs -0 du -a <span>\</span>
    <span>|</span> sort -t <span>' '</span> -nr <span>\</span>
    <span>|</span> head -n <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>echo</span> <span>'== Biggest files =='</span>
biggest_files <span>5</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>'...'</span>
</pre></div>
<div><pre><span></span>== Biggest files ==
103288  ./dataset/mirror,dd-wrt.hashes.txt
66824   ./dataset/kishikawakatsumi,Mozc-for-iOS.hashes.txt
57564   ./dataset/mirek190,x86-android-5.0.hashes.txt
51008   ./dataset/CyberGrandChallenge,samples.hashes.txt
47068   ./dataset/AndreyPopovNew,asuswrt-merlin-rt-n.hashes.txt
...
</pre></div>
<p>We now want to use the same <code>jaccard()</code> function we defined above <strong>but</strong> we want to run it faster by exploiting <strong>parallel processing</strong>.
We can do that with GNU <code>parallel</code>.</p>
<p>GNU <code>parallel</code> has a metric ton of options.
Yes, that is 1000-kilograms-many options.
Unless you voted for Brexit or play football with your hands: in that case it's ~2205 pounds.
Since we are Europeans and are not here to start a debate about our (superior) measurement system, we will just use 2 options and ignore the others:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>cat ./tmp/a.txt <span>|</span> parallel -j<span>$(</span>nproc<span>)</span> -k -- <span>echo</span> <span>{}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>What's happening here? Quite a bit actually: <code>parallel</code> just ran <code>echo {}</code> 3 times, every time substituting <code>{}</code> with a line from the input.
Remember: the calls to <code>echo</code> happen <strong>in parallel</strong> using multiple processes!</p>
<p>GNU <code>parallel</code> allows you to use <code>{}</code> multiple times if you want:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>cat ./tmp/a.txt <span>|</span> parallel -j<span>$(</span>nproc<span>)</span> -k -- <span>echo</span> <span>{}</span> <span>{}</span> <span>{}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The options we give to <code>parallel</code> are very important: <code>-j$(nproc)</code> is for using as many processes as the processing units on the system (returned by the command <code>nproc</code>), while <code>-k</code> tells <code>parallel</code> to <strong>honor the input order</strong> when printing the output (so we don't get, e.g., <code>c c c</code> then <code>b b b</code> then <code>a a a</code>).</p>
<p>We can now use our previous <code>jaccard</code> function inside <code>parallel</code> to get the <strong>similarity between Linux and the other repos</strong>.
However, we also want a nice output so we throw in a call to <code>printf</code>.
The command gets a little messy due to string formatting, but just focus on the <code>jaccard</code> part:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>similarity<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span># Export the `jaccard` function so that it's available to `parallel`</span>
    <span>export</span> -f jaccard

    <span>echo</span> -e <span>'\n== Similarity to torvalds/linux =='</span>

    <span># Find most linux-like repos</span>
    biggest_files <span>30</span> <span>\</span>
        <span>|</span> snd_awk <span>\</span>
        <span>|</span> parallel -j<span>$(</span>nproc<span>)</span> -k -- <span>printf</span> <span>\'</span>%0.5f %s<span>\\</span>n<span>\'</span> <span>'$(jaccard ./dataset/torvalds,linux.hashes.txt {})'</span> <span>'{}'</span>
<span>}</span>

    <section>
        <p><img src="https://aberba.com/images/2020-why-use-d.png" alt="No one"></p>

<p>There are so many programming language but only a few really appeal to the
majority of developers, hence their popularity (most used) and community size
explosion. Popular languages have more hands on deck hence their
<a href="https://www.shortform.com/blog/accumulative-advantage/">Accumulative Advantage</a>:
more developers -&gt; more ideas -&gt; more contributions -&gt; more tools -&gt; more
third-party packages -&gt; more corporate support (because most of these developers
work for companies) -&gt; more apps -&gt; repeat. This very advantage gives birth to
many more advancement to the language and it’s ecosystem. As more and more
people build their businesses and tools around the language, they are
incentivize to continuously invest their engineering resources and money to
improve the overall ecosystem. Think about it 🤔</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what’s my point in relation to D?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> is a unique but still familiar language. It has almost
all the attributes suited for a mainstream programming languages. It’s
statically typed but still manages to be fluid and easy to write code in like
any dynamically typed language. It’s got all the powerful features I’ve seen in
any other language out there, either comparably similar or better. Moreover,
it’s got some of the most brilliant people behind it. This is why I’ve gone as
far to write several articles about why D is great for development including
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/5/d-open-source-software-development">this one on OpenSource.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why isn’t D mainstream?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So first of all you may ask, why is it even necessary to be mainstream or
“popular”? Isn’t staying small and nimble how we can attract quality over
quantity?</p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment to an extent but the cost definitely outweighs the
benefit. When a larger community is well managed with clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals, they can accomplish more. <strong>Clear roadmap and
communication of high-level goals</strong> ahh? Yep. That’s one of the key missing
ingredients of the D community even as small and nimble as it is. Despite the
clever language design and seemingly promising direction, D lacks in the soft
side. This is what I believe holds the grow and adoption of the language back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soft skills… the people and organizational things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a-train-with-no-destination">A train with no destination</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The roadmap of the D language is still very unclear and the project page on
GitHub has not been updated for over a year. See
https://github.com/dlang/dmd/projects</li>
  <li>There’s little to no communication of language objects and mobilization of
the community to reach certain milestones. There’s almost no organizational
side to the
<a href="https://dlang.org/foundation/about.html">D Language Foundation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why do I still use D?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>D is technically the best out there for me. It’s the only modern system
programming language with a clean and familiar syntax.</li>
  <li>It’s very powerful and capable of solving any domain problem: web
development, network applications, system development, scripting, gaming,
etc. This is rare because almost every language out there is either suited
for one thing or the other.</li>
  <li>It’s got a package system. Unless you’ve got infinite amount of time on a
project, you’ll need to use code others have written to solve similar
problems you may have. D makes it easy to discover such packages from
<a href="https://code.dlang.org/">it’s package repository</a>. Almost all modern
language have similar centralized package repositories.</li>
  <li>A great community. D has got one of the best communities I’ve ever seen. The
community is very welcoming and helpful. The only thing we lack now is
mobilization and direction.</li>
  <li>It keeps getting better. D has consistently improved over the years that
I’ve been in the community. Yes, it moves at a slow pace but it doesn’t
invalidate the fact that things keep getting better.</li>
  <li>It can be better. Comparatively, D heavily lacks in community organization,
leadership communication, development tools, third-party packages,
user-friendly documentation, learning resources, onboarding experience and
general ecosystem polish. These can make D unappealing for certain projects
with the need for a matured ecosystem. However, this can be made better.</li>
</ul>

<p>As this year comes to an end, I hope the D Language Foundation and community
revisit past mistakes and look for way to make things better. I am here to stay.</p>

<p><span>I</span>t is a myth of the West’s choosing: perpetual economic growth, advancing through a digestive system of sorts, one that uses technology as one of its core components. In its churn,<strong> </strong>ecosystems became goods; people, mere consumers. The myth turned the world into a place increasingly inhospitable to human life.</p>



<p>I write these words from the periphery of the metropolises that command this global digestive system — an enclave that resists the myth’s logic. In these parts, resistance begins with a name. Here, Latin America is neither Latin nor America; it is Abya Yala, a term the Guna people of Panama use to describe the Western Hemisphere’s largest landmass as it existed before<strong> </strong>1492. This is a territory that comprises an array of Indigenous nations, Afro-descendant communities, and societies created by political projects of miscegenation. As a whole, the history of this diverse group of peoples is inextricable from the ravages of colonialism. Yet that history has also been defined by those peoples’ ingenious use of new technologies — not as consumable goods, but as means of resisting colonial imposition in the midst of an unprecedented climate crisis.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cepal.org/en/publications/40840-science-technology-and-innovation-digital-economy-state-art-latin-america-and">To metropolitan eyes,</a> Latin America, with its minimal patent production and negligible investment in science and technology, lags behind. The Silicon Valleys springing up in different parts of the world — more an ideological concept than a geographic location — have long dismissed the region as a passive receptor for technology. But Abya Yala challenges that narrative. Here on the periphery, technology, when repurposed for resistance, can bolster the autonomy of peoples and communities.<strong> </strong>In Abya Yala, digital technologies have created virtual spaces to be shared — woven webs of sustainable<strong> </strong>collaboration among the continent’s subaltern voices.</p>



<p>This form of collaborative effort has ancient roots. To many peoples in Mexico, it is known as <em>tequio</em> (from the Náhuatl <em>tequitl</em>) or, farther south, as <em>faena</em>, <em>kol</em>, or <em>minga</em>. Through tequio, schools have been built, potable-water systems have been installed, and art has been made. Tequio has also become a strategy for meeting everyday needs. Just as the modern-day technology of free, open-source code has enabled collective progress in the digital sphere, the communal labor of tequio raises the possibility of resistance in Abya Yala — and survival of the world at large.</p>



<p>But as is true in every struggle against power, hegemonic narratives — those dominant myths that determine how we see the world<strong> </strong>— must first be confronted in order to avoid what Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Ihs241zeg&amp;ab_channel=TED">the danger of a single story</a>,” the all-encompassing Western mythology flooding our distant territories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2008, the Wayuu Film and Video Showcase, for instance, has given voice to the Wayuu, an indigenous people living in what<strong> </strong>is now<strong> </strong>Venezuela and Colombia. Similarly, the <a href="http://www.videonasaldeias.org.br/2009/">Vídeo Nas Aldeias</a> streaming platform, created by Vincent Carelli and the Nambiquara, has enabled Indigenous peoples in Brazil to learn to make films and tell their stories in their own narrative formats. The purpose of these initiatives, according to Wayuu director and film curator David Hernández Palmar, is to “close the digital gap that exists between these peoples and technology.” But “closing the gap” doesn’t only mean bringing film to the Wayuu: It also means building a bridge to the West to foster intercultural exchange.</p>



<p>Abya Yala, by repurposing imported technologies, is far ahead of the West in understanding how digital technology can burst out from the realm of the intangible into the “real world.” The West has recently witnessed how “fake news” and online interference in political disputes can spill over into its streets and ballot boxes. But Abya Yala has spent decades waging its struggles in digital spaces, particularly in defense of its native languages:<strong> </strong>Within the next hundred years, experts estimate that up to 80% of the world’s approximately 7,000 languages will have disappeared. Meanwhile, digital knowledge is accessible through just a few Portuguese-, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/saving-the-world-through-tequiology/">English</a>-, and <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/tecnologia-tequio-cambio-climatico/">Spanish</a>-language<strong> </strong>gateways, inaccessible to non-hegemonic language communities in the periphery. But groups like<strong> </strong><a href="https://rising.globalvoices.org/lenguas/"><em>Activismo Digital de Lenguas Indígenas</em></a><em> </em>are filling the void. This continent-wide digital indigenous-language movement has forged a network of activists from all over Abya Yala, including Wikipedians, app developers, and programmers, among others. Collectives like the one created in the <a href="https://rising.globalvoices.org/lenguas/2020/02/16/mozilla-en-triqui/">Triqui region of southern Mexico</a> have worked together to ensure that they have access to browsers in their own language. In this way,<strong> </strong>we see<strong> </strong>digitally underrepresented peoples appropriating technology<strong> </strong>as a tool of linguistic resistance<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abya Yala’s technological struggle<strong> </strong>also<strong> </strong>extends to the vindication of material sovereignty. In Mexico, <a href="https://www.redesac.org.mx/telefoniacomunitaria">Community Cellular Technology</a>, through which cell phone systems are locally owned, administered, and operated, has been built against a backdrop that has started to crumble: As proprietors of their own cell company, these communities defy the slogan of the conglomerate that controls 70% of the country’s mobile communication services: “All of Mexico is Telcel territory.” The response from these communities is No: Not all of Mexico is the territory of Carlos Slim, one of the wealthiest men in the world. They strive for technological sovereignty.</p>



<p>Technology has also tapped into ancient collective philosophies to resist the metropole. Rodrigo Pérez Ramírez, better known in Mexico as Zapoteco 3.0, is part of the <a href="https://mozillanativo.org/involucrate">Mozilla Nativo</a> movement, which seeks to empower indigenous peoples online. He told me that he had found in open-source software a natural ally to his local Zapotec-language activism. There is a serendipitous affinity between the logic of collective effort and free cooperation that defines open-source software like Linux and the philosophy of many indigenous communities who built structures to survive the harshness of colonial rule. Both rely on<strong> </strong>mutual support and small-scale, community-level labor linked into a circuit of larger tasks.<strong> </strong>Such tequio is an essential “social technology” common<strong> </strong>across Abya Yala. It has been<strong> </strong>for a long time, including back when indigenous peoples, organized into small communities, created networks to resist paying taxes or to plan rebellions against the Iberian crowns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this form of scalable Abya Yalan tequio could be a crucial asset to the entire world in the years ahead. When technologies are deployed in forms<strong> </strong>that resemble<strong> </strong>tequio,<strong> </strong>rather than in pursuit of insatiable competitive growth, we may indeed get a true solution to the dire climate emergency we are facing. Even so-called green capitalism has raised hopes that some technological invention will solve our ecological emergency. But we in Abya Yala can see how even some forms of renewable energy wind up as just another pollutant. Here, we have seen<strong> </strong>rare earths violently <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/niobium-the-mighty-element-youve-never-heard-of/">extracted from our territories</a> in order to create “green technologies,” which are then installed on “empty land” by dispossessing our communities.<strong> </strong>This phenomenon was explored at the Wayuu Film and Video Showcase in a documentary called “Tatuushi”<em> </em>(My Grandfather). Through traditional Wayuu singing, it tells the story of a grandfather who travels to the city in search of food. On his return, he finds that coal companies have devastated his land and destroyed his home. Faced with dispossession, the grandfather responds with a traditional prayer.</p>



<p>An alternative, offered by Abya Yala, lies in separating economic development and the development of new technologies from consumerism. This would place technological creation and ingenuity once again at the service of the common good, not of the market. Technology as tequio; technological creation and innovation as a common good. A kind of open-source software we can all participate in, just as we have participated in the construction of our lives as the colonized peoples of this continent, resisting genocide and extinction.&nbsp;In the face of our current global climate emergency, we need to foster forms of technological development that emphasize living with dignity, not infinite economic growth as an end in itself. We must focus on technologies based on collaborative labor more than on competition. As peoples of Abya Yala, we’re experienced in this strategy, which I call <em>tequiology</em>. If the world were to listen to the people of Abya Yala and adopt this new tequiological vision, we could perhaps escape the digestive system that so threatens our world’s climate and endangers human life.</p>

<p>Let’s discuss common ways to handle errors in OCaml, their shortcomings, and finally, how polymorphic variants may help. The discussion applies equally well to <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/">Reason ML</a>.</p>
<p>If you need an introduction to the topic, I recommend Real World OCaml chapter on <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/error-handling.html">Error Handling</a>.</p>
<p>As a reference point, we’ll take three hypothetical functions which can return errors and which we want to compose:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Parser.parse</code>, which can yield a “syntax error” or a “grammar error”.</li>
<li><code>Validation.perform</code>, which can yield a “length error” or a “height error”.</li>
<li><code>Display.render</code>, which can yield a “display error”.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover the following error-handling approaches:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>
Exceptions for errors
</li>
<li>
Result type with strings for errors
</li><li>
Result type with custom variants for errors
</li><li>
Result type with polymorphic variants for errors
</li></ol>
<h2 id="a.-exceptions-for-errors">A. Exceptions for errors</h2>
<p>First, let us consider a version of our interface where the above functions use exceptions to signal errors.</p>

<p>Here is how we can write code that composes these functions while ignoring the errors:</p>

<p>And here is how we can write code that handles and reports each error:</p>

<p><em>Upsides:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composition</strong>. Functions compose freely.</li>
<li><strong>Concern separation</strong>. Happy path and error handling are separated.</li>
<li><strong>Distinguishable errors</strong>. We can reliably distinguish one kind of error from another–for example, a <code>SyntaxError</code> from a <code>GrammarError</code>.</li>
<li>Also, in OCaml, the exception mechanism is fast and fits well with performance-critical sections of code.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Downsides:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No <strong>error contract</strong>. Comment on a function signature is our only hope to know that a function can raise as well as which exact exceptions it can raise. Nothing can save us from a comment that is missing, incorrect, or out-of-date. We could use a popular naming convention and name our function <code>Parser.parse_exn</code>. This is definitely worthwhile, but similar shortcomings apply.</li>
<li>No <strong>exhaustiveness checking</strong>. We cannot be sure that we handled all the error cases at a relevant call site or that the cases we are covering are relevant at all. If we change one of the called functions to return a new kind of error, then the compiler will not inform us about the call sites that are affected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the flaws of the exception-based approach are real and dire, it is important to recognize the upsides to adequately compare this approach with the other.</p>
<h2 id="b.-result-type-with-strings-for-errors">B. Result type with strings for errors</h2>
<p>The OCaml built-in <code>Stdlib.result</code> type provides a reusable way to express and distinguish a success value and an error value.</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>type</span> ('success, 'error) result =</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  | Ok <span>of</span> 'success</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  | Error <span>of</span> 'error</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since version 4.08, OCaml contains a <code>Result</code> module that contains helper functions to operate on the result type.</p>
<p>One way to use the result type is to use a string for the <code>'error</code> parameter, that describes the error textually. This way, our interface will look like this:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>module</span> Parser : <span>sig</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>  <span>val</span> parse : <span>string</span> -&gt; (tree, <span>string</span>) result</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a><span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5"></a><span>module</span> Validation : <span>sig</span></span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6"></a>  <span>val</span> perform : tree -&gt; (tree, <span>string</span>) result</span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7"></a><span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9"></a><span>module</span> Display : <span>sig</span></span>
<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10"></a>  <span>val</span> render : tree -&gt; (<span>string</span>, <span>string</span>) result</span>
<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We could handle errors by manually matching on the result type:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>let</span> main source =</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>  <span>match</span> Parser.parse source <span>with</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3"></a>  | Error message -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4"></a>      eprintf <span>"Parser error: %s"</span> message</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5"></a>  | Ok tree -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6"></a>      <span>match</span> Validation.perform tree <span>with</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7"></a>      | Error message -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8"></a>          eprintf <span>"Validation error: %s"</span> message</span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9"></a>      | Ok tree -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10"></a>          <span>match</span> Display.render tree <span>with</span></span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11"></a>          | Error message -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12"></a>              eprintf <span>"Display error: %s"</span> message</span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13"></a>          | Ok <span>output</span> -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb6-14"><a href="#cb6-14"></a>              printf <span>"%s"</span> <span>output</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Or we could use <code>Result.bind</code> to monadically compose the result-returning functions and thus separate error handling from the happy path.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>let</span> main source =</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>  Result.bind (Parser.parse source) (<span>fun</span> tree -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>    Result.bind (Validation.perform tree) (<span>fun</span> tree -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>      Display.render tree))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, it is more common to use an infix operator <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> for <code>bind</code>:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a><span>let</span> (&gt;&gt;=) = Result.bind</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a><span>let</span> main source =</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4"></a>  Parser.parse source &gt;&gt;= <span>fun</span> tree -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5"></a>  Validation.perform tree &gt;&gt;= <span>fun</span> tree -&gt;</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6"></a>  Display.render tree</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since OCaml 4.08 you can also use binding operators:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a><span>let</span> (<span>let</span><span>*)</span> = Result.bind</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3"></a><span>let</span> main source =</span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4"></a>  <span>let</span>* tree = Parse.parse source <span>in</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5"></a>  <span>let</span>* tree = Validation.perform tree <span>in</span></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6"></a>  Display.render tree</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice how similar this looks to our original version based on exceptions:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a><span>let</span> main source =</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>  <span>let</span> tree = Parser.parse source <span>in</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>  <span>let</span> tree = Validation.perform tree <span>in</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4"></a>  Display.render tree</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In both cases we can handle the errors separately from the happy path:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a><span>let</span> handle_errors source =</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2"></a>  <span>match</span> main source <span>with</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3"></a>  | Error message -&gt; eprintf <span>"Error: %s"</span> message</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4"></a>  | Ok <span>output</span> -&gt; printf <span>"%s"</span> <span>output</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>Upsides:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Composition</strong>. Functions compose using the result monad.</li>
<li><strong>Concern separation</strong>. The error handling and the happy-path code can be separated.</li>
<li><strong><em>Weak</em> error contract</strong>. The fact that a function can return an error is part of the type signature. However, we can’t infer which exact errors are part of the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Downsides:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-<strong>distinguishable errors</strong>. At the site where we handle errors we can’t distinguish two errors, for example, a “length error” from a “height error”.</li>
<li>No <strong>exhaustiveness checking</strong>. When a new error case is introduced, the compiler will not help us find the call sites where a change would be relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared with <em>A. Exceptions for errors</em> approach, we lose the ability to distinguish errors, maintain the ability to compose functions, and gain the ability to know from a type signature that a function can return an error.</p>
<h2 id="c.-result-type-with-custom-variants-for-errors">C. Result type with custom variants for errors</h2>
<p>A natural way to improve upon the previous example would be to use the result type with a custom variant type for the <code>'error</code> type parameter instead of string:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1"></a><span>module</span> Parser : <span>sig</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2"><a href="#cb12-2"></a>  <span>type</span> error =</span>

<span id="cb12-19"><a href="#cb12-19"></a><span>end</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can handle errors by manually matching on the result type:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1"></a><span>let</span> main source =</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2"></a>  <span>match</span> Parser.parse source <span>with</span></span>

<span id="cb13-11"><a href="#cb13-11"></a>          eprintf <span>"length %d is out of bounds"</span> length</span>

<span id="cb13-20"><a href="#cb13-20"></a>              printf <span>"%s"</span> <span>output</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, if we try to compose the three functions monadically (like we did in the previous example), we discover that it is not possible because the bind operator requires the <code>'error</code> type parameters of different functions to unify (notably, unlike the <code>'success</code> type parameter):</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1"></a><span>val</span> bind : ('a, 'error) result</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2"></a>        -&gt; ('a -&gt; ('b, 'error) result)</span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3"></a>        -&gt; ('b, 'error) result</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>Upsides:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error contract</strong>. The type—not a comment—reflects the relevant error cases.</li>
<li><strong>Distinguishable errors</strong>. We can pattern-match to distinguish errors.</li>
<li><strong>Exhaustiveness checking</strong>. When the called function gets an additional error case, the compiler will show all the call sites that need to be updated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Downsides:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No <strong>composition</strong>. We can’t compose the functions directly, monadically, or otherwise.</li>
<li>No <strong>concern separation</strong>. We are forced to deal with the error branch using pattern matching or combinators.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a way to work around the two downsides. You can lift each function you want to compose to a result type where <code>'error</code> can encompass all the possible errors in your combined expression. However, that adds boilerplate per each function and requires to manage the new “large” error type.</p>
<p>Compared with <em>B. Result type with strings for errors</em> approach, we lose composition (wich is a big deal), mix up the happy path with error handling, but regain the ability to distinguish and exhaustively check error cases, while having a strong error contract.</p>
<p>Seems like you can’t have the cake and eat it too. This is also usually the point where best practices of other statically-typed functional languages stop, and you have to deal with the trade-offs.</p>
<h2 id="d.-result-type-with-polymorphic-variants-for-errors">D. Result type with polymorphic variants for errors</h2>
<p>Polymorphic variants allow you to have the cake and eat it too. Here’s how.</p>

<p>One of the questions I often come back to is this: how much of our collective wealth is inherited by our generations versus created by our generations?</p>

<p>I realized that the keys on the keyboard in front of me might make a good dataset to attack that problem. So I built a small little <a href="https://breckyunits.com/files/keyboard/">experiment to explore the history of the keys on my keyboard</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-five-waves-of-symbols">The Five Waves of Symbols</h2>

<p>Painting with broad strokes, there were approximately five big waves of inventions that have left their mark on the keyboard. The first wave was the invention of the phonetic alphabet letters. The second wave was the Hindu-Arabic Numerals. The third wave was the mathematical punctuation of the Enlightenment period. The fourth wave was the invention of the typewriter. And the fifth and most recent wave was the invention of the personal computer.</p>

<p>I haven’t made any traditional charts yet with this dataset, but you can roughly make out these waves in the interactive visualization by moving the slider around.</p>

<h2 id="concentric-circles">Concentric Circles</h2>

<p>An interesting pattern that I never saw before is how the five waves above are roughly arranged in circles. The oldest symbols (letters) are close to the center, followed by the Hindu-Arabic Numbers, surrounded by the punctuation of the Englightenment, surrounded by the keys of the keyboard, surrounded by the recent additions in the P.C. era. Again, painting with broad strokes, but I found that to be an interesting pattern.</p>

<h2 id="standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants">Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h2>

<p>All of these waves happened invented before my generation. Almost all of them before any generation alive today. The keyboard dataset provides strong evidence that most of our collective wealth is inherited.</p>

<h2 id="build-notes">Build Notes</h2>

<p>I got this idea last week and couldn’t get it out of my head. Yesterday I took a quick crack at it. I didn’t have much time to spare, just enough to explore the big ideas. I started by typing all the characters on my keyboard into a Tree Notation document. Then I dug up some years for a handful of the symbols. Then I found the great Apple CSS keyboard. I stitched together the two and it seemed to be at least mildly interesting so I opted to continue. I then flushed out most of the dataset. Finally I played around with a number of visualization effects. At first I thought heatmaps would work well, and tried a few variations on that, but wasn’t happy with anything. I posted my work-in-progress to a few friends last night and called it a day. Today I switched to the “disappearing keys” visualization. That definitely felt like a better approach than the heatmap. I made the thing as fun as I could given time constraints and then shipped.</p>

          <p>In this post, I will guide you through the steps needed to design your database schema using TerminusDB 4.0 Console and its model builder.</p>

<p>Having your data in the right format makes it easier to analyze the data properly but you can model your data in more than one way. This is a reality for all the databases, so how to make the right decision?</p>

<p>The model builder is a tool that lets you visualize and edit your database schema. It is very useful for designing and understanding complex data models.
I’ll show you how you can start from a simple model and build out something more complex in no time.</p>

<p>if you have never used TerminusDB before, this article includes everything you need to get started with TerminusDB. <a href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/2020/09/01/my-first-terminusdb-3-0-graph-bike-share-data/">My First TerminusDB Graph Visualisation — Bike Share Data</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h3>

<p>In our examples we use the collection of data about the bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C., USA.</p>

<p>We have used this data in other blogs, where with woql.js, a javascript layer that help you to compose <a href="https://terminusdb.com/docs/reference/server/woql/"><strong>WOQL query</strong> (Web Object Query Language)</a>, we have created our database scheme.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/bike_table.png" alt="data about the bike journeys between stations in Washington D.C"></p>

<p>The CSV data used this tutorial is available at <a href="https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv">https://terminusdb.com/t/data/bike_tutorial.csv</a></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="how-do-i-model-my-schema-using-the-model-builder">How do I model my schema using the model builder?</h3>

<p>I assume you already have TerminusDB and Console running in your system 
and you have created a db named <strong>myBikes</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-02.png" alt="Go to model builder"></p>

<p>Form the <strong>myBikes</strong> main page.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the menu <strong>Schema-&gt;Schema Builder</strong> to arrive at the model builder interface.</li>
  <li>In the whiteboard select the node <strong>myBikes Schema</strong>, the list of all available node types will show up.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-03.png" alt="See the whiteboard"></p>

<p>Let’s see the different nodes in detail.</p>

<p><strong>Object</strong> contains a piece of the graph and can be accessed by a unique url.
An Object can have multiple properties and can be contained inside other objects.</p>

<p><strong>Document</strong> is a special type of Object. Documents are always top-level objects, never embedded inside other objects, using the Link Property you can link documents to each other.</p>

<p><strong>Enum</strong> or Enumerated is a special data type that enables a property to be a set of predefined constants. The property must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it. To use this set of values you’ll need to create an Enum Property and link it to an Emun Element.</p>

<p>Let’s use these elements in practice.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-nodes">Add Nodes</h3>

<p>For storing our data we have to create 3 different Documents  <strong>Bicycle</strong>, <strong>Station</strong> and <strong>Journey</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-04.png" alt="Node List"></p>

<p>Follow the steps and start to build your schema graph.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>myBikes Schema</strong> node in the whiteboard and click the + icon</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Add Document</strong> from the menu. A new node will be added under the node <strong>Documents</strong></li>
  <li>We start to add <strong>Bicycle</strong> Document. Fill the form in the right sidebar with the data from the image above. (Unique Id:Bicycle..)</li>
  <li>Follow the same steps above for adding the other Documents <strong>Station</strong> and <strong>Journey</strong></li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> icon button in the tools bar to save your work.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>At this point our documents are completely unrelated.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-05.png" alt="Documents"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-properties">Add Properties</h3>

<p>To descrive your Documents and to link them with each other, we need to add properties to our documents.
We have various different type of properties identified by datatypes</p>

<p>DataProperty : String/Numeric/Geo/Temporal Property refers to the format of data storage</p>

<p>ObjectProperty : Enum/Link Property refers to a relationship between elements</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-06.png" alt="Property list"></p>

<p>Let’s add the property <strong>start_station</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the node <strong>Journey</strong> in the whiteboard, in the right panel click on the <strong>Properties</strong></li>
  <li>In the properties panel, click <strong>Add Property</strong> in the pop up menu you can see the list of the available property types.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Property Link</strong> after the form shows up, fill the fields with the value reported in the table above (Unique ID/Label/Description).</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Link to Type</strong> menu and Select <strong>Bike Station</strong> 
  <em>Links to Type is a list with all the node that you can linked</em></li>
  <li>Follow the step 1 to 4 for adding the others properties <strong>end_station</strong>, <strong>journey_bicycle</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-07.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Save</strong> icon button in the tools bar to save your work.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>Relationships</strong> in the right panel top bar to see the links.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>We have created our relationship beetween Documents.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-08.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="schema-evolution-and-compatibility">Schema Evolution and Compatibility</h3>

<p>An important aspect of data management is schema evolution. 
My initial schema is defined, but my application now need to change it, what can I do?</p>

<p>Let’s see.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-09.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<p>Now we need to model the Document <strong>Station</strong> as Object, so we have to delete the Document <strong>Station</strong> and create a new node type.</p>

<p>The database doesn’t allow you to delete a node if it is related with another node.
More precisely the node can not have children and it can not be the range of a Link Property/Enum 
Property.
This constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy the integrity of the data model.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="delete-a-node">Delete a Node</h3>

<p>Here the step for doing this.
First we have to remove all the relationship related to our node.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-10.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the Document <strong>Journey</strong> node in the whiteboard, in the right panel Select <strong>Properties</strong>. the list of the properties will show up.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>End Station</strong> Property and delete it using the red delete icon.</li>
  <li>Follow the above steps for deleting <strong>Start Station</strong> Property too.</li>
  <li>All the <strong>Station</strong> node constraints have been removed</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Station</strong> node in the whiteboard, in the right panel, Click the delete red icon.</li>
</ol>

<p>Deleting a node is easy at this stage because we don’t have any data in the database.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-an-object-type">Add an Object Type</h3>

<p>Now we add the <strong>Station</strong> node as Object Type.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Schema myBikes</strong>, click on the + icon, from the menu Select <strong>Add Object</strong> a new node will be add in the whiteboard.</li>
  <li>As we did before we have to add the Unique ID/Station and the Label/Description Bike Station in the fields in the right panel.</li>
  <li>Select the Node <strong>Journey</strong> and add the Link Property <strong>Start Station</strong> <strong>End Station</strong> again (Follow the add property steps above).</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-11.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="difference-between-object-and-document-types">Difference between Object and Document Types</h3>

<p>The difference in Linking a Property to a Document than a Object is in how this data will be represented and managed in document form.</p>

<p>Here is an example with bike data</p>

<p>If <strong>Station</strong> is a Document Type you have to create a <strong>Station</strong> Document <br>
and link the id of the Document <strong>Station</strong> with the <strong>Journey</strong> Document</p>

<p>This means that if you remove one <strong>Journey</strong> Document 
it removes the link but not the data in the related <strong>Station</strong> document.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the <strong>Station</strong> is an Object Type, its data will be embedded in the <strong>Journey</strong> Document 
So if you remove one Journey Document entry it will be remove the related <strong>Station</strong>
Object.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-an-enum-node">Add an Enum Node</h3>

<p>We continue our Schema evolution by adding the <strong>Type Bike</strong> enum node</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-12.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Schema myBikes</strong>, Select the + icon, from the menu Select <strong>Add Enum</strong></li>
  <li>The Enum node will be added in the whiteboard</li>
  <li>Fill the fields in the right panel (Unique Id:Bike_Type..)</li>
  <li>Select values, Fill the fields and click the button <strong>Add a value</strong> for adding the list of possible values</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3 id="link-the-enum-node-with-the-enum-property">Link the Enum Node with the Enum Property</h3>

<p>We are going to create our Enum property for the <strong>Bicycle</strong> Documents</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Bicycle</strong> node</li>
  <li>In the right panel, Select the <strong>Properties</strong> tab</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Add Property</strong> menu and Click <strong>Enum Property</strong></li>
  <li>Fill the Property fields in the Property panel (Unique ID:bicycle_type ….)</li>
  <li>From the <strong>Enum Type</strong> menu Select <strong>Bike Type</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>We said that the property <strong>Bicycle Type</strong> in <strong>Bicycle</strong> Document is a string with a value chosen from a list of permitted values.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-13.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-children">Add Children</h3>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-14.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<p>We are going to add other elements to create a more complex hierarchy</p>

<p>At this point in our project we need to add information about the bike user, we suppose we can have 2 types of user that rent the bike, a registered user and a guest user.</p>

<p>First we create an abstract Document <strong>User</strong> for grouping the different type of user.</p>

<p>An Abstract Document is a completely “abstract class” that is used to group related properties.</p>

<p>Abstract Documents cannot be used to create Data directly, you cannot add data in a <strong>User</strong>
Document. An abstract Document can have children, all the children will inherit all the parent’s properties and if the children are not abstract, you can insert data as children.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-15.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<p>Let’s see all the steps for creating an abstract document and its children.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <strong>Document</strong> node in the whiteboard, Select the + icon and from the menu that show up, Choose <strong>Add Document</strong>.</li>
  <li>A new node Document will be added.</li>
  <li>In the right panel fill the fields for the new Document (Unique ID:User, Label:Bike User….)</li>
  <li>Check the <strong>Abstract</strong> checkbox.</li>
  <li>Select the tab <strong>Properties</strong>, from the menu <strong>Add Property</strong> Choose <strong>String Property</strong></li>
  <li>The String Property Panel will show up, fill the fields (Unique ID: email, Label:Email)
<img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-16.png" alt="Property start_station"></li>
  <li>Choose <strong>Email</strong> from the <strong>String Type</strong> menu.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Cardinality Min</strong> field add 1 (this means that if you add an User Document, the email property must have a value in it).</li>
</ol>

<p><em>we added the Abstract <strong>User</strong> Document with its properties, now let’s add the children.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the node <strong>Bike User</strong> in the whiteboard, Click on the + icon, from the menu Select <strong>Add Child</strong></li>
  <li>A new Node will be added, in the right panel fill all the fields (Unique Id:Guest ….)</li>
  <li>Follow the above steps for add the <strong>Member</strong> Document too</li>
</ol>

<p>We can decide to not add new properties in the Guest document so the guest user will be identified by the email, but for the <strong>Member</strong> Document we need to add at least the String property Password.</p>

<p>We have to create a Link Property <strong>Bicycle User</strong> in the <strong>Bike Journey</strong> Document for link the <strong>User</strong> Document with the <strong>Bike Journey</strong> Document.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-17.png" alt="Property start_station"></p>

<hr>

<h3 id="add-a-parent">Add a Parent</h3>

<p>At this point of our project we want to reorganize our nodes.</p>

<p>We have to create an element that can be <strong>a Parent</strong> for an Object node and a Document node. 
Objects can only be children of Object types, Documents can be children of Object Types and Document Types, so we have to create a <strong>New Object Node</strong></p>

<p>We can call this node <strong>Entity</strong>. The <strong>Entity</strong> node is abstract and has a Geo Property  <strong>Position</strong></p>

<p>I am sure you already know all the steps for doing this 😊.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/images/schema_builder-18.png" alt="Add Parent"></p>

<p>Let’s group <strong>Bike Station</strong> and <strong>Bicycle</strong> under this new node.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the node <strong>Bicycle</strong> in the whiteboard, in the right panel Select <strong>Relationships</strong></li>
  <li>Under <strong>Add/Remove Parents</strong> panel from the menu …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

Einblick is launching the first visual data computing platform that fundamentally changes how users interact with data by providing the fastest way to understand the past, predict the future and make the best data-driven decisions for their business.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Sunil Dhaliwal, General Partner at Amplify Partners, joins Einblick’s board of directors. The funding will be used to continue investing in building a world-class engineering team, as well as expanding its sales and marketing capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>“Organizations are challenged by making data-driven decisions to achieve the best business outcome,” said Tim Kraska, Founder and CEO at Einblick. “With Einblick’s visual data computing platform, business analysts and data scientists in organizations of all sizes can&nbsp;analyze past data, build predictive models and simulate scenarios all in the same platform to quickly make data-driven decisions.”</p><p>“Our research shows that it is still very difficult for organizations to develop and evaluate descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics,” said David Menninger, SVP and Research Director at Ventana Research. “In this changing economic climate, a visual computing platform that makes these capabilities more accessible is critical to enable users to collaborate and make quick data-driven decisions.”</p><p>Early Einblick customers report significant benefits. A global manufacturer is using the visual data computing platform to accurately identify root causes of product quality defects in manufacturing production lines and to reveal key drivers for employee retention. A global internet provider has used it to compare network performance and outages across geographies to predict service disruptions and proactively resolve them. Uniquely, across all early customers, Einblick has allowed organizations to optimize decision making by bringing together analysts and business stakeholders.</p><p><strong>How Einblick’s Visual Data Computing Platform Works</strong></p><p>Einblick is a visually interactive data collaboration environment that data scientists and analysts can use to understand the meaning hidden in their data. Traditional analytic tools are not collaborative and are focused solely on either descriptive analytics (traditionally business intelligence tools), predictive analytics (typically self-service data science tools) or prescriptive analytics (nascent market with few providers). Einblick provides an integrated environment for descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics with the following key features:</p><ul><li>Einblick’s descriptive analytics enables users to quickly integrate new data, correlate it with existing data, clean it and explore it. Key driver analysis assists users in finding out what really happened.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Einblick’s advanced AutoML predictive analytic capability reveals the potential impact of changes in the business by building models quickly and easily.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="d46e">Style transfer model download</h2><p id="59a5">In the previous tutorial, once our model had finished training in Fritz AI, I decided to proceed by downloading the Lens Studio project template file. This allowed me to prototype quickly, as the template structure made hooking up the ML Component to the Lens really simple.</p><p id="897f">In this case, however, I want to start working with a different templateâ€”the primary Segmentation template provided by Snapchat. This means using the project template provided by Fritz AI wonâ€™t work. Instead, Iâ€™ll need to download just the model file and manually configure it inside the Segmentation template.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*YGx3gHuhqYidRRCccxfEMg.gif" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*YGx3gHuhqYidRRCccxfEMg.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YGx3gHuhqYidRRCccxfEMg.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*YGx3gHuhqYidRRCccxfEMg.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*YGx3gHuhqYidRRCccxfEMg.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><blockquote><p id="a5fe">Note the link to documentation in the model download prompt in the above gifâ€”this can be helpful to review if youâ€™re uncertain about next steps.</p></blockquote><p id="99a3">While Iâ€™ll still have to configure this model file manually in Lens Studio, Fritz AI does all the heavy ML lifting for youâ€”the model is in the correct format, with an optimized model architecture, and has inputs and outputs formatted</p><h2 id="2af0">Working with the Lens Studio Segmentation template</h2><p id="de36">Now that I have my ML model file downloaded (.onnx format), I can start putting the pieces together inside Lens Studio.</p><p id="f2d4">Upon opening the Segmentation template in Lens Studio, I see the following:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="5a82">As we can clearly see here, this template already has the human subject separated (or segmented) from the background of the scene. And with that separation, we have a very simple heart AR effect currently occupying the background.</p><p id="63ac">Note that, by default, the template opens with the Segmentation Controller (a script, essentially) opened in the Inspector on the right hand side.</p><p id="103c">So what I need to do here, ins essence, is replace the heart AR effect with the output of my style transfer model. The first step here is to add a new ML Component Object that will contain this model.</p><h2 id="742a">Adding an ML Component Object</h2><p id="ed3e">To add an ML Component, I simply click the â€˜+â€™ icon in the Objects panel (top left) and either scroll down to or search for <code>ML Component</code>.</p><p id="b9cc">Upon selection, a Finder window pops up (Iâ€™m using a MacBook)â€”this is where Iâ€™ll select the .onnx file I downloaded in the previous step. Upon selecting this model, a Model Import dialogue box will open that allows you to modify model inputs and outputs.</p><p id="e37f">Fritz AI models have these inputs and outputs generically configured to be compatible with Lens Studio, but there are some use cases where experimentation might make sense (a bit more on that later)â€”so for simplicityâ€™s sake, Iâ€™ll leave everything as is and click â€œImportâ€�.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*15dMAYrJCPvbCkcgafcsOw.gif" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*15dMAYrJCPvbCkcgafcsOw.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*15dMAYrJCPvbCkcgafcsOw.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*15dMAYrJCPvbCkcgafcsOw.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*15dMAYrJCPvbCkcgafcsOw.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="cb81">Parts of the above gif are difficult to make out, and I want to point you to a couple of different things here, as I prepare to try to hook up the two ML tasks.</p><p id="eff9">First, note that the ML Component is automatically nested under the <code>Camera</code> Object in the top left panel. This seems to allow the Component to communicate with this primary camera:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/892/1*Js9oWG3AlG7vpcB7rk6IrA.png" width="446" height="435" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Js9oWG3AlG7vpcB7rk6IrA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/892/1*Js9oWG3AlG7vpcB7rk6IrA.png 446w" sizes="446px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Js9oWG3AlG7vpcB7rk6IrA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="6c02">Second, the ML Component configuration. Note that, upon adding the style transfer model to the ML Component, I donâ€™t have anything set in terms of the input and output Textures.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1252/1*EqGLzi-HuwDYqj0g-5oPWw.png" width="626" height="450" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*EqGLzi-HuwDYqj0g-5oPWw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*EqGLzi-HuwDYqj0g-5oPWw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1252/1*EqGLzi-HuwDYqj0g-5oPWw.png 626w" sizes="626px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*EqGLzi-HuwDYqj0g-5oPWw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="0d95">This means Iâ€™ll have to adjust these textures in order to allow the camera to provide the model input (i.e. the scene), and the component to provide the Lens the output (the altered style). To do this, Iâ€™ll follow the same steps as in the previous tutorial, which are as follows:</p><ol><li id="0c82">In the Inspector under the modelâ€™s Inputs, change the value of <code>Texture</code> from <code>None</code> to <code>Default Textures</code> â†’<code>Device Camera Texture</code>. This will feed the camera input to your model.</li><li id="33e5">Create an output texture for your model by clicking the <code>Create Output Texture Button</code> under the Outputs menu. Lens Studio will automatically create this output Texture.</li></ol><p id="0eb9">Hereâ€™s how this looks in practice:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*tyOIa4As3Gy11mQhuxbeZg.gif" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tyOIa4As3Gy11mQhuxbeZg.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tyOIa4As3Gy11mQhuxbeZg.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*tyOIa4As3Gy11mQhuxbeZg.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*tyOIa4As3Gy11mQhuxbeZg.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="0dec">Previously, this was all I needed to do to get the ML Component working and adding the modelâ€™s artistic style to the camera scene. However, as youâ€™ll notice here, nothing changes when I configure the ML Component.</p><p id="e57d">This is because the Segmentation Controller (the script I referred to earlier) is the primary Object thatâ€™s currently communicating with the camera/scene. To change that, Iâ€™ll need to change the Segmentation Controller so that instead of applying these hearts to the background, itâ€™s instead applying the ML Componentâ€™s style transfer output (i.e. the artistic style itself).</p><h2 id="85d1">Configuring the Segmentation Controller</h2><p id="ed16">To configure the Segmentation Controller, Iâ€™ll complete a somewhat similar process as I did with the ML Componentâ€”namely, Iâ€™ll configure both an input (i.e. an <code>Image</code>) and an output (in this case, a <code>Post Effect</code>).</p><blockquote><p id="b5bd">Note: The above might not be the correct technical terminology, but itâ€™s been helpful to me to think of this process as editing the Controllers inputs and outputs.</p></blockquote><p id="0a3f">Because I ultimately want the segmented background to display the real life scene with the artistic style overlaid on top of it, I want the Segmentation Controller to use the device camera as its input source. So to do this, Iâ€™ll change the <code>Image</code> to <code>Device Camera Texture</code>, much like I did in the last step.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*TO98Tiootkrn4843uNR4qg.gif" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TO98Tiootkrn4843uNR4qg.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TO98Tiootkrn4843uNR4qg.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*TO98Tiootkrn4843uNR4qg.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*TO98Tiootkrn4843uNR4qg.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="562f">Note that Iâ€™ve also unchecked â€œUse Background Colorâ€�, which eliminates the pale pink that was serving as the background color palette. Iâ€™m not sure if this really does anything for this use case, but there seemed to be no reason to keep this in place.</p><p id="b3d6">I was kind of startled the first time I saw the tiled panel of the human subject floating in the background. But upon closer inspection, this makes senseâ€”with the hearts and the background color stripped away, the device camera is simply capturing this person against a neutral background.</p><p id="b7b2">Itâ€™s still, however, configured to include this floating tile effect. We can see this in the Controller config:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1250/1*WVkTEUqQyxPMHPMjLcK3mQ.png" width="625" height="426" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*WVkTEUqQyxPMHPMjLcK3mQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*WVkTEUqQyxPMHPMjLcK3mQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1250/1*WVkTEUqQyxPMHPMjLcK3mQ.png 625w" sizes="625px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*WVkTEUqQyxPMHPMjLcK3mQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="5d6b">Because of the way this template is set up, this <code>Tiled</code> option is checked â€” thatâ€™s why upon launch, the heart asset was copied across a floating grid that was configured in the <code>Tiled Settings</code> to scroll at a certain speed with a certain density of hearts, etc.</p><p id="9e15">As such, the next step is to uncheck this option. Upon doing so, the preview panel shows what looks like the most basic starter test image:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*ahHJSxpl7bosxbaK5GvDbg.png" width="300" height="535" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ahHJSxpl7bosxbaK5GvDbg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*ahHJSxpl7bosxbaK5GvDbg.png 300w" sizes="300px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/34/1*ahHJSxpl7bosxbaK5GvDbg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="3d70">But not to worry! This next step is where all the pieces come together.</p><h2 id="9d06">Adding the ML Component Output as a Post Effect</h2><p id="6c8e">This final step took me quite a while to figure out and didnâ€™t seem quite as intuitive as the others. And while there might be other ways to apply the style transfer effect to the isolated background that Iâ€™m unaware of, Iâ€™ll get this working by adding a <code>Post Effect</code> that leverages the ML Component.</p><p id="5f04">Iâ€™ll also edit this in the Segmentation Controller Object:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1244/1*FWXO-EbP8opyvunm5LheQA.png" width="622" height="427" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*FWXO-EbP8opyvunm5LheQA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*FWXO-EbP8opyvunm5LheQA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1244/1*FWXO-EbP8opyvunm5LheQA.png 622w" sizes="622px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*FWXO-EbP8opyvunm5LheQA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="57d5">Once I enable a <code>Post Effect</code> I can configure its Texture and Alpha value (intensity of the effect).</p><p id="6947">The final step here is to add the Output Texture of the ML Component (the auto-generated <code>Iambda Proxy Texture</code>) as the <code>Post Effect Texture</code>. This is how the ML Component ultimately hooks up to the overall segmentation effect and allows the style to overlay on the sceneâ€™s background.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*LgM-tESBSqLFZtBOvcWbmA.gif" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*LgM-tESBSqLFZtBOvcWbmA.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*LgM-tESBSqLFZtBOvcWbmA.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*LgM-tESBSqLFZtBOvcWbmA.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*LgM-tESBSqLFZtBOvcWbmA.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="db3c">As you can see in the gif, setting the <code>Iambda Proxy Texture</code> as the <code>Post Effect Texture</code> adds the style transfer output to the segmented background.</p><p id="b9bf">At first, I wasnâ€™t entirely sure if this was actually going to work fully. The color palette seemed to be there, but how would it translate to a scene with objects and furniture and whatever else?</p><p id="8338">There are a couple ways to test this. My go-to is to just <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/guides/general/previewing-your-lens/" rel="noopener">send the Lens to my device to test it out</a>. Alternatively, you can change the Segmentation Controller <code>Image Texture</code> to a photograph that will serve as the background in the preview panel. To show this process, Iâ€™ll use the following free-to-download-and-use image from <a href="https://unsplash.com/" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*ywG-JtjKnXQY_g825Lv3aQ.jpeg" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ywG-JtjKnXQY_g825Lv3aQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ywG-JtjKnXQY_g825Lv3aQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ywG-JtjKnXQY_g825Lv3aQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ywG-JtjKnXQY_g825Lv3aQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ywG-JtjKnXQY_g825Lv3aQ.jpeg?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="5d0f">To do this, Iâ€™ll simply add this .jpg to my project Resources (bottom left panel), and then Iâ€™ll be able to select it as an <code>Image Texture</code>.</p><p id="65b9">Hereâ€™s a look at that process:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*ynSQO5RRgHbbi0aKbT-DZg.gif" width="600" height="338" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ynSQO5RRgHbbi0aKbT-DZg.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ynSQO5RRgHbbi0aKbT-DZg.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*ynSQO5RRgHbbi0aKbT-DZg.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*ynSQO5RRgHbbi0aKbT-DZg.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="45b1">As you can see, the background is now a style-altered version of the photo above.</p><p id="1cae">If I change that <code>Image Texture</code> back to <code>Device Camera Texture</code> and push to my device to test (iPhone SE), I end up with the results I showed at the outset. Hereâ€™s one more look at that, to compare:</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*LMZgA_NrQMO2hjIchfVAew.gif" width="200" height="400" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*LMZgA_NrQMO2hjIchfVAew.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="bd38">One last thing before we wrap upâ€¦I realize that the gifs included here are a bit difficult to make out at times. Apologies thereâ€”an unfortunate limitation of both Medium and screen recordings. In light of this, Iâ€™ve also uploaded the full process covered in this tutorial to YouTube (no sound on the video).</p></div></div><div><div><p id="163f">For meâ€”given my very limited experience/knowledge with ML, Lens Studio, and basic technical problemsâ€”this is a huge win.</p><p id="1f5e">But for Lens Creators who regularly work with 3D graphics and other immersive AR effects, this segmentation + style transfer Lens could serve as a starting point for some really unique and creative experiences.</p><p id="3c1e">If youâ€™d like to give this a shot with your own style transfer model, sign up for a free Fritz AI Sandbox account, which will give you access to our model building Studio (where I built the style transfer modelâ€”see part one of this tutorial series), as well as a growing collection range of ready-to-use ML-powered project templates.</p><p id="719b">Iâ€™d love to see what you come up withâ€”and maybe even feature youâ€™re work on Heartbeatâ€”so feel free to reach out with your creations.</p><blockquote><p id="e6ce">Weâ€™ve been covering SnapML in depth since itâ€™s release â€” <a href="https://fritz.ai/ebooks/snapml-guide?utm_campaign=snapml-ebook-integration&amp;utm_source=heartbeat" rel="noopener">explore what our team has learned about how to work with this mobile ML framework in our free-to-download ebook</a>.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]>

                    <p>Yesterday, my cofounder wrote a <a href="https://blog.nillium.com/its-time-to-remove-news-from-facebook-and-google/">controversial post on this blog</a>, presenting a case for news publishers to limit -- or remove -- their reporting from Facebook and Google. &nbsp;The responses were immediate and plentiful, but fascinatingly different depending on the audience.</p><p>On Hacker News, a tech- and startup-focused forum, the link rose to the top of the list before being “flagged” and removed from the front page. &nbsp;The<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249414"> comments there</a> took a more pragmatic, technical approach to the problem, from “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25249553">The technical capability already exists in the form of robots.txt and the referer header,</a>” to constant reminders that news organizations <em>need</em> this traffic.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/">r/journalism subreddit</a>, we were hit from the other side. &nbsp;Why not just “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge3zqq2/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">nationalize the press so we can quit with the hand-wringing</a>?” suggested one commenter, while another lamented that “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/k3kmg9/its_time_to_remove_news_from_facebook_and_google/ge51kko/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">this idea disenfranchises young journalists who don’t have any name credibility and recognition and need an established platforms [sic] gravitas to help establish them</a>.”</p><p>If ever there was a good illustration of the disconnect we face in trying to make journalism sustainable again, this is it. &nbsp;The tech side that constantly proclaims “information wants to be free,” and sees pay-for-journalism as a solved problem through Substack, and the jaded newsroom audience who sees another tech platform trying to come in and get them financially hooked.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that it is not a problem equally felt across these camps. &nbsp;The Hacker News crowd is absolutely correct when they say that news organizations need the traffic coming from social media and aggregators -- they do! -- but that is a sign of addiction, not a healthy ecosystem. &nbsp;And the journalist demographic has every reason to assume the worst, because they have been hurt before.</p><p>The economics of this are simple. &nbsp;</p><p>A few decades ago, people subscribed to newspapers, written on paper, that were delivered every morning. &nbsp;The subscription fee never fully covered the cost of running a newspaper; ads appeared between articles, and that subscription base guaranteed an audience for the sponsors. &nbsp;These publications naively started putting their articles online for free -- if advertising could buoy their business up until this point, why would the web be any different? &nbsp;As the ad market matured, CPMs increased, and slowly, internet advertising started to represent real money.</p><p>But then things went viral. &nbsp;Lots of things. &nbsp;People started sharing news articles they read (or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/16/six-in-10-of-you-will-share-this-link-without-reading-it-according-to-a-new-and-depressing-study/%20Show%20less">didn’t read</a>) on social media. &nbsp;Tech companies tweaked their sorting algorithms to get content to eyeballs -- and did so incredibly successfully. But, this created our first problem.</p><h3 id="problem-1-hard-news-doesn-t-trend">Problem 1: Hard news doesn't trend</h3><p>Admittedly, this is only a problem depending on what side of the fence you sit.</p><p>If your goal -- like that of any number of tech companies -- is to get content in front of your users that they will engage with -- then this has been an unmitigated success. &nbsp;However, if you are reporting out a story for a specific audience, not being able to reach them is problematic. &nbsp;</p><p>At this point, the tech side may wonder why if your articles are so great, the audience isn’t seeking it out. &nbsp;The answer, I suspect, is that the audience does not know it is there.</p><p>Virtually any digital editor will tell you that most traffic bypasses the homepage. &nbsp;Users rarely think &nbsp;“I wonder what is happening today?” and seek out the news site; rather, they are told what is happening by the sorting algorithms and walk away feeling like they are updated. &nbsp;That works to a degree, except that hard news -- especially local news -- does not trend.</p><p>No one shares the summary of last night’s city council meeting. &nbsp;Even the most damning investigative report will only get so far if it is focused on a small area; users outside the area just won’t amplify it.</p><h3 id="problem-2-fake-news">Problem 2: Fake News</h3><p>What <em>does</em> trend? &nbsp;The outrageous, crazy things that you want to share with the world. &nbsp;Of course, that’s not to say all viral headlines are fake, but at this point it seems pretty well accepted that many are.</p><p>Because anyone can write and post anything, these wholly fabricated, or hyper-partisan stories are usually placed in the same regard as those that are rigorously reported and fact-checked. They are then forced to compete against each other for attention.</p><p>Worse yet, these posts can be so malignant that it impugns the reputation of “the media” -- because now you cannot believe what you read.<br></p><h3 id="problem-3-clickbait">Problem 3: Clickbait</h3><p>How do you compete then? &nbsp;By stooping lower. &nbsp;It means publishers resort to writing clickbait headlines to grab a second or two of user attention, and then covering the article page in more clickbait links to keep them there. &nbsp;</p><p>It can even creep into the editorial decisions: Knowing what people are searching for or clicking on can shape what reporters are assigned. <br></p><h3 id="problem-4-all-the-ads">Problem 4: All the ads</h3><p>Why do drivers in your area need to know about that new law? &nbsp;What celebrity finally “broke [their] silence?” &nbsp;I <em>know</em> I won’t believe what happens next. &nbsp;</p><p>These ads are annoying. These ads are detrimental to the user experience that any publication wants. &nbsp;But these ads are needed -- they are a symptom of the addiction. &nbsp;When the flow of users becomes constricted, these organizations have no other choice but to exploit their traffic for as much as it is worth; it’s survival.</p><p>Those ads in between articles in the print newspaper? &nbsp;They still exist, but they are now sold by Facebook, Twitter, and Google. &nbsp;Money is still being made off of the reader, it just is not going to the people doing the reporting. &nbsp;And partnerships between newsrooms and tech giants are generally for big, national outlets, leaving the local newsroom to suffer.</p><h3 id="problem-5-brain-drain">Problem 5: Brain drain</h3><p>As awful as this all is for the casual news consumer, it is worse for the people working on it all day everyday. &nbsp;No one wants assignment-by-SEO. No one wants the ads all over the place. And most of all, no one wants the layoffs. &nbsp;So those that can are fleeing to Substack, or creating their own publications.</p><p>That is great for them, and I wish them all the best. &nbsp;But as that Reddit commenter pointed out, that only works for reporters who have made a name for themselves. &nbsp;It is much more common to follow someone because you like their ideas than someone who you think reports out a story well. &nbsp;</p><p>What about all of those wide eyed, young, idealistic reporters <em>looking </em>to make a name for themselves? &nbsp;What about all of the important stories <em>they</em> are covering? &nbsp;Will now fewer people go to the legacy publications once the big names jump ship?<br></p><h3 id="what-we-re-doing">What we're doing</h3><p>This is why Xana wrote what she did, and made the case firms should pay up. &nbsp;First, it got your attention enough to rise above the noise (a requirement, as discussed above). And it also presented this point: The traffic coming from big tech, while needed for local news’ survival, is also killing it. The answer cannot be found in robots.txt -- it comes from rethinking the model of how we find our users, and how we interact with them.</p><p>Forth is our answer. &nbsp; </p><p>We want to take what is appealing about discovering news on social, and replicate it, but with reporters we know and trust. &nbsp;We want to help them build personal brands because we know younger generations tend to trust real people over companies or institutions (think: influencers). &nbsp;We want to rev-share, not because we think it is a selling point, but to align our incentives with those of the newsrooms; we both succeed together.</p><p>We will be launching soon in markets where we feel we have enough reporters to make using our app worthwhile. &nbsp;If you are a reporter or represent a newsroom, we would love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:hello@nillium.com">hello@nillium.com</a>. &nbsp;If you want to read what our partners are writing, please sign up for the <a href="https://www.forthapp.com/list.html">waiting list</a> -- we will let you know as soon as we are live in your area.</p>

<p>The traditional CentOS Linux distribution as we know it is dead. Here is another drop in the ocean of opinion pieces that follow the news of its death. After cooling down from the initial rush of blood to my head, here is my take on this event.</p>

<h2>Why Did This Probably Happen</h2>
<p>With the advent of DevOps and SRE, businesses and startups are moving away from the old-school concept of traditional server clusters to running their applications on disposable containers. The trend is clear and true. Developers are increasingly less reliant on a tried-and-true Linux distribution that lasts for a decade. With containers, developers can develop, test, deploy, and rollback with blazing fast velocity.

</p><h2>How It Will Affect All of Us</h2>
<p>Without a doubt one of the most popular Linux distributions to ever exist, CentOS was prevalent among all kinds of computing systems ranging from simple database servers to billion-dollar computer clusters. There are countless organizations have made the business decision to keep using the traditional model, or organizations that do not require microservices at all. With CentOS drawn from below their feet, a lot of organizations will be forced to migrate to another option, or fork out a pretty penny for RHEL. Besides, on-prem deployment of any container orchestration tool still requires a stable Linux distribution.</p>

<p>The second ripple effect it will have is towards the skilled professionals who have spend decades on CentOS. Not every company is willing to pay up for RHEL or risk using CentOS Stream. For those who migrate to Debian or OpenSUSE, they will have to retrain and adapt with different tools.</p>

<h2>Questioning IBM/Red Hat Decisions</h2>
<p>The most obvious of them all was, was it necessary for CentOS to die? With CentOS Stream to track ahead of RHEL, it is still possible for CentOS to remain functional and serve its purpose. This is clearly a business decision to increase profits. It used to be that developers wanted to write for RHEL but did not want pay for it; CentOS filled that need. What also happened was that some companies decided that they wanted the free experience all the way. Red Hat now provides free use of the Red Hat Universal Base Image for developers. With this, companies no longer have an excuse.</p>

<p>Secondly, why the PR disaster? In hindsight, there is no way to deliver this news gently to the public. However, I felt that Red Hat gave the bird to the open source community, especially those who contributed to CentOS, by pulling the plug on Centos 8 towards the end of 2021. There wasn't even a courtesy to end it later then CentOS 7's EOL date, June 30th 2024. A raw-dogged "Pay up, now" to everyone. </p>

<p>Last of all, what is the next move from Red Hat/IBM? With CentOS gone, there is a huge vacuum for another to take its place. RHEL sources are still available and can still be repackaged. While Red Hat currently has massive influence over Linux in general, is this a arrogant statement proclaiming "Hey, you can't live without me"? Another ominuous take with conspiratorial undertones would be that Red Hat plans to eventually scrap the FOSS model, but I would have to wear my tin hat for this one.

</p><h2>So, What Happens Now?</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after the release, all the attention is now directed to towards filling the space that CentOS will leave behind. Undoubtedly, Ubuntu and SUSE would try to assert their presence with their open source alternatives. Debian, the largest behemoth of them all, hopefully will receive funding and participation like never before. A silver lining of this event would perhaps be the buzzing excitement of what will be and can be. It is time to be excited about Linux again. I, for one, have to begin migrating my CentOS containers and virtual machines to Debian.</p>

<p>CentOS's founder, Gregory Kurtzer, is working with the community to establish Rocky Linux. Join them at https://webchat.freenode.net/#rockylinux .</p>

                    <p>Let me start this article by saying - I love Elm!</p><p>I enjoy learning new programming languages, and Elm has been my favorite language for almost 2 years now. I like everything about it - compiler error messages, type system soundness, <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Elm Architecture</a>, pure functions, immutability, performance, etc. Around the time I discovered Elm, I got a job at <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamlit</a>, and I immediately saw the potential for how Elm and Streamlit could work together to supercharge apps. With the release of the Streamlit components architecture earlier this year, this was finally possible, and I'm excited to show you how! To get a taste, check out this awesome Elm <a href="https://terezka.github.io/line-charts/" rel="noopener noreferrer">line charts</a> library embedded into a Python <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-chart/app.py" rel="noopener noreferrer">data app</a>.</p><p>Before we start, if you're new to Streamlit and would like to learn more about it - check out these two articles "<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/coding-ml-tools-like-you-code-ml-models-ddba3357eace?sk=f7774c54571148b33cde3ba6c6310086">Intro to Streamlit</a>" and "<a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-streamlit-components/">Intro to Streamlit components</a>".</p><h2 id="ready-player-one">Ready Player One</h2><p>Here's the "<a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/">Hello World</a>" of Elm examples:</p><pre><code>
import Browser
import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)

main =
  Browser.sandbox { init = 0, update = update, view = view }

type Msg = Increment | Decrement

update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment -&gt;
      model + 1

    Decrement -&gt;
      model - 1

view model =
  div []
    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
    , div [] [ text (String.fromInt model) ]
    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
    ]

</code></pre><p>It is a simple counter app that demonstrates the simplicity, robustness, and beauty of The Elm Architecture. </p><p>We're going to build a Streamlit app that will use the above example as a Streamlit component. Streamlit components let you expand the functionality provided in the base Streamlit package. You can use Streamlit components to share any web-based UI, widget, or data visualization code with the broader Python data science community.</p><p>Creating a Streamlit component takes - literally - 2 lines of Python.</p><pre><code>
import streamlit as st
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

counter_component = components.declare_component(
    "counter",
    url="http://localhost:3000/",
)

count = counter_component(key="count", default=0)
st.markdown(f"The value of the counter is **{count}**.")

</code></pre><ul><li>We declare a new component by passing the name and the location of the component front-end files (or the URL of your development server).</li><li>We provide the default value for the counter.</li><li>We make sure that the component does not re-render unnecessarily by providing the <code>key</code>.</li></ul><h2 id="brave-new-world">Brave New World</h2><p>To establish a two-way connection between our app and the component, we are going to add <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/ports.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">ports</a> to our Elm app.</p><p>To send a message from Elm to Streamlit, let's define a port that receives a number and produces a command.</p><pre><code>
port fromElm : Int -&gt; Cmd msg

</code></pre><p>We will need to send the new value back to Streamlit on <code>Increment</code> and <code>Decrement</code> events. So let's modify our update function to reflect that.</p><pre><code>
Increment -&gt;
    ( { model | count = model.count + 1 }
    , fromElm (model.count + 1)
    )

Decrement -&gt;
    ( { model | count = model.count - 1 }
    , fromElm (model.count - 1)
    )

</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="thereandbackagain">There and Back Again</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To send a message from Streamlit to Elm, let's define a port that receives a number and produces a subscription.</p><pre><code>
port fromJS : (Int -&gt; msg) -&gt; Sub msg

</code></pre><p>Firstly, we will define a new message type.</p><pre><code>
type Msg
    = Default Int
    | Increment
    | Decrement

</code></pre><p>Secondly, we will add a handler for that message type to update.</p><pre><code>
Default value -&gt;
    ( { model | count = value }
    , Cmd.none
    )

</code></pre><p>And finally, we will subscribe to the messages on that port.</p><pre><code>
subscriptions : Model -&gt; Sub Msg
subscriptions _ =
    fromJS Default

</code></pre><p>When a message from JavaScript is sent to that port, the <code>Default</code> event will get a number and set the counter value to that number.</p><p>And that's <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-counter/app.py">it</a>!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Recording-2020-12-08-at-03.30.25-PM.gif" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I hope this tutorial will help you build dazzling components in Elm. I believe there are a lot of incredible Elm packages that would boost the look and feel of Python data apps. To give you an idea, <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gampleman/elm-visualization/latest/">elm-visualization</a> would make a fantastic Streamlit Component - and there are many, many more. I'm excited to see more people discover the awesomeness of Elm, and I look forward to seeing what you create!</p><p>P.S. <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-chart/app.py">Both</a> <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kantuni/streamlit-elm-counter/app.py">apps</a> are available on GitHub and have been deployed using <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/sharing-sign-up">Streamlit sharing</a>.</p>

December 9, 2020 | https://serokell.io/blog/daml-interview | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serokell.io/blog/daml-interview">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digital Asset is a fintech company that helps companies design and run the next generation of business applications. One of their products is <a href="https://daml.com/">DAML</a>, a functional smart contract language.</p><p>While we have already covered Digital Asset in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/functional-programming-in-fintech">functional programming in fintech overview</a>, I recently got a chance to talk with Anthony Lusardi, a developer advocate at DAML, and delve deeper into the product. In the interview, we talk about DAML, the benefits and downsides of functional programming languages, and their practical experience while building DAML.</p><p><strong>Hi! Could you shortly explain what DAML is?</strong></p><p>Sure! DAML is an open-source smart contract language with roots firmly planted in Haskell. It’s designed so multiple parties/business entities can perform workflows with high assurances and consistency between parties. So you have this transactional language that is atomic with every update, high level, portable across data persistence backends, and with strongly enforced permissions over who can update data when.</p><p>In more practical terms, imagine you’re managing an operationally complex workflow where multiple different stakeholders (ie. parties) need to see and interact with different parts of the workflow, definitely should not see other parts, and have a complex tree of dependencies. Today implementing such a thing is truly hard to manage with complex access control schemes implemented at a level outside of your program, and substantial difficulties maintaining data privacy. DAML treats these concerns as first-class elements of every class (what DAML calls templates) and thus makes it much easier to implement and manage these types of workflows.</p><p><strong>Why should customers choose DAML over building their project on Ethereum, Tezos, or other public blockchains?</strong></p><p>This really boils down to their needs. If you’re building something that truly needs permissionless, censorship-resistant, and entirely public transactions, then a public blockchain might be a good fit despite what would be substantial tradeoffs for most real-world applications in terms of low data storage, poor privacy, and high cost. DAML, on the other hand, won’t give you a permissionless architecture but will allow you to have high data storage, strong privacy, and significantly lower costs.</p><p>In practice, very few use cases actually need the properties of a permissionless public blockchain. The one that comes to mind for me where a public blockchain is a better fit would be Bitcoin for permissionless value storage/transfer.</p><p>While I think there are some interesting projects on Ethereum, I’m not personally convinced most use cases need Ethereum’s architecture as, with a few exceptions, most have components that in practice are replaceable and centrally administered by their development team. In such cases, these teams are trading off ease of operation for decentralized architectures and really getting neither. That is, of course, open for extensive theoretical debate that is well beyond the scope of this interview :)</p><p><strong>What’s the main thing that separates DAML from other enterprise blockchain platforms like Corda and Hyperledger Fabric?</strong></p><p>DAML applications can be written once and deployed on any supported platform without changing a single line of code. In this way, your code written in DAML is decoupled from the underlying backend allowing for much greater architectural flexibility.</p><p>In fact, DAML actually runs on these platforms (and many others) with a runtime that runs alongside them and uses them for data persistence and consensus. It’ll even run on PostgreSQL. It’s truly platform-agnostic.</p><p><strong>What’s the benefit of basing DAML on functional programming languages like Haskell and Scala?</strong></p><p>Simple. Functional programmers are the best programmers.</p><p>More seriously, though, the language is based on Haskell but has conventions and differences that make it uniquely its own language. The general benefits are a high degree of composability, as anyone who writes in functional languages knows, when your types match your functions and components can easily work together and extend each other. Functional languages are also beneficial for the more distributed applications that DAML is designed for because they reduce bugs and allow for better ensuring that operations will or won’t complete; both of which are big concerns whenever you’re writing a distributed application.</p><p><strong>Are there any features of the language that really help smart contract language development?</strong></p><p>Most definitely. DAML has two features that really help. The first is that all data concerns are laid out in templates and strongly typed. In a lot of ways, these templates are much like classes in imperative languages <strong><em>but</em></strong> they will always do what you expect them to.</p><p>The other feature (and this is really smart-contract specific) is that DAML treats permissions as first-class citizens, so we have observers, signatories, and choices which you can consider respectively akin to UNIX’s <code>rwx </code>permissions. Every template specifies ahead of time who has the authority to read, write, and execute functions on a given instance of that template (what we call a contract in DAML).</p><p><strong>Have you seen any non-technical benefits? ( e.g. is it easier to hire good developers, etc.)</strong></p><p>Reductions in codebase size and operational complexity are definitely benefits. It’s really designed from the ground up to allow developers to focus solely on business logic without having to worry about the backend. These factors, in turn, make DAML applications cheaper to maintain and easier to extend. Basically, all the benefits functional programmers have been touting for a long time.</p><p>One other great benefit is readability. While it takes a programmer to write DAML, many non-programmers can comprehend much of a DAML contract with just a little bit of familiarization. This really comes as a direct consequence of how explicit DAML is about data concerns and permissions. You can check out an example of this readability at <a href="https://beer.woah.xyz/">https://beer.woah.xyz</a>.</p><p><strong>What about downsides? Are there any downsides to choosing a programming language for your project that is not that popular?</strong></p><p>There certainly are, but if you’re reading this blog post, then you probably already use non-mainstream programming languages that are still wonderful and let you get your work done in effective ways that mainstream languages don’t support. Innovation happens at the edges so I think DAML’s benefits in the smart contract space and its enthusiastic and supportive engineers on our forum more than outweigh the tradeoffs.</p><p>Really the biggest concern people have is essentially “if I choose to invest time in learning this language, will it still be there next year?” and for that, the answer is yes. DAML is an open-source language maintained by Digital Asset, which is a company of 140+ people currently and growing. DAML will be here for years to come.</p><p><strong>Do you feel happy about your choice to create an FP language for your project?</strong></p><p>I don’t think you could build a non-functional language that accomplished what DAML does. It’s really a prerequisite for the rest of the stack. So in that sense, yes, and also the decision was made well before I joined Digital Asset.</p><p><strong>If you had to give one tip to customers looking to come into the blockchain/DLT space, what would it be?</strong></p><p>If the app needs you to first buy a token to use it, then run away.</p><hr><p>I would like to thank Anthony for the interview and wish DAML the best of luck in conquering the private blockchain market!</p><p>If you wish to get more details on DAML, go straight to their <a href="https://daml.com/">homepage</a>.

<p><span>F</span>eel-good moments are difficult to come by on Twitter in Pakistan. In between the political infighting and trolls, though, there was a brief moment where the ugliness the platform often brings out in people gave way to the app’s potential for humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, a Karachi school teacher, Aimun Faisal, tweeted questions from her students about space and space travel. “Do you get scared that your space shuttle might get lost?” one 10-year-old asked. Ms. Faisal tagged NASA and other space agencies in the post, encouraging readers to retweet it and bring it to their attention. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/nasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">It worked</a>.</p>



<p>A Canadian astronaut who has flown in a space shuttle twice replied that he wasn’t scared because Earth was nearby, and he could use the stars to find his way. “I felt especially comforted when I flew over home,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/1316390465277767682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1316390465277767682%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgulfnews.com%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fpakistan%2Fnasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">he tweeted</a>. “Here’s a photo I took of Karachi — can you find your school?”</p>



<p>It’s the kind of interaction that leads one to believe that perhaps all you need in life is a Twitter account and a heart that still beats. The media ate it up too: Ms. Faisal and her tweet were in all the major newspapers and even on TV. We were gushy over Ms. Faisal; we wished there were more teachers like her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few weeks later, people were suggesting that Ms. Faisal should go jump into a river or move to another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It all turned after — what else? — a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One evening this past September, a woman set out in her car on a motorway outside Lahore, her two children in tow. Motorways in Pakistan are safer than most roads there; they have their own police, who have a reputation, unlike other police units, for being well-dressed and resistant to corruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That evening, the woman’s car ran out of fuel. She locked her car doors and made some phone calls, but the rescue service didn’t answer, and she couldn’t get through to her family. By now, it was past midnight. She made more calls and waited for a friend to come pick her up. While she waited, two men emerged from the darkness, broke her car window, and when she fought back, took her children into some nearby bushes. She scrambled to save them, and while she fought, she was gang-raped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the pre–social media age, if a rape story ever got more than a couple of column inches on the inside pages of a newspaper, the victim not only had asked for it but, by reporting it and making it public, was asking for something more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with the <em>Washington Post</em>, Pakistan’s former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf (now absconded from the country) once said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/09/19/musharraf-denies-rape-comments/5f2e0d4c-5ff2-4273-81e5-878cd59a1744/">Pakistani women get themselves raped so they can get a Canadian visa</a>. He probably thought he was being funny or insightful. When his office denied his having said it, the <em>Post</em> made the audio public. You can hear one of his aides laughing in the background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attitudes toward rape haven’t changed much since the Musharraf days, but there was something about the awfulness of a woman trapped with her children on a motorway at night that struck a chord with the Pakistani public. As the news rippled through Twitter, #LahoreMotorwayIncident became a trending hashtag. The details of the crime were so grotesque that, for a few days, it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54186609">seemed the nation actually believed that rape was a crime</a> and that the woman hadn’t asked for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pakistan’s traditional and social media go into this kind of outrage cycle when children get raped, or get raped and then killed, which happens more often than one can stomach. There was genuine fury across the country when a 7-year-old girl was raped, strangled, and left in a rubbish heap two years ago. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1439587">Her name was Zainab</a>. On Twitter and Facebook, users argued over whether her rapist and killer should be hanged in public, quartered, doused in acid, or just locked up for life.</p>



<p>After the motorway incident, the usual bloodlust was on display. There were calls for public hangings and for chopping up the culprits. Prime Minister Imran Khan even appeared on a TV interview saying <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/asia/imran-khan-chemical-castration-rapists-intl/index.html">he has been contemplating chemical castration as a punishment for such crimes</a>.</p>

<p>And while the Lahore rapists were still on the loose, the newly appointed Lahore police chief appeared on one of the nightly news shows during the wall-to-wall media coverage. In effect, he said he was surprised that a mother of two had decided to take the motorway when another road would have sufficed for her journey. And if she had to take the motorway, he went on to ask, couldn’t she at least have checked her gas tank?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, the teacher we had fawned over just weeks prior for her tweets about space travel, was outraged. On Twitter, she was one of many to demand the police chief’s resignation, tweeting in disgust at the craven responses to the news she and others were seeing, rhetorical questions as to why the woman had failed to prevent her own assault.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In return, our beloved Ms. Faisal was met with a flood of insults; trolls suggested she leave Pakistan if she had a problem with it. Being stuck on the motorway without gas became an internet meme that small-time politicians and social media trolls lobbed at one another. Somewhere along the way, “Why didn’t she check her petrol tank before leaving her home?” replaced the original question: “What kind of beasts would rape a woman in front of her children?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did this horror morph into a meme? Does every one of us carry inside us a bit of General Musharraf, smirking while his aides giggle?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long before we had social media, Pakistan swam through its sea of miseries on the backs of jokes. The mausoleum of Pakistan’s longest-serving dictator, General Zia’ul Haq, is jokingly referred to as Jaws Square. Guess why? Because, after ruling over us for 11 years, he died in a plane crash, and only his teeth survived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jokes back then went viral before we ever began to call them “viral.” You would hear one about the dictator in Urdu in Karachi one day, and the next day in Peshawar, someone would tell you it in Pashto. Jokes eased us out of our terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now the jokes themselves have become the terror. You can make a joke about a dead dictator, or Osama bin Laden becoming fish food, but how do you laugh at a joke about a woman raped in front of her children on the side of the motorway in the dead of night? Jokes were meant to subvert the powerful, not kick the poor to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a brief moment, social media in Pakistan made it easy to laugh at despots and oppressors. They answered with troll farms, indoctrinating the youth to be subservient to power. Even in the midst of incidents so nauseating that they capture the attention of our fractured social media, the horrors of which seem undeniable, the trolls find ways to mock and belittle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November, another shocking piece of news roiled Pakistan’s social media: A 4-year-old rape survivor told her gut-wrenching story in a video that went viral. It was so harrowing, I couldn’t bring myself to watch it, even for reporting purposes. In another video, also shared widely online, the doctor who treated her after the assault broke down crying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Twitter, it’s easy to find redemption in the narrative too. In the middle of the outrage cycle, social media made a hero of the policeman <a href="https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2020/11/14/pakistani-policeman-uses-own-daughter-as-bait-to-nab-rapists">who had found the girl’s rapist by enlisting his own daughter to lure him</a>. The rapist was killed in a police encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The policeman and his underage daughter were forced to take this extreme step because there were no women officers in his district. The prime minister called to congratulate the man, and his daughter was awarded a million rupees as a prize along with a guaranteed college scholarship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, who by now has endured a litany of abuses online, questioned the collective satisfaction on social media. As proud as we are of the police officer, she tweeted, the story said more about the country’s broken system than it did about heroism. “No police officer should be forced to risk his family to perform his duty,”<a href="https://twitter.com/bluemagicboxes/status/1327209635594588165"> she wrote</a>.</p>



<p>“Tum kabhi khush na hona,” someone tweeted back. “You’ll never be happy.”</p>

        <div><p>Over the past weeks and months, we’ve seen people coming to YouTube to learn more about where and how to vote or learning more about a candidate or an issue. We’ve seen news organizations grow their audience. And we’ve seen people turn to YouTube for the latest election results or simply to follow an historic event with the highest voting turnout in over a century in the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our main goal going into the election season was to make sure we’re connecting people with authoritative information, while also limiting the reach of misinformation and removing harmful content.

        <div><h2>Removing content that violates our policies</h2><p>Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a> prohibit spam, scams, or other manipulated media, coordinated influence operations, and any content that seeks to incite violence. Since September, we've terminated over 8000 channels and thousands of harmful and misleading elections-related videos for violating our existing policies. Over 77% of those removed videos were taken down before they had 100 views.&nbsp;</p><p>We also work to make sure that the line between what is removed and what is allowed is drawn in the right place. Our policies prohibit misleading viewers about where and how to vote. We also disallow content alleging widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of a historical U.S. Presidential election. However in some cases, that has meant allowing controversial views on the outcome or process of counting votes of a current election as election officials have worked to finalize counts.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential elections. For example, we will remove videos claiming that a Presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors. We will begin enforcing this policy today, and will ramp up in the weeks to come. As always, news coverage and commentary on these issues can remain on our site if there’s sufficient <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/look-how-we-treat-educational-documentary-scientific-and-artistic-content-youtube/">education, documentary, scientific or artistic</a> context.</p></div>

Over 70% of recommendations on election-related topics came from authoritative news sources and the top recommended videos and channels for election-related content were primarily authoritative news. In fact, the top 10 authoritative news channels were recommended over 14X more than the top 10 non-authoritative channels on election-related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these encouraging results, we recognize there's always more to do. For example, while problematic misinformation represents a fraction of 1% of what's watched on YouTube in the U.S., we know we can bring that number down even more. And some videos, while not recommended prominently on YouTube, continue to get high views, sometimes coming from other sites. We're continuing to consider this and other new challenges as we make ongoing improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>We understand the need for intense scrutiny on our elections-related work. Our teams work hard to ensure we are striking a balance between allowing for a broad range of political speech and making sure our platform isn't abused to incite real-world harm or broadly spread harmful misinformation. We welcome ongoing debate and discussion and will keep engaging with experts, researchers and organizations to ensure that our policies and products are meeting that goal. And as always, we'll apply learnings from this election to our ongoing efforts to protect the integrity of elections around the world.<br></p></div>

                                                    <p>ABU DHABI, 9th December, 2020 (WAM) -- The UAE’s Ministry of Health and Prevention, MOHAP, has announced the official registration of Beijing Institute of Biological Product’s inactivated COVID-19 vaccine in a major step towards combating the global pandemic. The registration of this vaccine is a decision in response to the application from Sinopharm CNBG. The announcement is a significant vote of confidence by the UAE’s health authorities in the safety and efficacy of this vaccine.</p>

<p>MOHAP, in collaboration with Department of Health Abu Dhabi, DOH, has&nbsp;reviewed Sinopharm CNBG’s interim analysis of the phase III trials, which shows Beijing Institute of Biological Product’s inactivated vaccine to have 86 percent&nbsp;efficacy against COVID-19 infection. The analysis also shows the vaccine to have 99 percent&nbsp;seroconversion rate of neutralising antibody and 100 percent&nbsp;effectiveness in preventing moderate and severe cases of the disease. Furthermore, the analysis shows no serious safety concerns.</p>

<p>This vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorisation, EUA,&nbsp;since September by MOHAP to protect frontline workers most at risk of COVID-19. The UAE is conducting Post Authorisation Safety Study, PASS,&nbsp;and Post Authorisation Efficacy Study, PAES,&nbsp;of its EUA programme. These ongoing studies show similar safety and efficacy profiles as the interim analysis.</p>

<p>The #4Humanity phase III trials have included 31,000 volunteers across 125 nationalities in the UAE alone. The EUA vaccination programme has effectively safeguarded the UAE frontline workers. MOHAP's official registration of Beijing Institute of Biological Product’s inactivated COVID-19 vaccine leads the way to comprehensively protecting the population and responsibly opening the economy.</p>

Why? As you will see below, when we use the right data structures it becomes much easier to write functions that operate on them, which in turn leads to fun and profit!</p><p>The goal of this article is to show you an example of how to approach coming up with good data structures. We'll do this by comparing three different data structures for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic Tac Toe</a> board.</p><p>Here's a sneak peek at them. Which one would you bet your lunch money on?</p><figure><img src="https://monicao.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/2020-11-25/tic_tac_toe_boards_elixir.png" alt="boards"></figure><h2 id="a-quick-real-world-example">A quick real-world example</h2><p>But first, let me describe a problem I ran into in the past. I was building an Elixir/Phoenix application that served as a backend to a React client. One of the API endpoints was designed to serve up a large chunk of the current user's state, because &nbsp; &nbsp;we wanted the React application to be very fast after the initial page load. The initial JSON payload looked something like this:</p><pre><code>{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "full_name": "Bob Dobolina",
    "email": "bob@dobo.inc",
    "projects": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Project 1",
        "proofs": [
          {
            "id": 1, 
            "title": "A design proof",
            "comments": [...]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre><p>On the user's dashboard we show a list of projects, and that's fairly easy to do with this structure. Where things get hairy, is when we render the page that displays a proof along with the comments for that proof. With this deeply nested data structure it would have been a real pain for the React client to traverse the tree and pull the data for a specific proof. The solution was to flatten this data structure and make look-up by id easier. The data structure had to make sense for the main operation we were performing on it, which was data lookup by id.</p><h2 id="the-three-steps">The three steps</h2><p>The examples below are in Elixir, but the general approach applies to any programming language. Here is the general approach:</p><ol><li>Make a list of the operations you will need to perform on the data structure</li><li>Brainstorm some data structures</li><li>Evaluate each data structure by going over the operations you need to perform on them</li></ol><p>At this stage you want to get a sense of whether or not the code will be easy to write and the performance is OK in terms of CPU and memory usage.</p><p>If you are thinking: "I work on web applications for businesses. What could I possibly learn from a Tic Tac Toe game?", I ask for your patience. The takeaways from this article are very relevant to the algorithmic problems we have to solve in our day-to-day work.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-operations-that-will-be-performed-on-the-board">What are the operations that will be performed on the board?</h2><p>First, let's put together a list of the operations that we will perform on the data structure, because without knowing this, we cannot evaluate if the data structures we're coming up with are any good. There are many ways we could represent a 3x3 board, but which one is a good fit for a Tic Tac Toe board? Well, what are some things we need to do with a Tic Tac Toe board?</p><ul><li>Read and write the value at a given coordinate</li><li>Display the board as a 3 x 3 grid in the terminal</li><li>Check the 8 different positions that indicate a win</li><li>Know if the board is full, so we can see if the game is over</li></ul><h2 id="brainstorm-data-structures-and-evaluate-them">Brainstorm data structures and evaluate them</h2><p>For the rest of the article we will be starting off with this board:</p><pre><code>X _ _
_ O _
_ X _
</code></pre><p>Let's try out some data structures and evaluate the pros and cons.</p><h3 id="first-attempt-nested-tuples-of-rows-and-columns">First attempt: Nested tuples of rows and columns</h3><p>Intuitively, when you think of a 3x3 grid you might think of a matrix or two-dimensional array. One way to implement that in Elixir is by using nested <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Tuple.html#content">Tuples</a>.</p><p>Side note: Why not use nested Lists here? For functional data structures, it's recommended to use tuples in situations where the position of a value means something. In this case, the position of the outer tuples represents rows, and the inner tuples represent columns.</p><pre><code>{
  {"X", nil, nil},
  {nil, "O", nil},
  {nil, "X", nil}
}
</code></pre><p>Seems like a good start.</p><p>Let's look at our list of operations and get a sense of how easy it will be to write these as functions.</p><p><strong>Reading and writing the value at a given coordinate.</strong></p><p>It's the second player's turn and they want to write an O in the top corner of the board at row 1, col 3.</p><p>To do this we might write a function like <code>write(board, row: 1, col: 3, move: "O")</code>.</p><p>How would you implement this function?</p><p>Since data structures in Elixir are immutable, it means we have to re-create the tuple for row 1 and re-create the board tuple to return an updated board. This is not hard to do, but it's clunky and the code is not very readable.</p><p>We don't have to write out the function to know that this would be unwieldy to implement.</p><p><strong>Displaying the board as a 3x3 grid</strong></p><p>This seems like it will be pretty straightforward if we flatten the nested tuples into a list and iterate over each element.</p><p><strong>Checking the 8 different positions that indicate a win</strong></p><p>Thanks to Elixir's pattern matching, checking if a board has a winning line is fairly easy to read and implement. For example, if you wanted to check if the middle row has a winning line you could write.</p><pre><code>def find_winner(
  {
    {_, _, _},
    {a, b, c},
    {_, _, _},
  }
) when a == b and b == c and !is_nil?(a), do: a</code></pre><p><strong>Knowing if the board is full</strong></p><p>To check if the board is full we can count up all the free tiles, which are represented as <code>nil</code>:</p><pre><code>def board_full?(board)
  num_free_tiles = board
    |&gt; Tuple.to_list
    |&gt; Enum.reduce(0, fn(row, free_spots) -&gt;
      free_in_row = row |&gt; Tuple.to_list |&gt; Enum.count(&amp;is_nil/1)
      free_in_row + free_spots
    end)
  num_free_tiles == 0
end</code></pre><p>Maybe there's a better implementation here, but so far, the code above is not looking very easy to read and maintain.</p><p>Overall, one of the weaknesses of this data structure seems to be that it is nested and accessing a value requires reading two tuples. Also tuples are not that easy to iterate over as we have to convert them to lists, if we want to use those juicy <code>Enum</code> functions.</p><h3 id="second-attempt-map-with-coordinates-as-keys">Second attempt: Map with coordinates as keys</h3><p>In the tuple data structure our biggest issue seemed to be making it easy to access values at a given row and column. Let's try making that easier by creating a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Map.html#content">Map</a> where the keys are the <code>{row, col}</code> coordinate.</p><pre><code>{
  {1, 1} =&gt; "X",
  {1, 2} =&gt; nil,
  {1, 3} =&gt; nil,
  {2, 1} =&gt; nil,
  {2, 2} =&gt; "O",
  {2, 3} =&gt; nil,
  {3, 1} =&gt; nil,
  {3, 2} =&gt; "X",
  {3, 3} =&gt; nil
}
</code></pre><p><strong>Reading and writing to a position</strong></p><p>This becomes easier with this data structure.</p><p>For reading the item at row 1, column 1 we can simply do a lookup by key:</p><pre><code>%{{1, 1} =&gt; val} = board
</code></pre><p>To update the value at row 1, column 3 we can use <code>Map.put</code>:</p><pre><code>Map.put(board, {1, 3}, "O")
</code></pre><p><strong>Checking the 8 different positions to win</strong></p><p>We can apply the same strategy for reading a single value to reading a group of values. For example, here's what it would look like if we used pattern matching to check if the first row had equal values.</p><pre><code>@doc ~S"""
  Takes in a board and returns either "X" or "O" if there is a winner or nil.
  
  Example
  
  iex&gt; TicTacToe.find_winner(
      {
        {1, 1} =&gt; "X", {1, 2} =&gt; "O", {1, 3} =&gt; nil,
        {2, 1} =&gt; nil, {2, 2} =&gt; "X", {2, 3} =&gt; nil,
        {3, 1} =&gt; nil, {3, 2} =&gt; "O", {3, 3} =&gt; "X"
      }
    )
  "X"

"""
# checks if the first row has the same tile 
def find_winner(%{{1, 1} =&gt; a, {1, 2} =&gt; b, {1, 3} =&gt; c})
  when a == b and b == c and !is_nil(a), do: a # check first row
def find_winner(%{{1, 1} =&gt; a, {2, 2} =&gt; b, {3, 3} =&gt; c})
  when a == b and b == c and !is_nil(a), do: a # check \ diagonal
def find_winner(%{{1, 3} =&gt; a, {2, 2} =&gt; b, {3, 1} =&gt; c})
  when a == b and b == c and !is_nil(a), do: a # check / diagonal
# ... and so on for the remaining 5 cases
def find_winner(_board), do: nil
</code></pre><p>This is easy enough to implement, but the code itself is not all that easy to read, in my opinion. From reading the first clause, it's not that easy to see that it deals with checking if the first row has the same tiles. It's always a bit of &nbsp;a code smell to me when I have to add a comment to explain what a line does. Also, the board itself is not very readable in the doctest, not to mention that when you <code>IO.inspect</code> it in IEx it will be even less readable, because each key will be printed on a new line.</p><p><strong>Displaying the board as a 3x3 grid</strong></p><p>Maps in Elixir are not ordered, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40392012/is-ordering-of-keys-and-values-preserved-in-elixir-when-you-operate-on-a-map">even though it seems like they are because IEx displays them in order</a>. This means we can't just iterate over the keys and print out the values.</p><p>To display the board we can use a nested loop of row and column ids and look up the values that way.</p><p>This is not ideal. Let's see if we can come up with something better.</p><h4 id="third-attempt-list-of-positions">Third attempt: List of positions</h4><p>Instead of thinking of the board in terms of rows and columns, what if we think of the board with positions from 0 to 8?</p><pre><code>0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
</code></pre><p>In Elixir, we could use a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/List.html#content">List</a> to represent this.</p><pre><code>[
  "X", nil, nil,
  nil, "O", nil,
  nil, "X", nil
]
</code></pre><p>This feels like a better fit than the other two! Are your intuition butterflies fluttering yet? Let's double check this intuition by reviewing the operations.</p><p><strong>Reading and writing to a position</strong></p><p>Instead of saying <em>"Player 1 marked X at row 1 column 3"</em>, we would think of it as <em>"Player 2 marked O at position 2"</em>, which is as simple as <code>List.update_at(board, 2, "X")</code>.</p><p>To check if position 2 has already been taken, it's as easy as <code>Enum.at(board, 2)</code>, which is an O(n) operation, but we don't need to worry about the time complexity for this problem at all, because we are dealing with such a small data set.</p><p><strong>Checking the 8 different positions to win</strong></p><p>Just as with the nested tuple example, checking if there is a winning line on the board we can use pattern matching. Let's say you wanted to check if the second row has all the same numbers:</p><pre><code>[
  _, _, _,
  a, b, c,
  _, _, _
] = board
</code></pre><p>How about a diagonal?</p><pre><code>[
  a, _, _,
  _, b, _,
  _, _, c
] = board
</code></pre><p><strong>Knowing if the board is full &amp; Displaying …</strong></p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>‍<em>Lots of interesting Deep learning applications rely on the use of complex architectures fueled by large datasets. With the growing storage capacities and ease of data collection [1], it is very easy to build a large dataset. However, when doing so, one ends up with lots of redundancies within the dataset. Many of these redundancies are systematically introduced by the data collection process: consecutive frames extracted from a video, very similar images collected from the web.</em></p><p>‍</p><p><em>In this blog post, we present the results of a benchmark study showing the benefits of filtering redundant data.</em></p><p>‍</p><p>Redundancies can take multiple forms, the simplest one is having exact image duplicates. Another form is near-duplicates, i.e images shifted with few pixels across some direction or images having slight light changes. These redundancies not only lead to biased results of the model’s performance, be it accuracy or mean average precision mAP score, but also lead to high annotation costs. In addition, redundancies have also been observed in very known academic datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet [2,3].</p><p><em>This benchmark study investigates the effect of redundancies in the image-based datasets collected by AI Retailer Systems (AIRS), an innovative start-up developing a checkout-free solution for retailers, which concentrates to answer “who picks up what?”. In this study, we consider an object detection task. An intelligent vision system recognizes products on a shelf or on a customer’s hand. This study was done as part of my role as a machine learning engineer at Lightly, a tech-based start-up that provides a solution to improve the Machine Learning workflow by finding and removing redundancies in unlabeled data.</em></p><p>This blog post will be structured as follow, we start by describing the dataset, we list the methods used in this study. We present the results obtained and finally, we discuss the importance of filtering redundant data.</p><p>‍</p><h3>AI Retailer System dataset</h3><figure id="w-node-fb91938a7325-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc116f1e87ac1_1*d-3gi2AuKFbrOm7UnfCIQg.gif"></p><figcaption>Short video sample extracted from AIRS video.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The dataset used consists of images extracted from short videos capturing a customer grabbing different products. There are two different cameras recording videos of the shelf, each camera has a different angle of view. There are 12 different kinds of products -12 classes.</p><p>The dataset has been manually annotated using the open-source annotation tool Vatic, we measured the annotation rate: number of frames per time unit. In our case this was 2.3 ± 0.8 frames per minute, given that there are 51 objects on average in each image, this is equivalent to 0.51 seconds for each bounding box.</p><figure id="w-node-16a5839147a8-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc10ddee87ac3_1*Yzs8PZV1FB_MJ5b38ngf-A.png"></p><figcaption>Sample image from Camera 1 with annotations: the box color does not represent the article class.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-ff8edff111f8-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1e0c0e87ac4_1*_dvPbzOu1xxvWH3otGcalA.png"></p><figcaption>Sample image from Camera 2 with annotations: the box color does not represent the article class.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>The annotated dataset has 7909 images. The training dataset has 2899 images, 80% of these images are from camera 2 and 20% from camera 1. For the test dataset, it has 5010 images and all of them from camera 1.</p><figure id="w-node-da318627f465-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1f6afe87ad4_1*bI7L8tkO5M0ohX70o-MqYg.png"></p><figcaption>Visualization of the train-test setting for AIRS dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>This specific design of the train and test datasets was motivated by the following points: First, we build an imbalanced dataset with a high fraction of images coming from one camera. Second, we make the object detection task hard for the model. With this train-test setting, we can calculate the fraction of images from Camera 1 in the filtered data. Therefore, we can see if there is any re-balancing that is introduced by the different filtering methods used.</p><p>Next, we present the methods used in this case study.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Active learning and Sampling methods</h3><p>To probe the effects of filtering the dataset, we borrowed ideas from the field of <strong>Active learning</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-04f7b8ea6774-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1a186e87ae5_1*OQsiXePTV5fesdkxPB-sIw.png"></p><figcaption>Active learning loop used in this case study.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Active learning aims at finding a subset of the training data achieving the highest possible performance. In this study, we used the pool-based active learning loop that works as follows: Start with a small fraction of the training dataset called the labeled pool. Train a model on this labeled pool. Then, use the model along with a filtering method to select new data points that should be labeled. Add the newly selected samples to the labeled pool and finally train the model from scratch on the updated labeled pool. After each cycle, we report the model’s performance on the test dataset for each filtering method used. In our case, we used 5% of the training data as the initial labeled pool, we trained the model for 50 epochs, and we added 20% of the training data in each active learning loop.</p><p>The object detection model used in this benchmark study is YOLO V3 (You Only Look Once) [4]. We used the implementation provided by the Ultralytics Github repository. The code was slightly modified in order to introduce the active learning loop.</p><p>As for the filtering methods, we used four different filtering methods provided by Lightly:</p><ul role="list"><li>“<strong>RSS</strong>”: Refers to random sub-sampling which will be used as a baseline.</li><li>“<strong>WTL_unc</strong>”: This method refers to Lightly uncertainty based sub-sampling, it selects difficult images that the model is highly uncertain about. The uncertainty is assessed using the model’s predictions.</li><li>“<strong>WTL_CS</strong>”: This method uses image representations to select images that are both diverse and difficult. It combines uncertainty-based sub-sampling with diversity selection. The image representations are obtained using state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods using the PIP package Boris-ml. The advantage of self-supervised learning methods is that they don’t require annotations to generate image representations.</li><li>“<strong>WTL_pt</strong>”: Relies on pre-trained models to learn image representations, the filtering is performed by removing the most similar images. Similarity in this case is given by the L2 distance between image representations.</li></ul><p>Both methods “<strong>WTL_unc</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” use active learning since they use the deep learning model to decide which data points to filter. Whereas the “<strong>WTL_pt</strong>” method does require neither labels nor a deep learning model to filter the dataset. For curious readers, this article presents a comprehensive overview of different sampling strategies used in active learning.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Benchmark study results</h3><p>We present the results of these experiments below.</p><figure id="w-node-08c3a0c158ed-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc18dece87ae7_1*e7rBEziO4Nc3Ci_SqTlAjQ.png"></p><figcaption>Averaged mAP score for different fractions of the training dataset using 4 seeds.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We see that the mAP score is low at small fractions of the training dataset. We observe that mAP score saturates when using only 25% of the training data and reaches a value of 0.8. Above the saturation point, the mAP score increases very slowly until it reaches its highest value of 0.84. The saturation at low fractions of the training dataset indicates that there are lots of redundancies in the dataset.</p><p>We notice that for small fractions, i.e 5%, the “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” filtering method is significantly better than the random baseline. As for high fractions, i.e 85%, the “WTL_pt” is able to <strong>achieve the same performance achieved when using the full training dataset</strong>. The “<strong>WTL_unc</strong>” method is on par or worse with the random sub-sampling method “<strong>RSS</strong>”.</p><p>Given that the saturation is reached within a small fraction of the training dataset, we perform a “Zoom-in” experiment where we evaluate the model’s performance using fractions of the training dataset between 5% and 25%. In this experiment, we drop the “<strong>WTL_unc</strong>” for its poor performance.</p><figure id="w-node-21c991b3b9ce-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1bf0be87ae9_1*7MHwyOMtGEauLxja2J9LjA.png"></p><figcaption>Zoom-in experiment: Averaged mAP score for different fractions of the training dataset using 4 seeds.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We see in the results above that the sampled subsets using “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_pt</strong>” methods consistently outperform random sub-sampling. In addition, using only 20% of the training dataset, the “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” sampling method is able to achieve a mAP score of 0.80. <strong>We achieve 90% of the highest mAP score using only 20% of the training dataset</strong>.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Why “WTL_CS” and “WTL_pt” perform better than random sub-sampling “RSS”</h3><p>To answer this question, we make a simple comparison between the images selected with the “<strong>RSS</strong>” method with the images selected with “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_pt</strong>”. For this purpose, we compute the fraction of images from camera 1 in the selected samples for different fractions of the training dataset and for different filtering methods. This comparison is done in both the normal and the zoom-in experiments. Note that in the training dataset, the original fraction of images from Camera 1 is around 20%.</p><p>‍</p><figure id="w-node-75ccc62a0fd7-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1ea99e87aeb_1*lQiGxxeXL_KGcJHNKR1FSQ.png"></p><figcaption>The fraction of Camera 1 images in the sampled images as a function of fraction of the training dataset.</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-d81505eb589c-e7e87989"><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/5f7ac1d59a6fc1624be87aea_1*6qU_7ccA6-ic0C4ZgQWuNg.png"></p><figcaption>Zoom-in experiment: Fraction of Camera 1 images in the sampled images as a function of the fraction of the training dataset.</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>We see that the sampling methods “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_p</strong>t” select more samples from Camera 1 and therefore, they re-balance the sub-sampled training dataset. This explains the gain in performance obtained using different samplings other than random sub-sampling. Since both “<strong>WTL_CS</strong>” and “<strong>WTL_p</strong>t” methods select non-redundant data, they choose more images from camera 1, and therefore the sub-sampled dataset is more diverse.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Summary and outlook</h3><p>In this case study, we have seen the importance of filtering the redundancies within a dataset. We have found the following results:</p><ul role="list"><li>The AIRS dataset contains lots of redundant images.</li><li>Achievement of the highest mAP score using only 85% of the training dataset.</li><li>Achievement of 90% of the highest mAP using only 20% of the training dataset.</li><li>Filtering re-balanced the AIRS dataset.</li></ul><p>This benchmark study showed the importance of filtering redundant data. With Lightly filtering methods, it was possible to achieve <strong>annotation costs reductions between 15% and 80%</strong>. We found lots of redundancies in the AIRS dataset even though it was collected in a controlled environment: There is at least one customer in each video and the customer grabbed different products. We expect the redundancies to be more pronounced in a general uncontrolled case where different customers grab products at a supermarket.</p><p>Anas, Machine Learning Engineer,<br>lightly.ai</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>[…</p></div></div></div></div>

			<p>The most exciting moment of the web application development is a deployment. Your app is going live! It can also be nerve-wracking moment. Unfortunately. There are many options, many variables and configurations. It is easy to miss something … In this article, I will show you how to pack Django and React application into containers and deploy them with <code>docker-compose</code>. The presented approach can be reused on any Cloud Provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, GCP, Heroku) - you just need a Virtual Private Server (VPS).</p>

			<p>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a model of software delivery in which users pay a subscription to get access to centrally hosted software. Nowadays, you can easily build your own SaaS, but you need to have programming skills. There are a lot of open-source web frameworks that allow you to quickly create a web service. You can serve SaaS on rented hardware in the cloud. You can start your own SaaS at 10-50$ per month of total costs (but you need to have programming skills!).</p>

                <p>Ruby 3x3 announced that Ruby 3.0 would be three times as fast as Ruby 2.0. It was an audacious goal, especially for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">a language released in 1995</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 is due to be released in less than a month. They’re hard at work on some of the features, but non-JIT performance is pretty close to release speed. If they pull another 5%-10% speed increase at the last minute (which <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14104">happened for Ruby 2.5</a>!) it’ll be surprising. The current performance is basically the “real” Ruby 3 performance.</p>

<p>So… Did it happen? Is Ruby 3 really three times the speed?</p>

<p>The answer is a little complicated, but overall it’s “yes.”</p>

<p>Now: let’s hit the <strong><em>real</em></strong> answer and the details. That’s the fun part.</p>

<h2>Who’s This Guy?</h2>

<p>Why listen to me? Well, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/noahgibbs/rails_ruby_bench">one of the two official Ruby 3 benchmarks</a>. I <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2016/6/3/ruby-fellow-hired">worked for AppFolio on Ruby 3</a> for about three years. I keep track of this stuff pretty closely. But mostly I’ll be linking to other posts I wrote for <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/">AppFolio</a> and on <a href="https://fastruby.io/blog">FastRuby</a> and maybe elsewhere. They all have open source code. Feel free to check me!</p>

<h2>What’s Performance, Exactly?</h2>

<p>A language doesn’t have one speed. When somebody says “language X is 2.5 times as fast as language Y,” that’s always an approximation. All languages run “sleep” at exactly the same speed, and two of them may use the exact same regexp library. But maybe variable assignment is way faster in one language than another, while the second language is better at optimising away stack variables.</p>

<p>In other words, performance is a million little things that are faster… or they’re slower or they’re the same. We take an average and hand-wave. That’s okay. It’s how humans deal with complicated things.</p>

<p>Benchmarks are all lies because of this. <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/1/7/microbenchmarks-vs-macrobenchmarks-ie-whats-a-microbenchmark">Little operations make for dramatic benchmarks, and big operations make (if you’re lucky) representative “workload benchmarks.”</a> We can’t make a benchmark <strong><em>not</em></strong> lie. We can only pick our favourite lie.</p>

<h2>What’s Our Favourite Lie?</h2>

<p>Here are two favourite lies, embodied by my benchmark (Rails Ruby Bench) and <a href="https://twitter.com/mametter">Mame-san’s</a> benchmark, <a href="https://github.com/mame/optcarrot">OptCarrot</a>.</p>

<p>One favourite lie is this: Ruby performance means Rails performance. How is Ruby 3’s Rails performance?</p>

<p>It turns out it <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/rails/performance/ruby/hows-the-performance-of-ruby-3.0.0-preview1.html">hasn’t changed significantly</a> <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/12/27/ruby-270s-rails-ruby-bench-speed-is-unchanged-from-260">since Ruby 2.6</a>. It also turns out <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/3/7/ruby-speed-roundup-20-through-26">it <strong><em>got far better</em></strong> from Ruby 2.0 to 2.6</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t know the exact final performance of Ruby 3.0. Watch for a benchmark from me in January! But it’s going to look a lot like Ruby 2.6 and Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>And that means a large Rails app’s performance has increased by over 70% since Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear: <strong><em>that’s a lot</em></strong>.</p>

<p>That’s total end-to-end performance to handle HTTP requests in parallel. It uses the same exact Ruby code with the same exact SQL queries, attached to Redis and Postgres and real service with a <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">real big open-source Rails app</a> that people actually use.</p>

<p>In other words, <strong><em>the Ruby part of that performance has increased by a lot more than 70%</em></strong>, because everything that isn’t Ruby is the exact same in my tests.</p>

<p>A lot of a Rails app isn’t Ruby time. It’s waiting for the database. It’s waiting for the disk. The web server is serving static files. A Rails app does a lot of non-Ruby stuff, and it should.</p>

<p>A Rails app wasn’t going to triple in speed. It’s doing too much non-Ruby stuff. Realistically, the Ruby part hasn’t tripled in speed. I don’t have exact numbers, but it would be fair to estimate around 2.5x. It would be very hard to get an accurate only-the-Ruby-parts number, for all kinds of good reasons.</p>

<p>Still, 2.5x is very, very good. Ruby 3.0 will have a big jump in Rails performance, but most people are already using it.</p>

<p>Ractors (a new Ruby 3 concurrency primitive) will also pave the way for later speedups if Rails takes advantage of them. Like threads, it’ll take time and changes to the framework. And right now, <a href="https://www.fastruby.io/blog/ruby/performance/how-fast-are-ractors.html">Ractors’ performance is underwhelming</a>. But they’re also a not-yet-released new feature, so there’s a lot of room to improve.</p>

<h2>Our Other Favourite Lie</h2>

<p>Other than Rails performance, what matters?</p>

<p>One other answer is “straight-line CPU performance on a CPU-intensive benchmark.” And for that we’ll turn to OptCarrot, an <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2017/9/22/optcarrot-an-excellent-cpu-benchmark-for-ruby-3x3">excellent Ruby 3 benchmark</a>. It runs a headless Nintendo (NES) emulator as fast as it can, which is a fun way to measure.</p>

<p>Rails didn’t benefit from <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/7/18/jit-and-rubys-mjit">Ruby’s new-ish opt-in JIT system</a>. MJIT is <a href="https://engineering.appfolio.com/appfolio-engineering/2019/7/19/how-mjit-generates-c-from-ruby-a-deep-dive">a complicated beast</a> with interesting trade-offs. If you turn it on then Rails Ruby Bench gets slower, not faster.</p>

<p>But OptCarrot is exactly what MJIT was designed for and it does really well with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/k0kubun/ruby-3-dot-0-jit-on-rails?slide=9">Ruby 3.0 recently hit 3x Ruby 2.0’s performance with JIT</a>. We’re there. Assuming they can keep performance that good for the actual release, Ruby 3.0 manages 3x the frames that Ruby 2.0 did.</p>

<p>The answer, then, is a straightforward “yes.”</p>

<p>Note that JIT does <strong><em>not</em></strong> “make Ruby three times faster.” It’s that Ruby 3.0, which is already a lot faster than Ruby 2.0, is three times as fast <strong><em>as Ruby 2.0</em></strong> with JIT turned on. It’s fast without JIT, but not a full three times the speed of Ruby 2.0.</p>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<h2>What’s the Score, Then?</h2>

<p>It’s been nearly eight years since Ruby 2.0. There have been a lot of performance changes. The generational garbage collection in Ruby 2.4 is <strong><em>hugely</em></strong> faster than the much simpler 2.0 GC. <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/bootsnap">BootSnap</a> has made bootup in Rails far faster. If you remember back to Ruby 1.8.7 in 2008, Ruby has more-than-doubled in speed to Ruby 2.0, and then tripled again for Ruby 3.0. The OptCarrot results are more like 10x from Ruby 1.8.7 to Ruby 3. A 10x speedup in 10 years? Not bad for a language that just turned 25.</p>

<p>It’s been a long trip. And that’s without going into the other two parts of Ruby 3 — concurrency and type safety, both of which are separate major efforts.</p>

<p>Is Ruby 3 really three times the speed of eight-years-ago Ruby? Day-to-day, yes, it absolutely is. The Rails speedup is more like double than triple in practice since a lot of Rails time isn’t Ruby. But double isn’t bad! And CPU-intensive code is now solidly three times the speed.</p>

<p>You can judge the concurrency and type-safety of Ruby 3 for yourself. But <em>I’m going to call the performance goal a solid success</em>.</p>

<p>Sure, we have to wait a month. Ruby 3 will actually be released on 25th December of 2020. But all the signs are good.</p>

<p>You can also play with <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/09/25/ruby-3-0-0-preview1-released/">Ruby 3.0.0-preview1</a> right now, and I’m sure there will be at least one more before the final release.</p>

<p>Ndarray is the n-dimensional array object defined in the numpy. It stores the collection of elements of the same type. Elements in the collection can be accessed using a zero-based index. Each element in an ndarray takes the same size in memory.</p>
<h2>Create a Numpy ndarray object</h2>
<p>A Numpy ndarray object can be created using <span>array()</span> function. A list, tuple or any array-like object can be passed into the array() function to convert it into an ndarray. The syntax for using the function is given below:</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<div>
<pre>numpy.array(object, dtype=None, copy=True, order='K', subok=False, ndmin=0)
</pre>
</div>
<br><h3>Parameters</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><code>object</code></td>
<td><code>Required. </code>Specify the collection object to be converted into ndarray. It can be list, tuple, set, dictionary etc.</td></tr>    
<tr><td><code>dtype</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify the desired data type. It is used to change the data type of the array element.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>copy</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify True to copy the object, False otherwise.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>order</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify order. It can take four possible values.
<ul>
	<li>'C' - for C order (row major).</li>
	<li>'F' - for F order (column major).</li>
	<li>'A' - unchanged if copy=False. If copy=True, F and C order preserved.</li>
	<li>'K' - unchanged if copy=False. If copy=True, When the input is F and not C then F order otherwise C order.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>subok</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify True to make the returned array sub-classes pass through. By default, the returned array forced to be base class array.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>ndmin</code></td>
<td><code>Optional. </code>Specify the minimum dimension of the array.</td></tr>
</tbody></table><br>

<h3>Example: Create 1-D Array</h3>
<p>In the below example, a list is used to create a 1-D numpy array.</p>

<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
npArray = np.array(MyList)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>

<br>

<h3>Example: Create 2-D Array</h3>
<p>In this example, a list of lists is used to create a 2-D numpy array. </p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
npArray = np.array(MyList)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>

<br>

<h3>Example: Create 2-D Array using ndmin parameter</h3>
<p>A n-dimensional array can be created using <span>ndmin</span> parameter of the array function. Like, in this example, it is used to create 2-D array. </p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
npArray = np.array(MyList, ndmin=2)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>

<br>

<h3>Example: Create 1-D Array with dtype parameter</h3>
<p>The <span>dtype</span> argument is used to change the data type of elements of the ndarray object. </p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np
MyList = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
npArray = np.array(MyList, dtype=bool)
print(npArray)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>[ True False False  True False]
</pre>
</div>

  <div>
    <section>
      <a name="question1"></a>
      <h3>1. What does it mean to be a business in the UK?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <b>In summary:</b> A business is a legally recognised unit producing goods or services and usually paying taxes. They are categorised by a series of defined codes. Business statistics make use of a register, referenced as
          <em>enterprises</em> or they are <em>estimated</em>, this is because some are too small to be registered.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Being a business first invovles a type of registration or formation. There are three common ways people go about doing this in the UK:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals can do business by registering as a <em>sole trader</em>.</li>
        <li>Individuals or groups can incorporate a <em>company</em>.</li>
        <li>Groups can come together and register as a <em>partnership</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are lots more business structures available. People choose a structure that works best how they plan to operate, how many people are responsible and other considerations.</p>
      <p>Due to the variety of ways a business can operate and the need for alignment to the same concepts, the core sets of UK statistics make use of two elements the Inter-Departmental Business Register (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/paidservices/interdepartmentalbusinessregisteridbr">IDBR</a>) and the Business
              Population Estimates <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019">(BPE)</a> to <em>analyse</em> businesses as a whole.</p>
      <p>When using data that uses the IDBR in particular and refering to a single business in the UK, we are actually
        refering to an <em>enterprise unit</em>.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2019">
        <p>
          The term “business” is used to represent an enterprise. An enterprise can be defined as the smallest combination of legal units (generally based on VAT and/or PAYE records) that is an organisational unit producing goods or services, which
          benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making, especially for the allocation of its current resources. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2019">via ONS</a>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>However businesses can be so small that the register may not include them, which is where we can make use of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019">Business
          Population Estimates</a> (BPE):</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/business-population-estimates-2019">
        <p>[As] there is no single database in the UK which contains details of every active
          business. The [BPE] takes data on businesses on the IDBR, and then <em>estimates the number of additional very small businesses
            unregistered for VAT or PAYE</em> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/836574/METHODOLOGY___QUALITY_NOTE_BPE.pdf">via BEIS</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So we can use <em>both</em> these data sets to get a general picture of what's happening in the UK. For more on the differences <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/guide-to-business-statistics">this guide</a> offers a good overview. More detail on the data used is available <a href="https://logikblok.github.io/sketches/ukbusiness/data.html#IDBRandBPE">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Next, we also need to consider Standard Industrial Classifications or (<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">SIC codes</a>). Just like
        the variety of structures there are a large number of things a business can do to meet the needs of it's customers. So to capture what businesses typically do, SIC codes are used to classify economic activites.</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">
        <p>A Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) was first introduced into the UK in 1948 for use in classifying business establishments and other statistical units by the type of economic activity in which they are engaged.<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007">via ONS</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Let's explore some of these now. Press the button below to see an example SIC code and it's description.</p>
      
      <code>
        <p id="sicCode">1110,Growing of cereals (except rice), leguminous crops and oil seeds</p>
      </code>
      
      <p>As you can see the codes have a number and a description. The number code can be used to identify the activities of a business into an area and the descriptions can provide further context.</p>
      <p>These activities are organised into <em>classes or subclasses</em>, <em>groups</em>, <em>divisions</em>, <em>sections</em> and <em>broad industry groups (BIG)</em>. The chart below provides an outline of the breakdown with the number of each
        categorisation level and an example
        using <em>25.91 Manufacture of steel drums and similar containers</em>.</p>
      
      
      <p>Complex businesses can apply multiple SICs to themselves. For example, a software firm might list themselves engaging in design, software
        development, professional services and more. Here's another example using a popular UK super market store:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00519500">
        <p> <em>TESCO STORES LIMITED Company number 00519500</em></p>
        <p>
          Nature of business (SIC):
        </p><ul> 47110 - Retail sale in non-specialised stores with food, beverages or tobacco predominating </ul>
        <ul>47290 - Other retail sale of food in specialised stores</ul>
        <ul>47710 - Retail sale of clothing in specialised stores</ul>
        <ul>47750 - Retail sale of cosmetic and toilet articles in specialised stores</ul>
        <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00519500">via Companies House</a>
        
      </blockquote>
      <p>For the majority of our purposes, we'll mainly be looking at things at the <em>Broad Industry group</em> level which is the highest categorisation available.</p>
      <p>The chart below shows all the Broad Industry Groups (BIG) and their breakdown composition below them. Most BIGs have one <em>section</em> and a number of <em>divisions</em> below them. As you can see Production is the most complex, with two
        layers structured below it.</p>
      
      <p>This higlights an overall indication of how the UK business landscape is structured, at least statistically speaking.
        The SIC hierarchy can be explored <a href="https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html">further here</a>.</p>

      <h3>2. How many businesses are there?</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <b>In summary:</b> As of 2019 over 5.8 million business are estimated to be present in the UK.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The estimation is called out specifically because there are are a vast number of businesses too small to be registered using the IDBR, more detail on the data differences is available <a href="https://logikblok.github.io/sketches/ukbusiness/data.html#IDBRandBPE">here</a></p>
      <p>The chart below shows the difference between the data sets of registered enterprises versus the estimated numbers by industry groups. </p>
      
      <p>The differences above are expected as each data set serves different purposes. However overall both correlate to show similar patterns that the UK has prominent numbers of businesses in industries related to construction and proffesional services.</p>
      
      <p>The chart above shows the total estimated number of businesses highlighting the growth of the UK business population across a six year range.</p>

      <p>As a quick reminder the The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is shaped liked the below. The UK consists of four countries: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>England is split into smaller 9 regions whilst Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are treated as individual regions, bringing up the total number of regions to be <em>12</em>.</p>
      
      <p>The chart below shows the number of businesses by region. It highlights the  higher number of businesses towards the south of the UK with London first, followed by the South East and the East of England.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>The chart below tries to show the regional differences in the concentraion of <em>enterprises</em>. It's using 2019 ONS data on activity and size.
</p>
      
      <p>Couple of interesting points above:

The Business Dictionary defines brand positioning as:</p><blockquote><p>“A marketing strategy that aims to make a brand occupy a distinct position, relative to competing brands, in the mind of the customer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Companies apply this strategy either by emphasizing the distinguishing features of their brand or they may try to create a suitable image (inexpensive or premium, utilitarian or luxurious, entry-level or high-end, etc.)”</p></blockquote><p>If there is a significant gap between marketing strategy and your brand positioning, then that gap is eating up sales and revenue. As this gap becomes smaller, your sales will increase further — its that simple!</p><p>For some context, I’ve worked in marketing for nearly 10 years, with a couple of years in Head of Marketing and CMO roles before starting <a href="https://rhealondon.com/">Rhea London</a> to help brands and businesses reach their goals.</p><p>One thing we pride ourselves on at the agency is generating maximum revenue for our clients in a short time frame. We’ve had good success with this for the first year we were operating, but sales for our clients increased&nbsp;<em>dramatically</em>when we stopped thinking like marketers, and starting thinking like brand managers.</p><p>Branding pioneer, Marty Neumeier (lived in Sillicon Valley since the 80’s and has designed for&nbsp;<em>Adobe, Apple, Hewlett-Packard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Microsoft</em>) emphasises the need to pay attention to the order in which your customer will view your sales proposition (in our case, a Facebook ad). He’s spent decades refining his thinking on this, with the biggest brands in the world.</p><p>When a potential customer sees your ad, there is a moment when their eyes are looking right at you— this is your one and&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;time to shine. Neumeier calls this small window of opportunity ‘<em>the branding moment’.</em></p><p>Neumeier lays out 5 stages of how a customer views a product on a supermarket shelf, with each stage often being entirely subconscious.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_8798"><div><p>There are very few people reading this that will ever need to sell a product on a shelf, but this framework is<em>&nbsp;directly relatable&nbsp;</em>to advertising on social media (I’ll go in to why in a moment). First, the 5 stages:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Shopper notices packaging on shelf — notices strong colours, contrasting tones.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper asks ‘what is it?’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care’</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Looks for more information</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Shopper has decided if they are ready (or not) to consider price and features.</strong></p></li></ol><p>When translated to seeing your ad on Facebook/Instagram this translates to:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Your target customer stops scrolling when they see your ad — strong colours, contrasting tones grab attention.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Target customer asks ‘what is it?’ — your tagline (or headline) should answer this for them.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Asks ‘why should I care?’ — this is where you can touch on their pain points and differentiate your product from your competition.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>This creates the desire for more info — you need to creatively peak their interest and pull them in with a clear why-to-buy message.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They are now ready (and primed) to see your features, prices, guarantees, awards and whatever else will take them over the line.</strong></p></li></ol><p>Putting this into practice may seem straight forward, and you may be reading this thinking ‘but, I already do that’ — well if you take a look at one of your ads right now, with those 5 stages in mind, you’ll likely see a significant gap between points. And what’s important to remember is, if&nbsp;<em>any</em>&nbsp;of those points are weak, your brand positioning is weak — resulting in a breakdown in communication between your ad and your potential customer.</p><p>Okay, so how exactly did we use this methodology to generate <strong>over $100,000 in sales?</strong></p><p>The first step was to turn off all ads and start again.</p><p>We redesigned&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p>New copy, defined new USPs, new tone of voice, new images.</p><p>But for us, what was most important was to first understand what differentiated the products that we were selling, from their direct competitors so that we could effectively communicate this when considering point number 3 above.</p><p>There is one question that has been asked by designers and their marketing counterparts since the dawn of advertising; ‘what drives the customer to buy — logic or emotion?’. Well, it’s both, you just need to be use a clear methodology so that you can maximise sales.</p><h4><strong>Want to discuss how we can help your business?</strong></h4></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607079818241_11110"><div><div><p>We love generating sales &amp; revenue for brands, apps and software products.

																										<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/">Last week, news broke that Google fired the co-lead of its ethical AI team, Dr. Timnit Gebru</a>. Since then, the artificial intelligence community has been taking stock of a host of issues. Chief among them is the intersection of corporate power and research institutions: can a company effectively question its own products? Under the surface of this firing are long-standing and intensifying questions about the ethical implications of artificial intelligence that have yet to fully translate to the wider public.</p>
<p>Dr. Gebru’s departure was precipitated by a paper she co-authored with four other Google employees. The draft paper, titled “On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?” examines the potential multifaceted hazards of a new class of large machine learning models that are widely used by Google and other large technology companies.</p>

Image: Last Futurist</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JeffDean/status/1334953632719011840">Jeff Dean, head of Google AI, stated that the paper was submitted for review with little notice and that it “didn’t meet our bar for publication.”</a> Further, Dean claimed that the paper had overlooked scholarship that mitigated the concerns detailed by Dr. Gebru and her co-authors. The conflict eventually led Dr. Gebru to request a set of specific conditions in order to continue her employment at Google. Dean ultimately declined and interpreted her message as an immediate resignation. Gebru has since explained that she was effectively terminated before she had an opportunity to negotiate the timing of her exit.</p>
<p>The news of her departure has sparked an intense reaction in the tech community.<a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"> As of the time of writing, nearly 2,000 Google employees and 3,000 others have signed a letter of protest to Dr. Gebru’s firing</a>. The letter accuses Google of retaliatory practices and of censoring a line of research that is critical of some of its core products.</p>
<p>Since her firing, Dr. Gebru and her colleagues’ paper has leaked online. Unlike recent years, where we have seen public fretting <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/maximizing-paper-clips/">from figures like Elon Musk</a> that<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2016/06/23/frankensteins-paperclips"> rogue AI would somehow turn the world into paper clips,</a> the paper by Gebru et al. is grounded in present-tense issues. Throughout, I will occasionally refer to Dr. Gebru in the singular for the sake of simplicity; please keep in mind that she had several co-authors on this paper. Their identities are being protected as current employees of Google.</p>
<p>The paper centers around problems that are inherent in a quickly evolving class of artificial intelligence techniques that attempt to model human language. In simplified terms, these models are designed to do one of two tasks: they either predict what comes next after a string of text, or they predict what should go in the middle of a sentence. While this may sound less than exciting, it is massively important—it is a core part of the technology that powers machine translation, automated speech recognition, and virtually anything else to do with language. Imagine something like a sophisticated statistical “Mad Lib” solver and you’re on the right path.</p>
<p>In recent years, these technologies have grown vastly more powerful due to a confluence of factors that constitute a familiar story: ever-larger datasets help to train bigger and more complex models enabled by radical improvements in computer infrastructure.</p>
<p>At present, the largest of these models is OpenAI’s GPT-3. The model uses some 175 billion parameters, and each must be tuned or “trained” on example data via an iterative process. In the case of GPT-3, that data is 570 gigabytes of text data drawn from a variety of sources from the Internet. The previous largest model, Microsoft’s T-NLG announced in February of this year, used less than 10% of the parameters and 30% of the training data. In short, this is a very quickly moving space.</p>
<p>Dr. Gebru and her colleagues ask a straightforward but provocative question: How big is too big? To understand that, we have to look closely at what it means to train a machine learning model.</p>
<p>Machine learning researchers and computer scientists tend to divide calculation of costs between “training” time and “inference” time. Training refers to the process of “teaching” the model on the basis of large datasets. That process is typically iterative; it takes many cycles of repetition to develop a robust model. Researchers must also be careful that the training data is diverse enough that models don’t “overtrain” and become fixated on idiosyncratic patterns.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you have a set of “noisy” points like the black dots below:</p>
<p><img src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png" alt="" width="377" height="256" srcset="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png 377w,https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" data-srcset="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png 377w, https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data-300x204.png 300w" data-src="https://thedebrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Overfitted_Data.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p><p>Your goal is to come up with a function that will predict a new set of points in the future from the same underlying process — recognizing that this particular collection of black dots has some measurement error and uncertainty in it.</p>
<p>The two lines show two possible solutions. The first is a very simple line. While it doesn’t perfectly “fit” the dots, it captures the basic trend. The second is the blue line, which perfectly fits each and every dot, and relies on a more complicated function. If you measure the accuracy of these two models on just this data, the blue line is better. In fact, it is technically perfect.</p>
<p>But is it? You can imagine that over time, with new datasets that won’t have the dots in exactly the same place, the simple line will actually be more accurate. The simple line is less complex, but actually captures the data better by not being overly influenced by just one example.</p>
<p>Finding the right balance in model complexity is difficult work. Too simple, and the model can’t capture important nuances—too complex and it becomes fragile, or at worst a mere portrait of the training data. The goal, as in so many things, is to find the sweet spot in the middle: a tool that is general enough to handle the messiness of the real world without sacrificing too much in terms of accuracy.</p>
<p>Finding that sweet spot often requires vast computational resources, particularly in the modern context. This is partly due to the inherent need for repetition in “teaching” the model, and also the need to ensure that the model doesn’t become too dependent on one narrow slice of training data.</p>
<p>In comparison to training, “inference” — that is, actually using the model to make a prediction — is much cheaper. The expensive part is finding the right values for all those parameters discussed above. Once you have them, making predictions with the model is relatively easy.</p>
<p>If you squint, a rough analogy can be made to raising children. The cost of raising an infant to school age is profound in comparison to babysitting a kid for a day. The hard part is teaching an infant all the basics of human life: not to touch the stove and stick fingers in the electrical sockets. Once the child, or the model, has reached maturity, it “operates” relatively cheaply in comparison to the cost of its upbringing.</p>
<p>This brings us back to Dr. Gebru’s work. One of her arguments is that “raising” AI is expensive in terms of raw energy.

However, Dr. Gebru rightly points out that the wider enterprise of cloud computing is not necessarily carbon neutral, whatever Google’s particular commitments may be.</p>
<p>She further argues that the benefits and costs of these models are lopsided. Is it fair to ask residents of the Maldives, expected to be underwater before the end of the century, to foot the environmental bill for marginally improved language models — particularly when those language models don’t include Dhivehi? In short, the people most exposed to the risks of climate change are some of the least positioned to benefit from technologies like Google Home or Amazon’s Alexa.</p>
<p>Put more pointedly: What good is a Siri that doesn’t understand your language when the water is rising?</p>
<p>Should we hasten the flood so that gadgets become slightly less stupid? How about when such machines do other more important work,<a href="https://thedebrief.org/deepminds-ai-makes-history-by-solving-protein-folding-problem/"> like predicting the structure of medically relevant proteins</a>? To be sure, these are not easy questions — but they are important ones, and ones that should be widely assessed.</p>
<p>Next among Dr. Gebru’s concerns is “unfathomable” training data. Those 570 gigabytes of Internet data referenced above largely come from sources that represent a very narrow slice of society. In the analogy above between training a model and raising a child, imagine a child raised largely by Reddit or Twitter, with occasional babysitting from Wikipedia. Are you confident that a well-rounded, tolerant person would result? Would you take that teenager to an important company dinner, trusting that they wouldn’t say anything offensive or laughably wrong?</p>
<p>The deeper problem Dr. Gebru raises is that the training datasets themselves are too large to effectively audit or even fully understand as a researcher. How can we assess the ethics of something so vast we can’t effectively explore it? The risk, Gebru’s team and others argue, is that by averaging together such sources, models will come to “encode hegemonic worldviews.”</p>
<p>The risk only becomes more pronounced as the models become increasingly convincing. Advances in language models have enabled automated text that seems coherent across sentences and even paragraphs.</p>
<p>Take this example of GPT-3 answering questions about the Russian private military company, the Wagner Group:</p>

				<p><em>Take lessons from high stakes monitoring in the physical world (electrical grids, nuclear power plants, oil rigs, data centers) and apply them to a pure software stack.</em></p><p><em>Karl Lehenbauer is FlightAware</em>’<em>s Chief Technology Officer. </em></p><p>Little is worse for someone committed to providing reliable service than to have your customer call you to tell you your service isn’t working. It’s a double whammy. You’re broken and you don’t know you’re broken. You hate that. So do we. Worse, we have service level agreements with many of our customers— if a service isn’t working for long enough, we have to start dishing out refunds.</p><p>But far more important than that, if we’re down our customers don’t know where their airplanes are. This can be a regulatory violation. It can also mean that the line service technicians aren’t available to meet the plane (if you travel much at all you’ve heard the pilot come on the PA and announce, “Well folks, we’ve arrived but the ground crew isn’t here to help get us into the gate”). Then you sit on the plane in the alleyway until the wing walkers, jetway driver, baggage handlers, etc., show up to guide the plane in.</p><p>But more than that, we provide Global Aviation Distress and Signaling System (GADSS) <a href="https://globalbeacon.aero/">surveillance</a> to lots of airlines as mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization. They might literally not know that one of their airplanes is in distress or has some kind of incident or even has crashed if our stuff isn’t working properly. People’s lives are on the line.</p><p>Let’s go back in time a bit.</p><h2 id="monitoring-the-real-world">Monitoring the Real World</h2><p><br>I got my start in control systems, first at a power company, monitoring and controlling electrical power generation, transmission and distribution. Later, I went to work at a vendor of those systems, followed by a stint at GE Aircraft Instruments working on turbine engine monitoring.</p><p>By the early 1990s I was leading the engineering team for a very early Internet Service Provider.</p><p>One day, our air conditioning failed. The computer room overheated, we lost some disk drives, and I resolved that we should be alerted if it ever started happening again.</p><p>This was before you could read the air inlet temperature off of your high-end router or from your fancy air conditioner or from one of the inexpensive SNMP-enabled temperature monitoring solutions of today.</p><p>So we came up with a clever solution. We’d use an old school thermostat, wire the transmit pin of a computer’s serial port through the thermostat’s mercury switch to the port’s receive pin, and we’d send a character through the serial port every few seconds. If the computer room went above a threshold temperature, the blob of mercury would complete the circuit and we’d start reading the characters back from the serial port. Then our little program would recognize this and start sending messages to peoples’ pagers using a modem.</p><figure><img src="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Image-1-.png 600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1000w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Fine.</p><p>Lo and behold, one day we partially lost cooling in the data center, only we didn’t get any callouts. An investigation revealed that one of the wires had gotten janked, and though the blob of mercury made contact, no characters were received by the monitoring program.</p><p>Meditating on this led to a critical insight. <em>We had it backwards! </em>Rather than completing the circuit when there was a problem, we needed instead to make the circuit normally closed and open it when there was a problem. Instead of wiring into the air conditioning contacts of the thermostat we would wire into the heating ones. We would receive the characters we were sending as long as everything was OK. If the temperature rose past a threshold, the blob of mercury would pull away from the contacts, breaking the circuit, so whenever our program <strong>stopped</strong> seeing the characters, the alarm would be raised.</p><p>By flipping it like this, if one of the wires got inadvertently pulled or whatever, we’d immediately get the alarm.</p><p>In other words, <strong>the lack of a signal telling you everything is OK means something is wrong.</strong></p><h2 id="on-the-trail-of-monitoring-your-applications">On the Trail of Monitoring Your Applications</h2><p>Now, consider we have a service and we want to make sure it’s working. Can I ping the machine or machines? Great. The machine is up. Or is it? Ping is pretty basic in the network stack; ping packets are typically responded to directly from the kernel. We’ve seen machines that are pretty crashed and won’t run programs that will still ping.</p><p>OK, so we’ll ping the machine, but we’ll have some kind of agent program that runs on the machines that we’ll talk to over the network. If we can talk to the agent, then we know a little more that the machine is working. But does the machine have enough storage? Does it have enough memory? OK, we’ll make our agent check and alert us if the machine is low on storage or memory, if the swap utilization is abnormally high, etc.</p><p>But is the program running? Sure, no problem. We’ll add some code to our agent to read the process table and see if the program shows up there. If it doesn’t, we’ll alarm.</p><p>But is the program getting work done? The process might exist, but it might not be doing anything. Well we could read the program’s CPU time repeatedly and see if it’s accumulating time.</p><p>But does that mean it’s working? No, it doesn’t. Maybe it’s lost its database connection. Maybe it’s accumulating CPU time but because it wasn’t written defensively enough, it’s trying to do database updates and failing and logging errors but not reconnecting to the database.</p><p>Maybe it’s got a good connection to the database server but it’s not receiving any messages.</p><p>You can keep increasing the sophistication of your agent. You can keep adding new checks as you discover (usually the hard way) new failure modes you missed, but with this approach you’re vulnerable to any new or unanticipated breakdowns. You might never be completely sure work is getting done.</p><h3 id="in-the-loop-monitoring">In-the-Loop Monitoring</h3><p>I assert that you can’t know your program is doing the work it’s supposed to be doing unless it’s telling you that it is. Call this “in-the-loop” monitoring. If a program is expected to repeatedly receive input messages and update a table in a database, then every time it has done this it should send a message to monitoring software reporting that it has successfully done it.</p><p>It should only send the success message to the monitoring program upon completion of the work. So once an input message has been received, successfully processed, and the database updated, a separate message is sent to the monitoring software saying it has succeeded. If no input message is received or the database update fails, the message should not be sent to the monitoring software.</p><p>To reiterate, you make a call from inside the program to send a message to your monitoring software every time the program succeeds in doing a parcel of work.</p><p>Meanwhile, if a certain amount of time passes without the monitoring program receiving a “work completed” message, it raises an alarm that something is wrong.</p><p>The beautiful thing here is that the monitoring program doesn’t have to know why it didn’t receive a message. We don’t have to try to check for every possible reason. All we have to do is recognize that we stopped being told it was OK. The machine may have crashed, the router may have failed, the program may have lost its receive socket or its database connection. The program feeding data to our program may have stopped sending, the ethernet cable may have gotten pulled, a circuit breaker may have tripped, the program may have divided by zero or gotten a memory protection violation, there could have been an earthquake, a flood… locusts! We don’t have to check for all those things. All we have to do is recognize that the program stopped telling us it was OK.</p><h3 id="watchdog-timers">Watchdog Timers</h3><p>What I’m describing is a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">watchdog timer</a>, technology common in real-time systems, space probes, satellites, etc., where software on a computer periodically resets a hardware timer. The hardware timer counts down, but every time the reset signal is received the counter is reset. If for any reason the software stops resetting the hardware timer, the counter eventually reaches zero and triggers a reboot or some other corrective action. Our variation is much more granular and is software-based, but the principle is the same.</p><h2 id="on-the-trail-of-watchdog-resets-in-the-modern-production-software-stack">On the Trail of Watchdog Resets in the Modern Production Software Stack</h2><p>Now, if your program is processing 40,000 messages a second, it needn’t send 40,000 messages a second to your monitoring system saying it’s completed work. So the watchdog reset subroutine can have a threshold and only send a completion message once a second or whatever, regardless of how many messages it processed. Fine.</p><p>Also, the watchdog reset subroutine must never break the program! So if it can’t reach the monitoring server, the program should keep going regardless. The program shouldn’t freeze if the monitoring software stops responding. For this reason our in-the-loop code has been kept very simple, and uses UDP datagrams to send watchdog resets to the monitoring software. It also makes sure that even if there is an error returned, which can happen even with UDP if the sender and recipient are on the same LAN, that it doesn’t stop or break the program.The watchdog reset message should identify the program, the machine (typically), and perhaps the activity within the program that has succeeded. Examples include the receipt of a message from the FAA, from Aireon’s Space-Based ADS-B network, from our provider of airline schedules, from each of our multiplexing agents that aggregate data from our tens of thousands of ADS-B ground stations, or from <a href="https://flightaware.com/about/datasources/">HyperFeed</a>®, our suite of programs that process all the input data to produce our coherent feed of what is happening with all the aircraft that are in the air or moving on the ground in the world.</p><figure><img src="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-2-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 1000w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Watchdog reset call in Python – If one of our 12M+ users hasn’t logged into the website in the last 15 minutes, something’s wrong.</figcaption></figure><p>Creation of watchdog entries in the monitoring software should be zero config.

<p>In our last piece, we talked about the <a href="https://blog.space.storage/posts/the-dweb-protocols-behind-space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dweb protocols </a>behind the building of Space, and how each of them allows us to take our platform further away from Web 2.0 and into Web 3.0.</p>
<p>One of those protocols is Ethereum, which we think of as the centerpiece of our user’s accounts. We want to tie each user to an ETH key/address, whether they sign up using email and social accounts (via Torus); or by linking their own ETH wallet (via MetaMask or Wallet Connect).</p>
<p>Why? There are many reasons behind this choice. The first and most immediate one is that we think Ethereum keys are the future of authentication. The second one is a long term one. When we think about the future of Space and the Dweb, we see Ethereum as the main connection point for a wide array of tools and use cases that benefit from pairing with a user-owned platform.</p>
<p>Let’s go over a couple reasons and what they mean for us…</p>
<h2 id="exploring-the-future-of-authentication"><a href="#exploring-the-future-of-authentication" aria-label="exploring the future of authentication permalink"></a>Exploring the Future of Authentication</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Enter%20Password.gif" alt="Authentication"></p>
<p>At Space, we’ve discussed several times about what the future of authentication looks like. Whether you sign up using email, social media, or an ETH wallet, we all agree with one thing: public/private key pairs proved to be a solid alternative to passwords, and an overall better authentication model.</p>
<p>So far, key pairs have addressed key issues in the authentication process, and many core negative aspects of the Web 2.0 auth paradigm.</p>
<p>We can see this from the get go if we compare both models. With passwords, authentication is handled from the platform’s end, with the user having to expose their main credentials every time to the platform, who also keeps these credentials on their end.</p>
<p>Key pairs, on the other hand, allow for blind verification of a user’s identity, since they don’t need to expose their private key but sign proof that the platform can verify by just knowing the user’s public key.</p>
<p>This means there’s a lot less instances the user has to worry about when it comes to their credential’s security.</p>
<p>However, we do also understand that key pairs fundamentally change the user’s experience entirely. Generating, saving, and safekeeping keys is not the standard experience everyone, and making a hard switch would mean exposing users to a new model that has its own security needs, and ways of handling/storing/backuping than passwords.</p>
<p>Convenience is a known security killer, and we don’t want users to make sacrifices either in their safety, or their experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Change.gif" alt="Experience changes"></p>
<p>That’s why we’re focusing on finding a place in-between for users to leverage the best aspects of key-pair based authentication, and still maintain a seamless and known login experience. We want to provide a wide selection to cover the spectrum, for both those who simply want to use their email as a login, for example, and those who want to handle their ETH keys with a crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Torus helps us achieve that for the first group, by abstracting key management and letting us provide users with a known sign in experience in the front (using Twitter, or Email magic links, etc.), while abstracting and securely retrieving the users Ethereum private key in the background, via a distributed, non-custodial, sharded key network (the Torus network) that a user can authenticate to with any of their usual, and quick login options.</p>
<p>That way, we can provide a flexible flow for each user without having to grandfather the platform to an authentication model that we think is not the future, and we can build the platform from the ground up so that every user can transition to key-pair auth more easily.</p>
<h2 id="rethinking-account-ownership"><a href="#rethinking-account-ownership" aria-label="rethinking account ownership permalink"></a>Rethinking Account Ownership</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Account%20Ownership.jpg" alt="user-owned accounts"></p>
<p>There’s another reason, other than security, behind our choice to work with Ethereum key pairs.</p>
<p>Today, accounts in services are usually centralized, and tied in exclusivity/ownership to the platform itself, and not to the user. That’s why in Web2 we have an endless stream of different accounts for each service, all bound to the platform’s existence.</p>
<p>We see Ethereum keys as the opportunity to switch accounts from entity/platform controlled to completely user owned and controlled. Where instead of a platform authorizing you to use their platform internally, you -as your own entity- would authorize different platforms to access your own personal account and permission each platform to access just the specific data it needs in order for you to use the service.</p>
<p>In the storage world itself this has a special connotation, because today not only is your account tied to a specific storage platform, but your storage/files/data are as well.</p>
<p>As we move forward towards distributing storage (on IPFS, Textile, Filecoin, etc), we want to give users the chance to truly own their account and storage, and be able to choose how they want to access it, and where.</p>
<p>We view files stored in Space as platform and interface agnostic, and in that vision, Ethereum keys play a part in building user-owned accounts that are not siloed or specific to the Space interface itself, but rather existing on an open global data network (or the user’s hands) for the user to own.</p>
<p>It’s an ever evolving and improving concept, but we are looking to break the traditional way of handling storage, where companies own the data/accounts, and move towards a place where platforms just become interfaces for a user to surface, manage, and interact with their files/data that live on this open global file/data layer (powered by IPFS and Textile).</p>
<h2 id="opening-up-to-ethereum-use-cases"><a href="#opening-up-to-ethereum-use-cases" aria-label="opening up to ethereum use cases permalink"></a>Opening up to Ethereum Use Cases</h2>
<p><img src="https://fleek-team-bucket.storage.fleek.co/Blog%20Inline/Ethereum%20Keys.jpg" alt="ethereum use cases"></p>
<p>The final and longer term reason for using Ethereum keys in our architecture, is to serve as a seamless bridge between Ethereum based use cases, and their potential data/file storage, hosting and access needs.</p>
<p>Ethereum is a melting pot of decentralized use cases and possibilities that benefit a lot from integrating with each other.</p>
<p>From tokens, DAOs, NFTs, to the wonderful array of Dapps that are growing each day, it’s simply natural to think that any of these could benefit from being able to interact directly with distributed and user-owned (or ETH wallet or contract owned) files/data.</p>
<p>For us, Ethereum is the base layer that everything will be controlled from in the future (using ETH wallets or contracts), and so having an ETH key/wallet associated with each user allows us to explore combining and integrating different ETH use cases (tokens, DAO’s, NFT’s, etc.) into Space without having to rebuild the wheel and isolate our platform from an already thriving decentralized environment.</p>
<p>For example, by enabling ETH and ERC20 payments, in the future that could evolve into users being able to seamlessly create paywalls or different access token based mechanisms in front of files or content stored in Space.</p>
<p>Or by taking the “user-owned” nature of NFTs to a new level, and allowing users to store/serve the image/file related to their NFT (which lives on IPFS) in the same account as the token itself (which lives on Ethereum) - rather than just relying on NFT platforms to keep the NFT image/file pinned and existing on IPFS forever.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a lot of exciting opportunities for Space to grow, and for the developer community to build on Space and take some of these ideas to the next level (using the SpaceSDK for web or mobile apps or Space Daemon for desktop apps).</p>
<p>Storage is the cornerstone, and from there, there’s a lot of Space to explore! 🚀🚀</p>

              <article><p>The most notable feature in <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/endbasic-0.3.html">EndBASIC 0.3</a> is its new full-screen console-based text editor. It took longer than I wanted to start developing this, in part because I was busy moving, and in part because I <em>dreaded the thought of having to unit test the text editor</em>. (Yes, EndBASIC is a personal project and I develop it in my free time, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want it to be properly engineered!)</p>

  <figcaption>The text editor we will be unit-testing, in action.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the end, I rolled up my sleeves, got to work, and achieved reasonable test coverage. In fact, the tests have already paid off by uncovering various bugs and inefficiencies, so the effort was well-spent. Developing these tests was non-trivial, though, so here is an overview on <em>why</em> it is worthwhile to unit-test a full-screen console app and <em>how</em> to go about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key insight, unsurprisingly, is to <strong>design for testability</strong>. I knew I wanted to unit-test the text editor from the beginning, so I had to come up with a design that allowed for this. Retrofitting tests into code that never considered testing is very difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, while the specific code I’m going to show you is in Rust, you can easily apply these ideas to your favorite language. All you need is a mechanism to express an abstraction layer between your app and the console manipulation code—and you could do that even in the shell.</p>

<p>Command-line applications typically interact with the console by reading from their standard input (stdin) and writing to their standard output (stdout). Both stdin and stdout are “streams”: you can read from and write to them, but these I/O operations are sequential. The streams do not know anything about where the cursor is or how to change colors or anything like that. And this makes sense because if stdin and stdout are connected to files, what does it mean to “clear the screen”?</p>
<p>If that’s the case, though, how does a console program manipulate the screen to, for example, clear it and position the cursor at an arbitrary location? Well, the answer is that… it depends.</p>
<p>On Unix-like systems, the application writes special collections of bytes, known as <strong>escape sequences</strong>, to stdout. How the escape sequences look like and what they mean depends completely on what stdout is attached to. Again, if stdout is attached to a file, these sequences mean nothing more than a sequence of bytes. Contrariwise, if stdout is attached to a terminal, then the terminal interprets them and performs certain actions.</p>
<p>The most obvious escape sequence you can think of is the line terminator, or <code>\n</code>. On its own, <code>\n</code> is nothing more than ASCII byte 10. But when the terminal sees this byte, the terminal knows that it has to advance the cursor to the next line <em>and</em> move it to the first column. But the semantics of what <code>\n</code> does vary across systems: Windows interprets <code>\n</code> as <em>just</em> moving the cursor one line down, not rolling it back go the first column.</p>
<p>There are more complex escape sequences, of course. This is why you can trivially (assuming you know what terminal type you are talking to) embed escape sequences in <code>printf</code> or <code>echo -e</code> invocations to control how things look like. You essentially use escape sequences as a way to mark up the text:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2020-12-08-escape-sequences.png">
  <figcaption>Two `printf(1)` command invocations showing how escape sequences change the color of the printed text.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For completeness, I’ll also mention that the terminal emulator is usually in the kernel, which is what allows you to have full-screen text apps in the text mode console, but it can also be implemented in <em>hardware</em> (where the concept originated), and thus also in user space, which is what graphical programs like <code>xterm</code> used to do before PTYs (and is why they are called terminal <em>emulators</em>).</p>
<p>If you haven’t connected the dots yet, this is precisely what the ancient <code>TERM</code> environment variable is about: it tells the console applications what specific terminal it is talking to so that the application itself can generate the correct escape sequences to control it. Nowadays, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI escape sequences</a> are almost universal, but they weren’t always. <code>terminfo</code>/<code>termcap</code> and <code>(n)curses</code> are libraries to abstract all these details away and offer the programmer a generic console-manipulation interface that works across <code>TERM</code> variants.</p>
<p>This is all about Unix though. On Windows, things are different (and my knowledge is very limited). Command-line applications communicate with the Console Window Host (<code>conhost.exe</code>) by means of <code>ioctl</code>-like calls. In other words: console manipulation happens out of band and isn’t part of what goes into stdout. Or at least that’s the only way it used to be: the new console host supports ANSI escape sequences too, presumably to facilitate interop with WSL.</p>
<p>Anyhow. We don’t care about how the console is updated from a testing perspective: we want to know how the console changes, but not exactly how that’s done by the OS. Therefore, I’m going to refer to the escape sequences and/or the <code>ioctl</code>s sent to the console as <strong>console manipulation commands</strong> or <strong>console commands</strong> in the text below.</p>

<p>Testing a full-screen console app—which some people refer to as a <strong>Text User Interface</strong> or <strong>TUI</strong> for short—exposes essentially the same difficulties as testing a GUI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are trying to write tests for something that <strong>responds to user input</strong>, and every user interaction causes <strong>changes that are inherently visual</strong> and require the human eye for interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break these problems down into pieces and see how we can approach them.</p>
<p>First and foremost: we have to ensure that the <em>outcome</em> of our input (key presses) has the right effect on the program <em>state</em>. Given that we are testing a text editor, this is easy: we can populate the editor’s buffer with some text, let the editor process a set of key presses, and then verify that the contents of the editor’s buffer match a golden text. Not very different from other, more traditional tests.</p>
<p>Second, we need to worry about user input. After all, the TUI is interactive and reacts to user key presses, so our tests will have to drive the TUI. This is easier than dealing with the visual console updates, as all we have to do is represent the sequence of key presses to send to the app and then feed those to it in some way. Again, this is not very different from other tests: we have an algorithm and we inject some input.</p>
<p>And third, we have to worry about how things look like, which is the most interesting part of this problem. Because, after all… we can write a test to verify that a piece of code selects the blue color and then clears the screen, but unless we <em>see</em> the result, we don’t know if the screen was all emptied with a blue background or not.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>could</em>. Presumably, we could capture the raw screen contents (or poke at them if we were in the DOS era; <code>0xB8000</code> anyone?) and compare those against golden “screenshots” after every key press. This would do the trick and would result in tests that are completely decoupled form the way the screen is updated… which actually sounds like a good idea. The problem with this approach of comparing screen contents is that we would need a terminal emulator to “render” the console from the console commands that the application emits, and a terminal emulator isn’t a trivial piece of software.</p>
<p>The alternative to this idea of comparing screen <em>contents</em> is to capture the console commands that the app emits and compare those to expectations. This is easier to implement but has different fidelity tradeoffs as we shall see below.</p>

<p>If we follow the ideas presented above, we will end up with a bunch of tests that inject key presses into the TUI and, for each of them, we will capture which console manipulation commands were emitted and we will compare them against expectations.</p>
<p>Which… sounds fragile and not particularly useful, doesn’t it? As mentioned earlier, a sequence of commands is meaningless <em>unless we humans see the visual results</em> once a terminal emulator has processed the commands. You could then say that these tests are pointless. But these tests provide three separate benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Corner-case and regression validation.</strong> In the scenario we are looking at, a lot of the editor behavior is obvious: if we press the right arrow key, we know that the cursor has to move one position to the right if the line of text permits. If we break the way this works, the breakage will be extremely visible once we do any kind of manual test.</p>
<p>But… what happens if the cursor is located in the middle of the last visible line of text, with the viewport scrolled to the right because the line was extremely long, and we press enter to split it? That’s not something you usually do, so what’s the expected behavior there? We need to make sure that, once this works as we intend, it doesn’t unexpectedly break, and we don’t want to have to manually verify this every time we change the editor logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavior documentation.</strong> The collection of test cases for the TUI will serve us as the documentation of all cases we must care about in the code if we are doing any kind of refactoring, for example. As illustrated above, there are a lot of corner cases to deal with, and unless they are tracked somewhere, it’s too easy to forget about them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Efficiency measures.</strong> The last benefit these tests give us is a way to measure efficiency. By capturing the sequence of commands emitted by the TUI logic, we can see if those commands are <em>minimal</em>. Because if they are not, the TUI will flicker.</p>
<p>For example: an easy way to implement the TUI is to refresh the whole screen after every key press—and while that will yield updates that <em>look</em> correct (and that would pass a testing model where we verify screen contents), the app will be doing too much work to update the screen. We need to worry about only doing partial screen updates (clearing a single line, using terminal scrolling features, etc.), and to that end, capturing the sequence of commands lets us do that.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The downside of this testing approach is that, again, we …</p></article></div></div></div>

Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema#example">Prisma schema</a> – a declarative data model definition that codifies your database schema.</p><p>This Preview release is the evolution of the Experimental version of Migrate that we released last year. Since then, we've been gathering feedback from the community and incorporating it into Prisma Migrate.</p><h3 id="making-schema-migrations-predictable"><a href="#making-schema-migrations-predictable" aria-label="making schema migrations predictable permalink"></a>Making schema migrations predictable</h3><p>Database schema migrations play a crucial role in software development workflows and affect the most critical component in your application – the database. We've built Migrate to be predictable while allowing you to control how database schema changes are carried out.</p><p>Prisma Migrate generates migrations as plain SQL files based on changes in your Prisma schema. These SQL files are fully customizable and allow you to use any feature of the underlying database, such as manipulating data supporting a migration, setting up triggers, stored procedures, and views.</p><p>Prisma Migrate treads the balance between productivity and control by automating the repetitive and error-prone aspects of writing database migrations while giving you the final say over how they are executed.</p><h3 id="integration-with-prisma-client"><a href="#integration-with-prisma-client" aria-label="integration with prisma client permalink"></a>Integration with Prisma Client</h3><p>Prisma Migrate integrates with Prisma Client using the Prisma schema as their shared source of truth. In other words, both Prisma Client and migrations are generated based on the Prisma schema. This makes synchronizing and verifying database schema changes in your application code easier by leveraging Prisma Client's type safety.</p><h3 id="prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing"><a href="#prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing" aria-label="prisma migrate is ready for broader testing permalink"></a>Prisma Migrate is ready for broader testing</h3><p>Prisma Migrate has passed rigorous testing internally and is now ready for broader testing by the community. You can use it with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. <strong>However, as a Preview feature, it is not fully production-ready yet.</strong> To read more about what Preview means, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/releases#preview">maturity levels</a> in the Prisma docs.</p><p>Thus, we're inviting you to try it out and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4531">give us feedback</a> so we can bring Prisma Migrate to General Availability. 🚢</p><p>Your feedback and suggestions will help us shape the future of Prisma Migrate. 🙌</p><hr><h2 id="how-does-prisma-migrate-work"><a href="#how-does-prisma-migrate-work" aria-label="how does prisma migrate work permalink"></a>How does Prisma Migrate work?</h2><p>Prisma Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema">Prisma schema</a> and works by generating <code>.sql</code> migration files that are executed against your database.</p><p>The Prisma schema is the starting point for schema migrations and provides an overview of your desired end-state of the database. Prisma Migrate inspects changes in the Prisma schema and generates the necessary <code>.sql</code> migration files to apply.</p><p>Applying migrations looks very different depending on the stage of development. For example, during development, there are scenarios where resetting the database can be tolerated for quicker prototyping, while in production, great care must be taken to avoid data loss and breaking changes.</p><p>Prisma Migrate accommodates for this with workflows for local development and applying migrations in production.</p><h3 id="evolving-the-schema-in-development"><a href="#evolving-the-schema-in-development" aria-label="evolving the schema in development permalink"></a>Evolving the schema in development</h3><p>To use the new version of Prisma Migrate, you should have at least version <code>2.13.0</code> of the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation"><code>@prisma/cli</code></a> package installed.</p><p>During development, you first define the Prisma schema and then run the <code>prisma migrate dev --preview-feature</code> command, which generates the migration, applies it, and generates Prisma Client:</p><p><span><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9dee8cc50b930a017447904d95e15e0e82f9a3bf/426d4/blog/posts/2020-12-migrate-development-workflow.png" alt="Development workflow"><span>Development workflow</span></span></p><p>Here is an example showing it in action:</p><p><strong>1.

In other words, the exact steps of the migration are determined when the migration is created, allowing you to inspect the SQL (and make changes if necessary) before running.</p><p>This approach has the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The generated SQL is editable, thereby allowing you to control the exact schema changes.</li><li>The migration is predictable with the exact SQL that will be applied.</li><li>You don't need to write SQL unless you want to change a migration.</li><li>You can perform data migrations using SQL as part of a migration.</li></ul><p>Editable SQL for migrations is useful in scenarios where there are multiple ways to map changes in the Prisma schema to the database, and the desired path cannot be automatically determined.</p><p>For example, when you rename a field in the Prisma schema, that can be interpreted as either deleting the column and adding an unrelated new one or as you renaming the column. By allowing you to inspect and edit the migration SQL, you can decide whether to rename the column (and retain the data in the column) or drop it and add a new one.</p><p>If you're upgrading Prisma Migrate from the Experimental version, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/prisma-guides/prisma-migrate-guides/add-prisma-migrate-to-a-project">upgrade guide</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="whats next permalink"></a>What's next</h2><p>This Preview version of Prisma Migrate lays the foundations for the upcoming General Availability release. Some of the improvements we are considering are improved support for native database types, seeding functionality, and finding a way to make database resets in development less disruptive.</p><h3 id="native-database-types"><a href="#native-database-types" aria-label="native database types permalink"></a>Native database types</h3><p>One of the most requested features in Prisma is support for the database's native types. This release is a step closer to that – however, there's still more work to be done for native types to be fully supported.</p><p>Currently, the Prisma schema can only represent a limited set of types: <code>String</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, <code>DateTime</code>, and <code>Json</code>. Each of these types has a default mapping to an underlying database type that's specified for each database connector (see the mappings for <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql#prisma-migrate">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mysql#prisma-migrate">MySQL</a>).</p><p>In version <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.11.0">2.11.0</a>, we released the <code>nativeTypes</code> Preview feature – the ability to annotate fields in the Prisma schema with the specific native database type that it should be mapped to. <strong>However, the native types preview feature doesn't work with Prisma Migrate yet</strong>.</p><p>Even so, you can still change the types of columns in the generated SQL as long as they are supported, as documented in the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/postgresql#prisma-migrate">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/database-connectors/mysql#prisma-migrate">MySQL</a> connector docs.</p><hr><p>We built Prisma Migrate for you and are keen to hear your feedback.</p><p>We want to understand how Prisma Migrate fits into your development workflow and how we can help you stay productive and confident while building and evolving data-centric applications.</p><p>🐛 Tried it out and found that it's missing something or stumbled upon a bug? Please <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/new/choose">file an issue</a> so we can look into it.</p><p>🏗 Share your feedback about how the new Prisma Migrate is working out for you on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4531">GitHub</a>.</p><p>🌍 Join us on our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://slack.prisma.io/">Slack</a> in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://app.slack.com/client/T0MQBS8JG/C01ACF1DJ1M"><code>#prisma-migrate</code></a> channel for help.</p><p>👷‍♀️ We are thrilled to finally share the Preview version of Prisma Migrate and can't wait to see what you all build with it.</p></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've completed my implementation of an <a href="https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/">IndieAuth v1.1 server</a>, which has been a goal of mine for some time.</p><p>IndieAuth is a great standard for being "OAuth for the Open Web", and within the IndieWeb community, it's seeing some great investment and diversity in use cases. When I was first looking at getting involved in the IndieWeb, I thought that this would be my first project, but instead I ended up going the route of <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/08/26/setting-up-micropub/">creating a Micropub server</a> and <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/09/10/webmentions-on-deploy/">sending Webmentions</a>.</p><p>However, over time, I've found that I am starting to outgrow IndieAuth.com as my hosted server, as there are a few extensions I want to provide that only make sense for me, and it gives me yet another project to spend my time building instead of doing the important things in life!</p><p>As part of creating my server, I wanted to design it with extensibility in mind, i.e. to allow for <code>refresh_token</code> grants, or to allow for different means of authentication.</p><p>I also wanted to make it compliant with the latest version of the IndieAuth specification, as well as take advantage of a few draft RFCs that have been floating around, as an opportunity to see how they feel to work with.</p><p>As mentioned in <a href="https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/11/11/okta-factors-api-passwordless/"><em>Setting up Passwordless Authentication using the Okta Factors API</em></a>, one of the key reasons of building my own IndieAuth server is to tailor my authentication flow to me. This is primarily to make testing with my staging Micropub server easier, but is also so I can authenticate on a device without needing access to i.e. silo accounts for social login, or to go through an email OTP, which is slower.</p><p>I've followed my article and now get a push notification and can allow/deny it, which simplifies things massively! I don't yet have an alternative for when I'm not on my device, however, so there is a single point of failure here, but so far it's made a huge difference.</p><p>Something I took a bit of time to think about (and have <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/www-api/-/issues/295">follow-up work on</a>) is making the consent screen provide me all the information required to provide informed consent.</p><p>I've followed examples from <span><a href="https://aaronparecki.com/">Aaron</a></span> and <span><a href="https://vanderven.se/martijn/">Martijn</a></span> as documented <a href="https://indieweb.org/consent_screen">on the IndieWeb Wiki</a> and have ended up with the following initial version:</p><p><img src="https://media.jvt.me/f34f45fbf0.png" alt="A screenshot of Jamie's consent screen, listing the client's URL, a text box allowing Jamie to specify the profile URL for the user, a bold warning showing that Proof of Key Code Exchange isn't in use, and a list of scopes and what they mean, presented as a tickbox. There is also a button to authenticate via push notification, or to deny the request"></p><p>I've shamelessly adapted Aaron's PKCE-specific warning, but have reversed it, warning the user that they're using a less secure version of the request. In the future, I plan to <a href="https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/www-api/-/issues/298">require PKCE for all clients</a> but with the ability to have an allowlist of clients that haven't yet updated.</p><p>The first thing is that I've experimented with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-par-04">OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests</a> which <a href="https://github.com/indieweb/indieauth/issues/40">is a proposed IndieAuth extension</a>.</p><p>I wanted to play with the ability to pre-authorize requests, for instance rejecting it when there are missing parameters, as well as allowing me to remove the ability to change the URL on the consent page to tweak what the request is for.</p><p>But as current clients do not (yet) support this still-draft RFC and proposed IndieAuth extension, I had to rethink this. I implemented this by taking requests to my authorization endpoint, and pre-authorizing them based on the <code>response_type</code>, and if it succeeded, I would create a pushed request, and redirect to my consent page. For instance:</p><pre><code>curl -i 'https://indieauth.jvt.me/authorize?redirect_uri=http://localhost%3A8080
  &amp;client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-editor.jvt.me
  &amp;state=state
  &amp;scope=create+update+delete+undelete+media
  &amp;response_type=code
  &amp;me=https://www.jvt.me'

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Date: Wed, 09 Dec 2020 09:49:12 GMT
Location: https://indieauth.jvt.me/authorize/consent?client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-editor.jvt.me
  &amp;request_uri=urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:MAuFHnwKR9
</code></pre><p>For my access tokens, I wanted them to be JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), as they're a format I work with quite a lot, and know that I've got a good choice of libraries, and practice implementing with.</p><p>Additionally, I wanted these to be asymmetrically signed, as then it would allow services consuming my IndieAuth server to perform validation of the signature based on a public key, rather than requiring introspection of the access token each time, which simplifies and speeds up the interactions with resource servers (although does have trade-offs once my server can support revocation).</p><p>I've followed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt-10">draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt-10</a> for this, as a way to make sure that I'm aligning with some of the best practices folks are using, and that hopefully will be turning into a standard RFC before long.</p><p>An example of the structure of the token:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
  <span>"typ"</span><span>:</span> <span>"at+jwt"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"alg"</span><span>:</span> <span>"RS256"</span>

  <span>"client_id"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://www-api.jvt.me/post-deploy"</span>

<p><strong>Press release from Back-on-Track, European network to promote cross-border and night trains</strong></p>



<p>The todays press conference on enhanced cooperation between DB (Germany), ÖBB (Austria), SBB (Switzerland) and SNCF (France) introduced an expansion of ÖBB’s NightJet network of night trains, showing the right way forward when it comes to alternatives to flying in Europe. Modern night trains can replace many flights within the range of 500 to 1.500 km, as passengers can sleep while being transported in an environmentally friendly way. Since its founding in 2015, Back on Track has advocated for this transport solution: Night trains are necessary elements in a 24-hour European train network.</p>



<p>Despite our joy at the good intentions and strong ambitions demonstrated at today’s press conference, there is a strong need for the initiative to grow in volume and spread to more regions in Europe.</p>



<p>The cooperation must not be exclusive to those who arranged the press conference. Partners who want to contribute to the future network of night trains must have the option to do so. The EU as a supranational actor can contribute with investments and coordination; but we also call for the participation of railway operators from smaller states, and of private operators who have shown the ability and willingness to introduce their own night train routes.</p>



<p>The regions that also need to be included in concrete plans for new night train services are:</p>



<ul><li>The Iberian Peninsula; with Lisbon, Madrid and Barcelona</li><li>Scandinavia; with Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo</li><li>Eastern Europe; with Belgrade, Budapest and Bucharest</li></ul>



<p>We very much hope that tomorrow’s announcement by the European Commission on “Green Mobility” will show that the EU is a worthy and dedicated partner in the necessary development of Europe’s railways and night trains as a follow-up to what was presented today.</p>

<p><em>Practical tips for identifying when you are over-engineering.</em></p>



<p>A simple way to think about over-engineering is—are you wasting your today for an unknown tomorrow? “Unknown” is the keyword here.</p>



<p>Are you building for a million users—at a time—when a couple of hundred users use your application?</p>



<p>While building features, are you trying to accommodate fictitious(assumed without any basis) future needs?</p>



<p>Are you using technologies that you do not need today, with the assumption you might need them in the distant future?</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_general_problem.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<h2>What leads to over-engineering?</h2>



<h2>Will this scale?</h2>



<p>Is a question software developers keep getting asked. It is a question software developers lose their sleep over.</p>



<p>To mitigate the scaling question, developers tend to over-engineer. From day one, they try to take care of that momentous day when their application will have a million users(they lose sight of the fact that, right now, there are only a couple of thousand users using their application).</p>



<p>Let me tell you a dirty secret—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/12/02/blitzscaling/" target="_blank">scaling</a> is a commodity today; the cloud has made it so. While designing your application, as long as you follow the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/04/28/the-three-pillars-of-scalability/" target="_blank">three pillars of scalability</a>—statelessness, idempotency, and coding to interfaces—scaling is a breeze.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Scaling is a commodity in today's cloud world.</p><p>Acquiring users is not.</p><p>Do not fret over how your architecture will scale for million users.</p><p>Fret over how you can rapidly scale the product to acquire those million users.</p></div>— abhirama (@abhyrama) <a href="https://twitter.com/abhyrama/status/1329877264234913794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>Lure of abstraction</h2>



<p>Software developers love abstraction—it is satisfying to hide the perceived ugliness and complexity of the underlying system in a so-called easy to use, beautiful interface.</p>



<p>There is a thin line between abstraction and over-engineering. Read more about this <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/05/31/when-not-to-abstract/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Future needs</h2>



<p>When developing features, it is intellectually satisfying to feel that what you are creating today will cater to every future use case(irrespective of whether it is needed or not); in pursuing this euphoric feeling, people over-engineer. Instead, build to a rigid scope, assuming that you will need some enhancements and changes in the future.</p>



<h2>Buzz word driven development</h2>



<p>Using technologies that are in vogue today without thinking whether they add value or not. Because someone wrote a blog post about a shiny new technology <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2019/04/10/knowing-versus-doing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">does not imply</a> it will add value to your application stack. Follow the pragmatic school of thought—<a href="http://boringtechnology.club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use boring technologies</a>.</p>



<p>A majority of the bugs that I have seen in my professional career have resulted from over-engineering—bugs arising from using components and technologies that one does not need or understand.</p>



<h2>What is not over-engineering?</h2>



<p>Things you do to increase your time to market is not over-engineering. They might have a one-time cost(when working on them) but will pay off due to the subsequent lower time to market. Automation and <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/01/25/enablers-not-doers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">engineering tooling</a> that focus on <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2019/05/01/competitive-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer productivity</a> fall in this category. It is easy to dismiss these as over-engineering, but they are not.</p>



<p>Anything that makes it easy to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2019/04/16/make-it-small/" target="_blank">ship features faster</a> is not over-engineering(how and what you should do is a nuanced question).</p>



<p>Like any subjective matter, over-engineering is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2018/02/10/context/" target="_blank">contextual</a>—depends on the team, the stage at which the company is in, the engineering culture, the kind of market the company is in, and one’s skills. One man’s over-engineering is another man’s under-engineering.</p>

	<p>The human mind is conditioned to ubiquitously perceive the concept of happiness as something meticulously interlinked with the constructs of virtue. In popular fiction, which is commonly conceived with this consideration, the moral integrity of a character typically determines his or her role and ideological relevance within the framework of a plot. The classic conflict between the abstract extremes of good and evil thus becomes intrinsic to the fabric of stories. However, there are some striking differences in the way different cultures, depending on the historical orientations and sociological phenomenon of their settings, interpret elements relating to the depictions of positive and negative characters and the plot structure of narratives. This contrast is especially fascinating when comparing works that were originally formulated in the East and the West respectively. When aspects like world-­building, symbolism, and frequency of updates are important determinants of a composition’s popular appeal, they portray the social values of its context quite effectively.</p>
<p>The study of cultural production can thus give valuable insight into the streams of cognition associated with creative expression (Morling &amp; Lamoreaux, 2008) and graphic literature, a genre made up of sequenced pictorial panels, can provide the perfect arena to analyse cultural reflections. The study of graphic art is very insightful because, unlike the isolated images depicted in individual pictures and drawings, comic panels are meant to be comprehended in a specifically organized sequence, serving as a literal point of view on the unfolding events. By considering modern American superhero comics and Japanese Shonen manga (both mediums traditionally intended for young boys) as the subject matter of this article and by contrasting their features on specific fronts, we can seek to understand the reflected psychological inclinations of the people they cater to within the limitations of the art form.</p>
<p>The countries of America and Japan have mutually distinct ideals that govern their gestalt recognition of themes like identity, purpose, and aspiration respectively (Fiske et al, 2010). In the field of cross-­cultural psychology, the dimensions of individualism and collectivism, which have great scholarly merit (Cohen, 2009), explain how some societies, largely non­-Western ones, focus on the collective nature of social obligation, while the others, typically Western ones, focus on the primacy of the individual. (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1990). While it’s true that things like imperialism, wars, globalisation, and media, can cause elements of both societies to interact and intermingle in complex ways, the traditional understructure of values still holds a strong psychological grasp on the mindset of individuals and impacts generic preferences. Before proceeding with the article, it must be clarified that manga and comics are stylistically as diverse as any other art form and it would be unfair to the artists if their works are treated as merely representative of the societies in which they are imagined. The aim here is not to establish a dichotomy between two highly developed kinds of sequential art, but rather to extrapolate on the perceivable reflections of certain culturally influential attributes often observed in their illustrations.</p>
<p>For understanding the essence of fictional representations, the prototype theory, proposed by Eleanor Rorsch (1999), is integral in defining the process of cognitive social categorizations. This theory claims that it is context that determines the meaning of a word, and thus what conditions are in place at a particular moment primarily define a given idea (Fox, 2011). The qualities of a concept are interpreted as being incidental, rather than inherent, and this permits difference without the elimination of similarity. Hence, a study of prevailing archetypes is logically the best way to continue with this comparison due to its flexible nature and theoretical foundation. According to a study conducted in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Hong, Morris, Chiu, &amp; Benet­ Martínez, 2000) there are certain dynamics through which specific pieces of cultural knowledge become operative in guiding the construction of meaning from a stimulus. Whether a construct comes to the fore in a perceiver’s mind depends on the extent to which the construct is highly accessible. Thus, the archetypes that individualist<br>
and collectivist societies perpetuate are vastly dependent on the external, cultural elements the people internalize and become accustomed to. Deriving a correlation between the two thus has some validity from an analytical perspective. With that in mind, we can now seek to deconstruct the key features of both manga and superhero comics with relevant historical details and psychological research.</p>
<p>The archetype of the Hero has been predominantly masculine in both Western and Eastern media, mostly due to the insidious nature of patriarchal norms that rule social dynamics universally. In conceptualising superhumans, the most fundamental notions of what constitutes greatness by the masses is acutely translated. The very basis of the construction of these beings is an innate superiority over the weak personality of the actual man. The sub-­genre of superheroes, which primarily deals with the creation of characters like these, is thus brimming with intricate romanticization of human virtue strongly filtered through cultural biases.</p>
<p>The Western version of the hero archetype evolved alongside the revolutionary development of democracies and the sweeping away of traditional social arrangements. Where the rubric of hero was once largely limited to warrior princes, righteous priests, and Olympic athletes, the heroic pantheon slowly opened up to the personality of any person who could distinguish himself strikingly from the rest (Kendrick, 2010). The focus was now on the natural potential of a person to rise above all odds and achieve triumph over his own “destiny”. This capitalistic conviction paved the way for highly idealistic, almighty heroes like Superman, an invincible alien in a cape with the genetic capacity to do virtually everything that common man desired to do, but couldn’t due to physical limitations. However, alongside the democratisation of the heroic ideal, there was also the demonization of the same archetype due to totalitarian movements like Fascism and Bolshevism rising around the world. The tradition of the anti­-hero consequently came into existence, countering the original beliefs of what a hero must be. It celebrated slackers, survivors, indeed any character who conveyed how mundane, inglorious options like tending your own gardens, keeping your head down, and trying to stay alive were actions worthier of valour than martyrdom. Comic book characters like Deadpool and Wolverine, who subvert numerous tropes simply by existing, are relevant examples of this phenomenon. The post-­war versions of the more traditional superheroes were also structured along these lines due to the sardonic and whimsical tastes of the millennial audiences.There are many other tropes that can be observed within the premises of western beliefs: the hero is frequently an explorer, an outcast, a vigilante, a survivor, a rogue, or just a weird entity. However, what is particularly notable is that he is nearly always independent, even in arcs pertaining to personal themes like self discovery and existentialism, and beyond the realms of common society. The element of a mild­-mannered alter ego that conceals his superpowers and conforms to the satirically dull depictions of “normal life” provides a consistently amusing foil for the awesome reality of the hero in the plot. A number of different back stories, assigned to both villains and heroes almost in the likeness of folklore and mythology, give them an epic and tragic dimension, rendering a new mould to the classic Greek heroes of the past. Alexis De Tocqueville (1805­-1859) defines individualism as “a calm and considered feeling which disposes each citizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows”. The charismatic, competent, self­righteous, aggressively stoic, and “above the law” persona of the Western hero thus stands iconic and vastly interpreted in confirmation of this proposition.</p>
<p>The antagonists, or the “super villains” in superhero comics are often posed as arch enemies of the hero and represent the counter­force for the positive ideological solidarity the hero essentially stands for. They commit evil for goals like anarchy, vengeance, indiscriminate power, and frequently resort to their own dastardly talents, high tech weaponry, and swarms of simple­minded minions to achieve their destructive ends. They often have complex motivations, psychological depth, and grey tonalities that establish them as characters as significant as the heroes. Robert A. Heinlein (1982) insightfully notes that for every superhero to be relevant, there must be a supervillain to give him purpose. With that philosophy of paradoxical co-dependence, the conflicts in comic books transcend a simple plot narrative, and represent much bigger, more convoluted conflicts between good and evil.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Japanese value system idealises a hero dedicated to “getting better” and reaching his goals through determination, rather than because of pure natural strength. “Yamato­damashii” is a term that loosely translates into “the spirit of Japan”, and defines the core of Japan’s ethics and psychological predispositions. It was abused quite intensively in World War 2 propaganda, for inspiring men to fight and die for their nation in the name of honourable self-­sacrifice and undaunted loyalty (Yamakuse, 2016).<br>
Japanese culture is rooted deeply in a clan hierarchy where every person has a rank within their family, community, organisation, and class. By following the means prescribed by Yamato­damashii, …</p></div></div>

      <section>
        <p>In my <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">last post</a> I examined how first principles thinking fails. This post is going to be about a single, concrete example — about an argument that started me down this path in the first place.</p><p>A couple of months ago, a friend sent me a blog post titled <em><a href="https://ensorial.com/2020/dont-raise-money/">Startups Shouldn’t Raise Money</a></em>, over at a website called ensorial.com. I thought that the post was tightly argued and reasonably put together, with each proposition leading logically and coherently to the next. I also noticed that the author had taken the time to construct their argument from first principles … which meant it was difficult to refute any individual clause in their chain of reasoning.</p><p>But I also thought it was wrong. I told my friend as much.</p><p>“How is it wrong?” he immediately challenged.</p><p>“Well …” I began. And then I stopped. I realised I didn’t have a good argument for <em>why</em> it was wrong. Every axiom and intermediate proposition were ideas that I agreed with. And it wasn’t so simple as the conclusion being flat out mistaken — you <em>could</em> probably run a small, successful internet business using the ideas laid out in the posts’s argument (internet-based businesses tend to be simpler to manage, and there are many niches you can occupy).</p><p>But I felt uneasy because I thought the framing wasn’t as <em>useful</em>. This was a more complex thing to debunk.</p><h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2><p>It’s easy to think that arguments have just three terminal truth values: right, maybe, and wrong. In practice, arguments (and in particular, the sort of argument that we use to justify actions) have many possible truth values. These include things like ‘got the details wrong, but is by-and-large correct’, or ‘is correct but for a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-right-level-of-abstraction/">different level of abstraction</a>; doesn’t apply here’, or ‘is partially correct, but isn’t as useful compared to a different framing of things.’ The ensorial.com piece is interesting because I think it is an instance of that last one. It was what pushed me to start thinking about all the various ways first principles thinking could go wrong.</p><p>The author’s argument unfolds as follows:</p><ol><li>Startups are risky.</li><li>Raising capital to do a startup reduces skin in the game (you’re spending other people’s money, after all).</li><li>Once you have less skin in the game, it is easier to make bad decisions. The author argues this is due to a) having a capital buffer to cushion you, and b) having more time to waste.</li><li>The alternative is to forego raising venture capital and to create a sustainable business from the beginning, ‘growing linearly with the number of people that give you money for your product.’</li><li>This aligns incentives: you grow only by solving customer problems that they would pay you for. And you’ll pick the shortest path, because you don’t have the luxury of time given to you by an infusion of other people’s money.</li><li>Therefore: startups shouldn’t raise money.</li></ol><p>At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anything that’s explicitly <em>wrong</em> with this argument. I agree with all the base ideas, and I found myself nodding to the intermediate propositions. The logical correctness of the argument wasn’t a problem. No, my unease stemmed from experience: I <em>knew</em> this wasn’t the right way to think about raising capital. But I couldn’t begin to construct an argument that went against it.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/argument_chain.f369ba07141442ea959636c21f56e207.png" alt=""></figure><p>My friend and I spent no more than 10 minutes discussing this piece. But in the months after our conversation, I continued to return to the author’s argument. I thought it was interesting because it represented a type of thinking error that you and I are likely to encounter in our lives. The form of the error is subtle, and therefore more difficult to detect; the best description I have for it is: ‘perfectly rational, logically constructed, and not really <em>wrong</em> — but not as useful or as powerful as some other framing.’</p><p>Of course, my obsession was for instrumental reasons: how might you recognise a better framing when you found one? I’ll admit that I was a little naive here: I thought that if I could generalise the structure of this argument, I would be better able to recognise similar errors in the future. Alas, I have not been able to do this to my satisfaction.</p><p>(In practice, most of the older entrepreneurs I know seem to understand the problems with such sensemaking. Plausible arguments are dealt with in a simple manner: you try the recommendations that unfold from the analysis, but you remain alert to see if they give you exactly the results you want. If they don’t, you keep the frame for the time being, but you continue to look out for a better explanation. And how would you know if you have found a better way of thinking about your situation? Simple: you listen carefully. In the words of Malaysian magnate Robert Kuok, “you learn to distill wisdom from the air.”)</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The most I’ve been able to do is to articulate <em>how</em> the author messed up — and therefore how first principles thinking may fail — something that I <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-first-principles-thinking-fails/">explored in my previous post</a>. The core idea is simple: I believe the author started from a limited set of axioms. If you start from a wrong set of axioms, you would eventually end up with a flawed conclusion. In this case, I think the ensorial.com author started from a deficient understanding of business.</p><p>To generalise a little, people with limited understanding of business think that business is all about making profits. But those who actually run businesses know that running a business is all about managing cash flows.</p><p>And the ensorial.com author’s argument fails because he doesn’t appear to understand this.</p><h2 id="john-malone-and-the-invention-of-ebitda">John Malone and the Invention of EBITDA</h2><p>In 1972, a 32 year old man named John Malone was offered the top job at Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), a cable company. He took charge on April Fool’s Day, 1973.</p><p>At the time of his hiring, Malone was president of Jerrold Electronics, a division of General Instrument that supplied cable boxes and credit to the cable systems companies. He had been offered the Jerrold Electronics job when he was 29 years old, just two years earlier. Before JE, he was at McKinsey Consulting. And before McKinsey, he had a job at AT&amp;T’s famed Bell Labs, where he applied operations research to find optimal company strategies in monopoly markets. Malone concluded that AT&amp;T should increase its debt load and aggressively reduce its equity base through share repurchases — a highly unorthodox recommendation at the time. His advice was delivered to AT&amp;T’s board and then promptly ignored.</p><p>Malone had been thinking about the interplay between debt, profit, cash flow, and corporate taxes for some time. In 1972, when he was first offered the TCI job, he had already noticed a number of structural properties in the cable industry that piqued his interest:</p><ol><li>The cable industry had highly predictable subscription revenues. Cable television customers in the 60s — especially those in rural communities — were eager to upgrade to cable for better TV reception. These subscribers paid monthly fees and rarely cancelled.</li><li>Cable franchises were essentially a legal right to a local monopoly, which meant that cable system operators had limited competition once it established itself in a given locale.</li><li>The industry itself had very favourable tax characteristics — smart cable operators could shelter their cash flow from taxes by using debt to build new systems, and by aggressively depreciating the costs of construction. Once the depreciation ran out on particular systems, they could then sell them to another operator, where the depreciation clock would start anew.</li><li>Most importantly, the entire market was growing like a weed: over the course of the 60s and into the start of the 70s, subscriber counts had grown over twentyfold.</li></ol><p>Of course, Malone didn’t have much time to reflect on these observations. He landed at TCI and found the company at the brink of bankruptcy.</p><p>Bob Magness, the founder of TCI, had grown the company over the course of two decades using a ridiculous pile of debt — about 17 times revenues, at the time of Malone’s hiring. Malone spent his first couple of years at TCI fighting to keep the company alive. He flew into New York every couple of weeks, hat in hand, renegotiating <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/covenant.asp">covenants</a> and asking for extensions on debt repayments. At one point during a meeting with TCI’s bankers, Malone threw his keys on the table and threatened to walk, leaving the company to the banks. The bankers capitulated, granting TCI a much needed extension.</p><p>Malone and Magness also had to worry about hostile takeovers, given TCI’s low stock price in the early 70s. They executed a series of complicated financial manoeuvres a year or so after Malone took over, placing a large chunk of stock in a holding company to grant them majority control. Later, they created a separate class of voting stock. These moves gave them hard control of the company, allowing Malone the freedom to focus on righting its finances.</p><p>After three years of hell, TCI was finally pulled back from the brink of financial disaster. And then Malone got to work.</p><p>Malone understood a few things about the cable industry that many outsiders didn’t. First, he understood that cable was like real estate: incredibly high fixed costs up front as you built or bought the systems, and then highly predictable, monopoly cash flows for a long time afterwards. He understood that if he used debt to finance acquisitions, he could keep growing the company, and use the depreciation on acquired systems (plus the write-offs from the loans itself) to delay paying taxes on that cash flow. Third, Malone understood that untaxed cash flows from all of those cable subscribers could be used to a) service the debt, b) pay down some of those loans — only when necessary; Malone wanted to keep the debt-to-earnings ratio at a five-to-one level — but more importantly c) demonstrate to creditors that TCI was a worthy debtor. And finally, Malone understood the benefits of size: the larger TCI got, the lower the cost of acquiring programming (i.e. shows and programs), because it could amortise those costs across its entire subscriber …</p></section></div></div>

December 9, 2020 | https://swimm.io/blog/supabase-get-started-with-vue/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swimm.io/blog/supabase-get-started-with-vue/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-2e5fa7b3=""><section data-v-0e03be84="" data-v-2e5fa7b3=""></section> <section data-v-2e5fa7b3=""><div data-v-2e5fa7b3=""> <!----> <div data-v-2e97bb82="" data-v-2e5fa7b3=""><div><p><a href="https://supabase.io/">Supabase</a>, a recent Y Combinator graduate company to watch, is an open-source Firebase alternative that is quickly gaining popularity in the IT space. It is basically a suite of tools that have been stitched together to provide functionality and performance that is on par with the competition.</p>
<p>At the virtual <a href="https://twitter.com/saucedopen">Open Sauced Community</a> event, held during Hacktoberfest in partnership with Swimm, <a href="https://twitter.com/kiwicopple">Paul Copplestone</a> Supabase CEO, joined to discuss Supabase and open-source solutions with Github Dev Rel <a href="https://twitter.com/bdougieYO">Brian Douglas</a>, sharing some tips and&nbsp; insight about the project and how to get started.</p>
<p>One prominent advantage of Supabase is its flexibility. With organizations today eager to scale up on-demand and improve their time-to-market, this open source solution answers this need without sacrificing the functionality offered by Firebase. Add in the user-friendly interface and you have a winning formula.</p>
<p>Note, Supabase is currently not offering all the features that you can find on Firebase, but you can definitely use it to track your database changes, query your tables, and manage your user permissions giving you enhanced visibility into your database.</p>

<p>...</p>
<h2>Supabase: How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>In the talk with Brian Douglas, Dev Rel @ Github, Copplestone mentioned trying existing open-source tools wherever possible and wrapping around it the easiness that Firebase has.</p>
<p>Check out the entire event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmiWXDx9-w&amp;feature=emb_title">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative, so we're building the features of Firebase but we're using open source tools. We try to use existing open source tools wherever possible. We tried to identify a nice scalable enterprise-grade open source tool for one of the features that Firebase has, and then we wrapped the easiness of Firebase around it". // Paul Copplestone, Supabase CEO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is most prominent in their database system which started with PostgreSQL, which is the relational database for Supabase with NoSQL.</p>
<p>The only thing that is not open-source so far is the dashboard. It has an air table view built on top of PostgreSQL, it has a SQL and Auto Auth.</p>
<p><img src="https://swimm.io/media/screen-shot-2020-12-03-at-23.06.51.png" alt="Supabase Features"></p>
<p>Supabase has a feedback widget in the dashboard on the top right, when you are logged in, you can just drop a note and once you do that it is received on the Slack and you can chat with the team directly. If you have any problem, the team can debug them with you. This is a great way for Supabase to squash these bugs, have 5-9s uptime, and stay forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have actually used Supabase to build Supabase. You finding bugs is helping the platform so it is great to have the community in our corner.” // Paul Copplestone, Supabase CEO</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>The Future of Supabase</h2>
<p>Actually, Supabase just got to the tail-end of the Alpha working on stability and launched it's beta version today (3 December 2020) -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 9 months of building, 3102 databases launched, 505 issues fixed, and 238,000 lines of code written - we're moving into Beta.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently focused on three parameters - Security, Reliability and Performance. Reliability especially now on APIs spent and locking down the new developer experience around the API.</p>
<p>“The only thing that may be called out as a caveat”, mentions Copplestone, “is that we only have JavaScript libraries so you can use every React native but you might have a hard time using it within the other mobile platforms.”</p>

No wonder more and more entrepreneurs and politicians are looking into the advantages new technologies can bring into healthcare not from the top of the chain, but from the bottom of it.</p><p>Yet instead of fantasizing about how technology can potentially change the healthcare landscape, we at EGO custom web development company like to look into businesses that are already disrupting the industry and reinvent the way medical services can be provided.</p><p>Not only can it inspire the next wave entrepreneurs to make their contribution to the ways people take care of their health, but also reveal that all required technologies are already here. Here’s what Andrew Schwinger, one of the founders of the Digital Healthcare Revolution podcast and a business developer, thinks about the future of this industry:</p><p><em>“The growth of software enthusiasts and engineers during the past 20 years has led to so many technological breakthroughs for healthcare. There are blockchain, machine learning, 5G, AI, nanobots.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Now it’s time for businesses to build usable products and services on top of them. It is only through competition that the stagnant healthcare market might have a new heyday.”</em></p><p><em>Andrew Schwinger, APAC Business Development</em></p><p>As a long-standing custom web application development company, we'd like to show and prove that even fairly new businesses can hop on the train of the future healthcare reforms.</p><h2>Red Tape, Data Mining, And Drugs</h2><p>Let's start with the performance optimization.</p><figure id="w-node-98dc4ea4d775-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HL4Rz9YoPAA"></iframe></p></figure><p>One of the problems leading to low productivity of healthcare workers is red tape and managing data silos. Using blockchain technology, <a href="https://www.embleema.com/">Embleema</a> seeks ways to help patients securely share their medical data with doctors, scientists, and other entities. Somewhat related, <a href="https://www.tempus.com/">Tempus</a> reuses data from previous patients so it could be used by current ones.</p><p>After organizing the existing data, there's always an opportunity to collect even more data for better decision making. For instance, <a href="https://www.khealth.ai/">K Health</a> collects anonymous data to get insights for better management of people's medical conditions. And <a href="https://www.prognos.ai/">Prognos</a> interprets clinical data to predict diseases early, find care gapes, indicate risks, and more.</p><p>Another direction in healthcare that gets the entrepreneurs attention often is drugs. <a href="https://www.vergegenomics.com/">Verge Genomics</a> takes advantage of AI to calculate which drugs will have more chances to succeed in trials and hit the market. On the contrary, <a href="https://healx.io/">HealX</a> leverages AI to analyze the current drugs and see if they can be repurposed for treating patients with rare diseases.</p><h2>Telemedicine, Remote Health, and Automated Conversations</h2><p>Due to COVID-19, more and more people are considering having appointments online . This is what telemedicine is about, and there's, of course, <a href="https://www.doctorondemand.com/">Doctor On Demand</a>, that aims to make remote healthcare mainstream. Since it's an 8-year-old platform, you have probably heard about it, but last year they’ve also launched <a href="https://www.doctorondemand.com/businesses/health-plans">Synapse</a>, a platform that integrates their services with US health plans and employers networks.</p><figure id="w-node-88c4c1d1039e-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z7__9lwyMfk"></iframe></p></figure><p>Another prominent platform is <a href="https://uber-docs.com/">UBERDOC</a>, which EGO Creative Innovations (as a website application development company) helped develop. It's a web platform for patients and doctors conceptually similar to Uber. It allows a network of healthcare physicians to offer their services and patients to find and meet them within 24 hours, for a flat fee. You can learn more about our partnership in our <a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/uberdoc">UBERDOC&nbsp;case study</a>.</p><p>However, during the quarantine, not only an appointment can be had online, but also a day-to-day screening. A company named <a href="https://www.ekohealth.com/ai">Eko</a> delivered a platform able to monitor patients' vital signs remotely and detect lung and heart problems early. This is possible thanks to a number of sensors, machine learning algorithms, and AI. And there are also <a href="https://www.aluna.uk.com/">Aluna</a>, <a href="https://www.myiahealth.com/">Myia</a>, <a href="https://www.biofourmis.com/">Biofourmis</a>, and other companies out there offering similar solutions.</p><p>Being pre-screened on your own, you don't need to consult the doctor on every health issue you may suffer from. But wouldn't it be great to be able to find out if it is serious enough to contact the physician? This is where the AI-based conversational interfaces come in handy.</p><p>Basically, they help automate care navigation and patient screening. <a href="https://www.babylonhealth.com/">Babylon Health</a>, for instance, has a symptom checker that, among other things, lets you figure out if you have COVID-19 and suggest next steps. However, it only works in the UK and Rwanda, so other notable companies in this area are <a href="https://www.curai.com/">Curai</a>, <a href="https://www.memorahealth.com/">Memora</a>, and <a href="https://gyant.com/">Gyant</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Treatment, Precision Medicine and IoMT</h2><p>When it comes to treatment, multiple companies are seeking opportunities to increase its effectiveness. <a href="https://baylabs.io/">Caption Health</a> is focused on cardiovascular disease, while <a href="https://www.greensunmedical.com/">Green Sun Medical</a> digs into treating Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis and Kyphosis:</p><p>&lt;Insert a video here: <a href="https://youtu.be/9xCKN7EuEbM">https://youtu.be/9xCKN7EuEbM</a> &gt;&nbsp;</p><p>The other way to improve treatments is precision medicine. Considering such factors as demographics, genetics, and drug levels, <a href="https://insight-rx.com/">InsightRX</a> seeks ways to forecast a patient’s individual response to a suggested treatment. And <a href="https://www.axial3d.com/">Axial3D</a> takes advantage of 3D printing to help medical staff better understand unique abnormalities and come up with novel surgical techniques.</p><p>And then there are numerous specific devices united under the umbrella term of Internet of the Medical Things (IoMT): from the <a href="https://www.companionmedical.com/InPen">InPen</a> smart injectors and the <a href="https://www.medicsen.com/en/">Medicsen</a> smart patches for drug delivery to chronic disease monitors from <a href="http://healthcareoriginals.com/">Healthcare Care Originals</a> and the <a href="http://elfi-tech.com/">Elfi-Tech</a> remote health stations.&nbsp;</p><p>At our web development services company, we believe that someday there will be a specialized technological platform uniting devices, screening methods, and innovative treatment programs that'll help patients maximize their chances of recovery.</p><h2>Bottom line</h2><p>For sure, there are many more companies out there. Some are improving the existing patients screening tech, others seek ways to help people unite into communities for various purposes.</p><p>Yet our goal was not to list the variety of businesses out there, but rather to show how the technology can change the way patients interact with the healthcare system so that the system itself could get changed.</p><p>Hopefully, the more people will use automated services to pre-screen themselves, book a consultation, follow the treatment plans, and report their vital signs via various devices, the more time and resources will appear to finally start optimizing the physicians' routine, get rid of red tape, improve the quality and speed of services provided and ultimately decrease its cost.</p><p>So it is still in the hands of visionaries and entrepreneurs to turn those possibilities into reality. And as a healthcare-focused business web application company, we’re happy to lend a hand in all things tech-related.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5f9ae10759b2f2f7d16ffaff_oGB7Otc4hyAeiAnh51cjs2_7lqQIarFAOl444Qr4yaXCPARrP-5wfaSKpbWWpCHP2RbmWJnHlj8LupHw8qJqPvLXTaXoZEgoGWshS5uSV3ygOFY8igt7IlV_RgTjKA-A0pkQi0Sn.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p></div></article><section><div><div><p>LIKE THIS ARTICLE?

<p>Download size is the compressed size, JavaScript size is uncompressed. Main Content is the time when e.g. the Cloud Functions become visible, Fully Loaded is when no more changes are made to the UI.</p>

<p>We can see that each page loads over 15 MB of JavaScript code. A look at the performance timeline in Chrome DevTools confirms that running this code is the primary cause of the poor page performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/timeline.png" alt="DevTools CPU timeline showing a large amount of JavaScript work"></p>
<p>This article will take a closer look at the page load process of the Google Cloud Functions page, and examine how it could be sped up.</p>
<p>You can use these strategies to investigate and improve the performance of the apps you're working on.</p>
<h2 id="loading-the-html-document">Loading the HTML document</h2>
<p>The initial HTML request is very fast and only takes about 150ms. It contains an embedded SVG spinner that shows while the first chunk of JavaScript code is loading.</p>
<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="">
    <source src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/gcp-spinner.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<h2 id="loading-the-initial-java-script-bundles">Loading the initial JavaScript bundles</h2>
<p>These are the first two JavaScript bundles the page starts loading.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>routemap</strong> 21 KB (103 KB uncompressed)</li>
<li><strong>core,pm_ng1_bootstrap</strong> 1.3 MB (4.8 MB uncompressed)</li>
</ul>
<p>These files don't take too long to download, but running the code freezes the UI for a while. The spinner SVG becomes stuck at this point, until it's replaced by a skeleton UI for Google Cloud Console page.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/gcp-initial-load.png" alt="Filmstrip showing initial rendering of the GCP page"></p>
<p>Here's what happens when the browser wants to run some JavaScript code.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parsing</strong> (done lazily at first, and then as needed later on)</li>
<li><strong>Compilation</strong> (also happens lazily)</li>
<li><strong>Initialization</strong> –&nbsp;the browser runs module initialization code, i.e. code that runs when loading a module rather than when calling one of its functions</li>
<li><strong>Running core app code</strong> – renders the application using the initialized modules</li>
</ol>
<p>For the whole Google Cloud page, just parsing the source code takes 250ms, and compilation takes another 750ms (not including the 113 ms spent on "Compile Script").</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/devtools-profile.png" alt="DevTools profile showing a breakdown of CPU activity"></p>
<p>The initial render of the Angular app takes about 1s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/initial-bundle.png" alt="JavaScript execution flamechart"></p>
<p>Eventually we start to see a new spinner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/second-spinner.png" alt="Page frame and new spinner"></p>
<h2 id="loading-page-bundles">Loading page bundles</h2>
<p>Once the generic Google Cloud UI is rendered the page starts loading 18 additional JavaScript files with an overall size of 1.5 MB.</p>
<p>Making a lot of separate requests isn't actually a problem though – it can improve performance by increasing the likelinhood of cache hits, and splitting up bundles makes it easy to load only necessary code.</p>
<p>After loading the first set up bundles the app starts making fetch requests and loads 3 more bundles at a total size of 6 MB.</p>
<p>When loading the page on my normal network the requests all kind of blurred together and it was hard to see which requests were sequential. So this screenshot shows the request chart on a throttled connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/more-page-bundles.png" alt="Request waterfall showing three sets of JavaScript being loaded sequentially"></p>
<h2 id="loading-the-list-of-cloud-functions">Loading the list of Cloud Functions</h2>
<p>The request loading the list of Cloud Functions takes about 700ms. But it doesn't start as soon as the bundles are loaded, in part because there's a <code>testIamPermissions</code> request that needs to finish first.</p>
<p>As a result the CPU ends up being idle for half a second –&nbsp;this time could be used better if the request started sooner.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/loading-functions.png" alt="Waterfall showing requests made to load the list of cloud functions"></p>
<p>Finally the app re-renders and we get the list of Cloud Functions we wanted to see.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/cloud-functions.png" alt="Page showing GCP Cloud Functions"></p>

<p>Chrome DevTools has a code coverage tool tracks which parts of the code actually run on the current page. This can help identify code that doesn't have to be loaded.</p>
<p>The Cloud Functions page runs 53% of the JavaScript code it downloads. This is actually a bit disappointing, as it means that even if only necessary code is loaded it would still only cut the total JavaScript size of the page in half.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-coverage.png" alt="Chrome DevTools Code Coverage tool"></p>
<h2 id="moving-configuration-into-json">Moving configuration into JSON</h2>
<p>A good amount of the code actually consists of configuration objects. For example, this 200 KB object with 4997 keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/configuration.png" alt="Configuration object in a JavaScript bundle"></p>
<p>Loading this as a JSON string with <code>JSON.parse</code> could be faster, as JSON is simpler to parse than a JavaScript object. This would be easy to do, but might not result in a huge performance improvement.</p>
<p>Ideally the app wouldn't need to load the full list on the client, but this would be harder to implement.</p>
<h2 id="reduce-code-duplication">Reduce code duplication</h2>
<p>The 200KB JSON object above is actually included in two of the JavaScript bundles. Breaking it out and reusing it would save download and processing time.</p>
<p>The same seems to apply to a bunch of UI components, like this one.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/code-duplication.png" alt="Duplicate code in DevTools code search"></p>
<h2 id="prioritize-primary-content">Prioritize primary content</h2>
<p>The Google Cloud page loads a large initial JavaScript bundle. The longer it takes to load and initialize this code, the longer it takes to load page-specific code and to render the list of Cloud Functions the user wants to see.</p>
<p>But the initial bundle also contains secondary content, like the complex navigation sidebar. This menu becomes functional before the main page content is loaded, but it should only be loaded after the primary content.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/prioritize-primary-content.png" alt="Sidebar menu is open while main content is still loading"></p>
<p>Google Cloud already does this in some cases. For example, the page initially renders a simpler version of the header and then loads more complex features later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/slow-google-cloud-ui/header.png" alt="Header doesn't show project dropdown at first and then shows it later"></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While the performance of static pages tends to be dominated by render-blocking network requests, single-page apps are often blocked by JavaScript execution or loading account data.</p>
<p>Downloading large amounts of code can hurt performance on slow connections, but due to compression and caching CPU processing often has a greater impact.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You need to have <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> installed for your OS.</li>
  <li>You need to have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a> installed for your OS.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>

<h4 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h4>

<p>Wikipedia defines Docker as</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>is a set of the platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Docker helps you in deploying your applications more efficiently in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Mac. The main advantage of docker is that it allows you to package software with all of its dependencies into a single standardized unit.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-container">What is a Container?</h4>

<p>The container is a solution for how to get the software to run without any problems when moved from one computing environment to another. This could be from a staging environment into production or maybe from a laptop to a different laptop with another operating system.</p>

<h4 id="why-use-containers">Why use containers?</h4>

<p>Containers provide a logical packaging mechanism in which your applications can be abstracted from the environment in which they run. The major difference is that every container does not require its full-fledged OS. All containers on a single host sharing a single OS. This helps in frees up huge amounts of system resources such as CPU, RAM.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<h4 id="setting-up-your-machine">Setting up your machine</h4>

<p>Once you are done installing Docker, test your Docker installation by running the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker.
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="writing-your-first-dockerfile">Writing your first Dockerfile</h4>

<ol>
  <li>A <code>Dockerfile</code> is a text document that contains all the commands you could call on the command line to make an image. Create a file <code>hello.js</code> and copy this code into it. Here we wrote a simple JS code to show Hello World on <code>localhost:8888</code>.</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code>var http <span>=</span> require<span>(</span><span>"http"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

http.createServer<span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span>request, response<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
   response.writeHead<span>(</span>200, <span>{</span><span>'Content-Type'</span>: <span>'text/plain'</span><span>})</span><span>;</span>
   response.end<span>(</span><span>'Hello World\n'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>})</span>.listen<span>(</span>8888<span>)</span><span>;</span>

// Console will print the message
console.log<span>(</span><span>'Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8888/'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ol>
  <li>Create a file named <code>Dockerfile</code> and copy this code into it.</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code>FROM node:8 

LABEL <span>maintainer</span><span>=</span><span>"championshuttler@gmail.com"</span>

RUN npm <span>install

</span>ADD hello.js /hello.js

EXPOSE 8888

ENTRYPOINT <span>[</span> <span>"node"</span>, <span>"hello.js"</span> <span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Even if this is the first Dockerfile you’ve ever seen, I’d say you could have a good guess what’s happening here. The Dockerfile instructions are FROM, ENV, LABEL, RUN , ADD , EXPOSE, and ENTRYPOINT; they’re in capitals but that’s a convention, not a requirement.</p>

<p>At a high-level, this Dockerfile gives instructions like Start with the node image, add <code>“championshuttler@gmail.com”</code> as the maintainer, run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies, copy the file in the application code, document the app’s network port, and set hello.js as the default application to run.</p>

<h4 id="building-your-docker-images">Building your Docker Images</h4>

<p>Now we will create a docker image in our local machine. Open your terminal in the current project’s folder and run</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker build <span>-t</span> helloworld <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here you’re telling Docker to build an image called <code>helloworld</code> based on the contents of the current directory (note the <strong>dot (.)</strong> at the end of the build command). Docker will look for the Dockerfile in the directory and build the image based on the instructions in the file.</p>

<h4 id="running-the-docker-image">Running the docker image</h4>

<p>After building the docker image, the next step would be to run the image and see if it works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run <span>-p</span> 8888:8888 helloworld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The command we just ran used port 8888 for the server inside the container and exposed this externally on port 8888. Head over to the URL with port 8888:</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://championshuttler.github.io/docker-basicLearning/local_resources/locahost.jpg">
</p>

<p>Congrats! You have successfully created your first docker image.</p>

<h4 id="understanding-docker-images-and-image-layers">Understanding Docker images and image layers</h4>

<p>Docker images are like virtual machine templates and are used to start containers. Under the hood, they are made up of one or more read-only layers, that when stacked together, make up the overall image. Docker takes care of stacking these layers and representing them as a single unified object. <strong>Note:</strong> Docker Images are immutable means Docker images can’t ever change. Once you’ve made one, you can delete it, but you can’t modify it.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://championshuttler.github.io/docker-basicLearning/local_resources/dockerimage.jpg">
</p>

<p>The Docker image contains all the files you packaged, which become the container’s filesystem - and it also contains a lot of metadata about the image itself. That includes a brief history of how the image was built. You can use that to see each layer of the image, and the command that built the layer. You can check the history of <code>helloworld</code> image by using:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker image <span>history </span>helloworld                                                                         
IMAGE               CREATED             CREATED BY                                      COMMENT
cb84eb33ca20        58 seconds ago      /bin/sh <span>-c</span> <span>#(nop)  ENTRYPOINT ["node" "hello…  </span>
7d652a817a9f        58 seconds ago      /bin/sh <span>-c</span> <span>#(nop)  EXPOSE 8888              </span>
334575e947c9        59 seconds ago      /bin/sh <span>-c</span> <span>#(nop) ADD file:b9606ef53b832e66e…   </span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>CREATED BY</code> commands are the Dockerfile instructions – there’s a one-to-one relationship, so each line in the Dockerfile creates an image layer.</p>

<h4 id="pushing-your-images-to-docker-hub">Pushing your images to Docker Hub</h4>

<p>First, you need to log in with your <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">dockerhub</a> account by</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker login <span>--username</span> <span>$dockerId</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that you’re logged in, you can push images to your account or to any organizations you have access to. If you’re not a member of any organization, then you can only push images to repositories in your account.</p>

<p>We built a Docker image called <code>helloworld</code>. That image reference doesn’t have an account name, so we can’t push it to any registries. We don’t need to rebuild the image to give it a new reference though, images can have several references. Tag your image by like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker image tag helloworld <span>$dockerId</span>/helloworld:v1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have an image reference with our Docker ID in the account name, and we logged in to Docker Hub so we ready to share our image! The docker image push command is the counterpart of the pull command, it uploads our local image layers to the registry:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker image push championshuttler/helloworld:v1                                           

The push refers to a repository <span>[</span>docker.io/championshuttler/helloworld]
9519a21ac374: Pushed
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="using-image-tags-effectively">Using image tags effectively</h4>

<p>We can put any string into a Docker image tag, and as we’ve already seen you can have multiple tags for the same image. We’ll use that to version the software in our images and let users make informed choices for what they won’t use - and to make our own informed choices when we use other people’s images.</p>

<p>Many software projects use a numeric versioning scheme with decimal points to indicate how big a change there is between versions, and you can follow that with your image tags. The basic idea is something like [major].[minor].[patch], which has some implicit guarantees. A release that only increments the patch number might have bugfixes but should have the same features as the last version; a release which increments the minor version might add features but shouldn’t remove any; a major release could have completely different features.</p>

<h2 id="deploying-multi-container-apps-with-docker-compose">Deploying Multi Container Apps with Docker Compose</h2>

<h4 id="what-is-docker-compose">What is Docker Compose</h4>

<p>Most applications don’t run in one single component. Even large old apps are typically built as front-end and back-end components, which are separate logical layers running in physically distributed components. Docker is ideally suited to running distributed applications - from n-tier monoliths to modern microservices. Each component runs in its lightweight container, and Docker plugs them together using standard network protocols. You define and manage multi-container apps like this using Docker Compose. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a <code>YAML</code> file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, we create and start all the services from your configuration.</p>

<p>Docker Compose file describes the desired state of your app - what it should look like when everything’s running. It’s a simple file format where you capture all the options you would put in your docker container run commands into the Compose file. Then you use the Docker Compose tool to run the app. It works out what Docker resources it needs - which could be containers, networks, or volumes - and sends requests to the Docker API to create them. The default name for the Compose YAML file is <code>docker-compose.yml</code>. However, we can use the <strong>-f</strong> flag to specify custom filenames.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<p>Below the code shows a very simple <code>Docker Compose</code> file that defines a small Flask app with two services (web-frontend and redis). The …</p></div></div>

<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>

    <span>destructor</span> <span>tp_finalize</span><span>;</span>
    <span>vectorcallfunc</span> <span>tp_vectorcall</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

December 9, 2020 | https://infinitedevices.de/en/scalable-timeseries-with-infinimesh-and-or-timeseries-plugin/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://infinitedevices.de/en/scalable-timeseries-with-infinimesh-and-or-timeseries-plugin/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Our infinimesh® platform is built to make data privacy and data ownership possible, without any doubt. To achieve this, we have built our platform in a cloud-native way and entirely API driven. It allows our customers to integrate our cloud into their systems without compromising IT Security or even move to a public cloud provider. We understand ourselves as a stretched workbench for any IoT related ideas our customers might have.</p>
<p>This blog post shows how easily infinimesh extends to an ultra-scalable time series, designed for high throughput and rapid prototyping, using the time series plugin from our GitHub space. Note that we use here Redis in the standalone mode. We urgently advise you to set up a Redis cluster if you want to run the plugin in production!</p>
<p>The plugin comes as a ready-to-ship docker container, including <a href="https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redislab TimeSeries</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a> to enable easy PoC and Hackathons.</p>
<p>To get it running, you need to have either a working docker environment or Kubernetes (likemicrok8s) installed. Of course, any cloud provider works, too. That is the beauty of cloud-native development.</p>
<p>Let’s get started:<br>
1. Check out the plugin repository:</p>
<pre><em>a. git clone <a href="https://github.com/InfiniteDevices/plugins.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/InfiniteDevices/plugins.git</a></em></pre>
<p>2. edit the docker-compose.yaml in <strong>timeseries</strong>:</p>
<pre><em>USERNAME = YOUR INFINIMESH User</em>
<em>PASSWORD = YOUR INFINIMESH Password</em>
<em>API_URL = FQDN-API-Endpoint (ex: <a href="https://api.infinimesh.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://api.infinimesh.cloud</a>)</em></pre>
<p>3. Then run everything via:</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose -f timeseries/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --build</code></pre>
<p>After a few seconds, the connector and the time series backend are available, and infinimesh pushes data into:</p>

<p>4. After some time, Grafana will be ready. Connect your browser tohttp://localhost:3000and follow the instructions to change the default admin credentials (admin/admin). Please note that the setup disappears when the docker container gets deleted.</p>

<p>The memory and CPU footprint shows that the plugin, which we used for this blog post, does not consume too many resources:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD2.png" alt="" width="977" height="562" srcset="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD2.png 977w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD2-300x173.png 300w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD2-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"></p>


<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>We have built a sample dashboard that can be easily imported. The sample dashboard shows all captured data in one graph. Feel free to use this as a starting point to create your powerful dashboards.</p>

<h3>Add the Redis data source</h3>
<p><strong>Note: We provision in the newest container (build 77c68e4) redis as default data source – this step is not necessary anymore.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When you login into Grafana the first time using an image prior to build 77c68e4, you have to add the data source by clicking:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD3.png" alt="" width="389" height="364" srcset="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD3.png 389w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD3-300x281.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px"></p>

<p>Type “redis” into the search field:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD4.png" alt="" width="977" height="195" srcset="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD4.png 977w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD4-300x60.png 300w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD4-768x153.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"></p>

<p>and select this data source by clicking into it. The following shows the setup, just put <strong>redis://redis:6379</strong> into the address field and click “<strong>save and test</strong>“:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD5.png" alt="" width="977" height="1050" srcset="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD5.png 977w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD5-279x300.png 279w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD5-953x1024.png 953w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD5-768x825.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"></p>
<p>Now Grafana can talk to the Redis time-series backend. You can now import the dashboard by Create -&gt; Import -&gt; Upload JSON File and select sample-dashboard.json from the directory in which you have synced the repository. You should now see the Dashboard:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD6.png" alt="" width="977" height="281" srcset="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD6.png 977w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD6-300x86.png 300w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD6-768x221.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"></p>

<p>All data we captured from the very beginning are displayed there. You can now start to explore Grafana and build awesome dashboards. With this approach, we also enable our customers to excel in rapid prototyping using infinimesh technology.</p>
<p>For example, here we selected some data points (pressing Ctrl + select the data point) to get fast insight into the data (this is the SMA solar plant):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD7.png" alt="" width="977" height="325" srcset="https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD7.png 977w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD7-300x100.png 300w, https://infinitedevices.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BILD7-768x255.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px"></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>16 Aug 2020 • 5 min read</p><p>Have you been struggling to study effectively? Sometimes it seems as if we have more pages to read than time on the clock. However, if you decide to study smart instead of studying hard, you are more likely to get the outcome that you desire. In this article, you will be given strategies on how to study effectively.</p><picture><source media="(min-width: 1100px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-920.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 1099px) and (min-width: 421px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-640.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-1280.jpg 2x"><source media="(max-width: 420px)" srcset="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-420.jpg, https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying-840.jpg 2x"><img src="https://productive.fish/blog/how-to-study-effectively/studying.jpg" alt="Illustration of studying person"></picture><h2 id="organize-your-learning-process">Organize your learning process</h2><p>Organizing your entire learning process is the very first step that you need to take in studying more effectively. You will need to assign a particular place in your home where you get your studying done, determine a schedule that guides your study time, and you will need to decide whether or not you will be studying in a group or by yourself. You will also need to determine what study style is best for you. Having this in place helps you to approach your studying in a more systematic and efficient manner.</p><p>Let’s take a look at approaches that can help you to better understand how to learn effectively.</p><h3 id="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</h3><p><a href="https://productive.fish/blog/spaced-repetition">Spaced repetition</a> refers to the practice of allowing space between each study session. By integrating time intervals in your study schedule, you will be able to retain more even if you spend less time studying.</p><p>This works by tapping into the potential of what is called the spacing effect. This speaks to the fact that our brain is better able to learn new concepts by using intervals between exposure to the information.</p><p>How to study more effectively with this method? Let’s say you have an exam scheduled for next week. You should have a study session today. Your next study session would be two days from today. You should then have a final study session the day before the test.</p><h3 id="active-recall">Active recall</h3><p>Another way to learn effectively is to employ the principles of active recall. This approach has been found to be the most effective, efficient, and quickest way to study materials. This approach holds that in order to get the best out of studying, you need to actively stimulate your memory. This moves students from a passive approach to studying such as simply reading silently to an approach where the student interacts with the material.</p><p>This includes asking and answering questions about the material read and many other tactics. You will find that there are a number of different ways to implement active recall. Two popular methods of active learning are the Read-Recite-Review (3R) method and the Feynman Technique.</p><h3 id="pomodoro-technique-and-the-importance-of-study-breaks">Pomodoro Technique and the Importance of Study Breaks</h3><p>The struggle we all have with procrastination is real and should not be overlooked. One of the best strategies for minimizing distractions is the <a href="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro technique</a>. This approach helps to keep you from becoming overwhelmed by studying and from burnouts. It includes stipulated work intervals and breaks.</p><p>An example of studying effectively with the Pomodoro technique is as follows:</p><ul><li>Study for 25 minutes</li><li>Distractions will come. When they do, write them down on a piece of paper.</li><li>At the end of the 25-minute period, place a check mark on your paper.</li><li>Break from studying for 5 minutes.</li><li>After doing this 4 times, take a 30-minute break.</li><li>Repeat the entire process.</li></ul><p>This method was developed by Francesco Cirillo. This time management technique was inspired by the popular tomato-shaped kitchen timer.</p><p>Breaks are critical to learning effectively. These breaks help to maintain performance while studying, reduce the stress associated with studying, increase focus, and help with memory retention.</p><h3 id="bite-sized-learning">Bite-sized learning</h3><p>Another method to consider when trying to uncover how to study better is bite-sized learning. This method means just what the name suggests – studying information in small bits or spending very short periods studying at a time.</p><p>With the constant reduction of attention span among humans in the 21st century, it is becoming more and more important that you spend 1-15 minutes at a time on any given learning objective. The focus that you will have in this short period of time makes learning more effective.</p><h2 id="take-notes-the-right-way">Take notes the right way</h2><p>There are many powerful reasons that all students should actively take notes in class and while studying. These reasons include:</p><p>Taking notes is helpful in keeping your mind alert. By actively writing notes, you are interacting with the information. This helps to reduce drowsiness and prevents distractions. The act of deciphering what information to jot down helps to keep your mind engaged in what you are reading or listening to. Taking notes gives you an opportunity to highlight or emphasize certain bits of information. It also helps with the organization of said information. The highlighted and organized information that you take during class or in a study session helps to make your future study sessions or review of class information much more effective. Taking good notes in class or during a study session provides you with an abbreviated yet potent set of information for effective studying. When it becomes necessary to study for an exam or a test, you can easily draw on your notes and spend less time reinforcing the most important points.</p><p>Let’s look at some note-taking techniques to help you effectively study.</p><h3 id="the-cornell-note-taking-system">The Cornell Note Taking System</h3><p>This system of note-taking was developed by Walter Pauk in the 1940s. This approach to notetaking is systematic and more condensed. It can be used by high school students or students at the college level.</p><p>This method entails a student dividing a page into three sections. A keyword section, the notes section, and a section for a summary of the lesson. In this method, long sentences are avoided while taking notes to reduce the bulk. The keyword section only features words or questions that are most important , which students can easily reflect on when reviewing their notes.</p><h3 id="the-outlining-method">The Outlining Method</h3><p>This method is ideal for you when your are trying to discover how to study more effectively. It includes creating an outline of the course, article or a book. In this method, information is summarized in brief bullet points. The major points are at farthest to the left while minor points are indented.</p><h3 id="the-mapping-method">The Mapping Method</h3><p>The mapping method involves the use of a graphic representation of that which is being studied. It shows how the various pieces of information to be absorbed relates to each other. The <a href="https://productive.fish/blog/mind-mapping-software">mind mapping method</a> can be coupled with the outline method or the Cornell note-taking system quite effectively.</p><h2 id="teach-someone-else">Teach someone else</h2><p>It is always said that the best way to better learn a subject is to teach it to someone else. One of the most effective ways to retain information is to share it with others. You could develop a habit of mentoring students in your class who are having a hard time grasping the concepts being taught.</p><p>Another creative way to deepen your understanding of a subject by teaching others is by starting a blog series on the topic that you are studying. You will be able to edify others while being better prepared to succeed in your next exam.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Learning to study more effectively is a critical part of student success. While all of these methods have been proven to be effective, everybody learns differently; therefore, it is best for you to try each of these methods to see which is most effective for you. Fight the temptation to be lazy in this process. By finding the approach that is best for you, your entire academic life can become much smoother.</p></article></div>]]>

You’ll see our IPU-M2000 system significantly outperforms the Nvidia A100 DGX across the board, with orders of magnitude performance improvements for some models.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Graphcore customers are already making big leaps forward with our second generation IPU systems – whether they prioritise faster time to result, model accuracy, better efficiency, lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) or the chance to make new breakthroughs in AI with the IPU.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen a range of the most popular models our customers frequently turn to as proxies for their proprietary production AI workloads in natural language processing, computer vision and more, both in training and inference.</p>
<p>We are also delighted to share results in this blog using our new PyTorch framework support. We are continuing to develop and expand this capability – you can find out more in our blog <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu"><span>here</span></a>. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The results are measured on IPU-M2000 &amp; IPU-POD<sub>64</sub> platforms. Wherever possible, we compare IPU performance against performance numbers published by NVIDIA for the A100 GPU as part of the DGX A100 platform. It’s notoriously hard to find an exact apples-to-apples comparison for very different products and chip architectures, so we compare against the closest platform in terms of price and power. Where NVIDIA has not published results for a particular model, measured results are used.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Code for all of our benchmarks is available from the examples repo on the <a href="https://github.com/graphcore"><span>Graphcore GitHub</span></a> site where you can also find code for many other model types and application examples.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We’ve included notes for each chart to explain our methodology and to provide additional information about batch sizes, data sets, floating point arithmetic, frameworks etc. In addition to publishing our benchmarking charts in this blog and on our <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/benchmarks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, we are also publishing performance data in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/performance-results" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tabular format </a>for IPU-M2000 and IPU-POD systems on our website. We’ll add more and update the results regularly.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve also joined <a href="https://mlcommons.org/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MLCommons</a>, the governing body for the independent benchmarking organisation, MLPerf. We will be participating in MLPerf in 2021 – starting with the first training submission in the Spring – as well as continuing to build out our own performance results.</p>
<p><strong><span>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>BERT-Large Training</strong></p>
<p>BERT-Large <span>(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</span> is established as one of the most widely used models for NLP.</p>
<p>The IPU-POD<sub>64 </sub>is over 5x faster than a DGX A100 system for end-to-end BERT-Large Training to convergence to reference accuracies. To provide consistency in the comparisons used in our other charts, we also show time-to-train for a 2x DGX A100 system.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>BERT-Large Inference</strong></p>
<p>The goal in inference production systems is typically to achieve the highest possible throughput at the lowest possible latency. For example, search engine companies and many automated services using inference need to respond in near real time.</p>
<p>For BERT-Large Inference, the IPU-M2000 delivers 3.4x higher throughput at the lowest latency compared to the A100.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Vision&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ResNet-50 Training</strong></p>
<p>The IPU-M2000 processes 2.6x more images per second vs the A100 for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385"><span>ResNet-50</span></a>, a common model for image classification used as a baseline performance metric across the industry, which has been highly optimised on GPU architectures.

<p><strong>ResNet-50 Inference</strong></p>
<p>The IPU-M2000 delivers 4.6x higher throughput at lowest latency comparing with published results for the A100 80GB GPU, for both PyTorch and TensorFlow, achieving much higher absolute throughput of 58,112 images per second.</p>

<p><strong>EfficientNet Training</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946">EfficientNet</a></span> uses innovative techniques like group separable and depth-wise convolutions to deliver far higher accuracy per parameter than legacy image classification models like ResNet-50.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Group and depth-wise convolutions use smaller kernels which are not well suited to GPUs and this has limited their adoption to date.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>By contrast, a fine-grained processor like the IPU, with its unique MIMD architecture, is much better suited to group convolution, depth-wise convolution and more generally sparse models which inherently do not use dense, contiguous data structures.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For standard EfficientNet-B4 Training for both PyTorch and TensorFlow, the IPU-M2000 achieves 10x throughput advantage versus the latest GPU.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Probabilistic Learning</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Probabilistic models are used in applications where the underlying system is inherently stochastic. They are widely used in the financial sector and as well as in scientific research. However, many varieties of probabilistic models do not fit well with the SIMD/SIMT architecture of GPUs and run far too slowly to be of use. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Training</strong></p>
<p>Using an off-the-shelf TensorFlow Probability (TFP) library to assess the performance of probabilistic models on IPU, we see that a financial MCMC workload trains in less than 3 hours on the IPU-M2000 platform, 17x faster than the 48 hours measured on the latest GPU.</p>

<p><strong>Speech Processing</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Converting written text into speech is a challenging but highly valuable area of speech technology research, with a wide variety of use-cases across most industry verticals.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A number of text-to-speech models have risen to prominence, including Tacotron from Google, Deep Voice from Baidu and FastSpeech from Microsoft, enabling high-quality, end-to-end speech synthesis.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Voice 3 Training</strong></p>
<p>Here we focus on the third Deep Voice iteration. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07654"><span>Deep Voice 3</span></a> model is fully convolutional and uses attention blocks to decode the input text sequence to the output audio sequence representation. More details about our Deep Voice 3 implementation are provided in the <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/accelerating-text-to-speech-models-with-the-ipu"><span>Accelerating Text-To-Speech models with the IPU</span></a> blog.</p>
<p>The chart below highlights the performance advantage of the IPU-M2000 on the Deep Voice 3 model, with over 13x higher throughput versus the latest GPU.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=2000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg" alt="Deep Voice 3_December 2020" width="2000" srcset="https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=1000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 1000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=2000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 2000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=3000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 3000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=4000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 4000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=5000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 5000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=6000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 6000w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span><strong>Time Series Analysis</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Time series forecasting models can predict future values based on previous, sequential data. LSTM is one of the most widely used time series analysis models. Financial companies in particular rely on LSTMs for modelling and predicting financial data such as stock prices. The use of LSTM-based methods in the finance industry is highlighted in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06848.pdf"><span>arxiv paper</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>LSTM Inference</strong></p>
<p>The chart below compares throughput vs latency across a range of batch sizes for the IPU-M2000 vs the latest GPU for an LSTM 2-Layer Inference model. Across a range of batch sizes the performance advantage is apparent. At the lowest latency achievable by the GPU, the IPU-M2000 is capable of achieving 600x higher throughput at a lower latency.</p>

<p><strong>Future Breakthroughs with the IPU</strong></p>
<p>As we have seen, the IPU delivers state of the art performance on established image processing and language models such as ResNet and BERT.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It is also clear that the IPU can deliver huge performance gains in several new or currently under-utilised model types which are indicative of the future trend in machine intelligence, like EfficientNet, ResNeXt and MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) probability-based methods.</p>
<p>We are also working on some exciting developments with sparse models, and are introducing a preview version of our generalized sparse library support in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poplar SDK 1.4</a>, which was released today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine intelligence innovation is still in the early stages and we expect to see many new innovations developed over the next few years. The IPU has been designed to help innovators create these new breakthroughs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reddit is an excellent place for two things:</p><p><strong>1 - Getting a massive amount of traffic from a viral post</strong></p><p>It requires many things to happen. The perfect post with the perfect title on the perfect subreddit and a bit of luck. That's hard to do, and even people who have done it before can't do it again. It's not easy.</p><p><strong>2 - Getting your first customers/subscribers and validate your ideas</strong></p><p>This is for everyone. You don't need any luck. Just to know a little bit about Reddit and find the best approach to follow.</p><p>For the last couple of months, I've spent hours analyzing what works and what doesn't on Reddit—trying to understand the magic behind promoting while adding value to the platform.</p><p>Today I want to tell you how I applied the second approach to validate an idea and how I doubled my email subscribers so you can do the same.</p><p><strong>Some Context</strong></p><p>I started a newsletter 15 days ago. The newsletter is about my path to freedom. My learnings, what works, and what doesn’t work. Having freedom includes money, an important piece, a good lifestyle, traveling, cooking, reading, writing, drinking good coffee, etc.</p><p>So as a part of my newsletter, I wanted to have something fun to do and share and wrote this:</p><p><a href="https://jrleonr.com/p/52-challenges-for-2021">52 Tiny Challenges to Try Something New Every Week in 2021</a></p><p>The purpose is to include every week one thing that I will explore and share with my subscribers on the newsletter to try it together.</p><p>Things like: Meditation for one hour during a week, not drinking coffee for an entire week(this is something I definitely do not want to do…), or walk 20K steps every day for 7 days.</p><p>I want to do it because I want to improve and try new things. Maybe something feels amazing, and I can add it to my daily routines.</p><p>But I also wanted to have something concrete to share on Reddit.</p><p>If instead of this, I try to share something like: Join my newsletter… that’d be spam. It doesn’t offer anything.</p><p>Sharing a link without any context, benefit, or value for the reader will never work.</p><p>So once I had the short article written, I entered Reddit and shared it inside a post, like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae888c27-0ba2-40e5-af5d-b76f5c0b5524_1460x772.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae888c27-0ba2-40e5-af5d-b76f5c0b5524_1460x772.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae888c27-0ba2-40e5-af5d-b76f5c0b5524_1460x772.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:770,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:145458,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I created 4 more posts, but I didn't publish them at the same time. I did it slowly, with a couple of days of difference between them, and I changed the title and the copy a bit. </p><p>These are the list of the subreddits where I posted:</p><p>r/Habits | 31 Upvotes  - 2 comments</p><p>r/IWantToLearn | 13 Upvotes - 9 comments</p><p>r/WriterMotivation | 21 Upvotes - 0 comments</p><p>r/InternetIsBeautiful |  11 Upvotes  - 0 comments (the post was removed)</p><p>r/getdisciplined | 3 Upvotes - 2 comments</p><h2>Results</h2><p>The post wasn’t valuable enough to get a massive result. I just did a quick test to check what people have to say. You don’t need a perfect plan to test if something will work. Do something small, test, and think about what to do next. Feedback helps.</p><p><strong>Numbers from the post</strong></p><p>These are the views and subscribers from people who visited the article. Many many people subscribed, considering that it had only 588 views. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa056580a-1070-4c6f-ba89-c5aee16cec2f_940x498.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa056580a-1070-4c6f-ba89-c5aee16cec2f_940x498.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a056580a-1070-4c6f-ba89-c5aee16cec2f_940x498.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:940,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:42609,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><h3>Subscribers</h3><p>You can see the jump between the 23rd and the 27th.

<p>The Universal Basic Education (UBE) Programme was introduced in Nigeria in September 1988. Following this, in 2008 the Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) developed and introduced the 9-Year Basic Education Curriculum (BEC) in schools by realigning all extant Primary and Junior Secondary School Curricula to meet the key targets of the UBE program. Given some contemporary and national concerns and to make the curriculum more practical, relevant, interest generating to the young learners and in line with global best practices, the 9-year BEC was recently revised in 2012 and its implementation has just commenced in September 2014. This article is focused on the structure, special features, and the implementation strategy of the Revised 9-Year Basic Education Curriculum with some emphasis on the Basic Science and Technology component as one of the key cluster subjects prepared with the aim of catching the young learner to love science, learn science and create change in the learner's environment.</p>

And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. <strong>The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around.</strong> Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to make Asynchronous APIs as successful and mature as REST APIs.</strong> We are aware this is a long journey but, with Postman's help, we'll be able to grow the team and continue working on the AsyncAPI specification and all the necessary tools to create a delightful developer experience. The AsyncAPI Initiative team is fully committed to open source software (OSS), and the partnership with Postman will help us keep doing our job with freedom and independence.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>We want to make the AsyncAPI Initiative a neutral and independent place for collaborating on defining the future of Asynchronous APIs. Next step for us is to host the project in a neutral foundation to guarantee the long-term success of the initiative. We're currently in conversations with different actors of the OSS world to make sure the initiative remains independent.</p><p>Also, we want you to work with us. <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/jobs">We are hiring</a> at Postman to work full-time on AsyncAPI. In the first half of 2021, we'll open a bunch of positions, including Software Engineers, Graphic Designers, Technical Writers, and more.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>He couldn't believe it. This certainly couldn't be true. Someone else must have made a mistake here. He read the email a second time. Maybe he missed something and the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding? But he didn't, of course. He is the kind of person who always pays attention to typos, therefore reading it again was quite pointless. Anger started spreading through him. How dare they? It felt so incredibly stupid and unfair. Especially considering he was such a law-abiding citizen. He despised those who didn't follow rules. They couldn't possibly mean that he was one of them? Yet this is exactly what the email was saying: "We can inform you that you unfortunately have used the wrong licence plate in the app, which is why you have been given a fine. In this case the fine is issued on <strong>AB12345</strong>, while parking was activated for <strong>AB1234</strong> in the app.". Filled with rage, he locked his phone and shoved it back into his pocket. He missed one bloody number!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Validation to the Rescue</h2>
<p>In Norway, license plates for cars follow a certain pattern: they consist of two letters and five digits (there are some exceptions, such as personal license plates). Considering this, we realize that the above scenario could have been avoided merely by adding some form validation! For this, we will utilize <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Form</a>, which has become quite popular over the last year. React Hook Form is easy to use, quite lightweight and very performant. It has built-in validation, but also supports schema-based form validation with other tools such as <a href="https://github.com/jquense/yup">Yup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/superstruct">Superstruct</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sideway/joi">Joi</a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume we have this very basic skeleton for a parking app:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> e<span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>onFormSubmit<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The app contains a form with a text input and a button. We also added an <code>onSubmit</code> method that prevents the form from being submitted and the page from being refreshed. Apart from that, the app doesn't really do anything meaningful. Let's add some validation:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> handleSubmit<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>data<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onFormSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> ref<span>=</span><span>{</span>register<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we don't need to add much code to set up React Hook Form. We have to call the <code>useForm</code> hook which returns a bunch of methods. For the time being, we simply use <code>handleSubmit</code> and <code>register</code>. We then wrap the <code>onFormSubmit</code> method into the <code>handleSubmit</code> method. This will take care of only invoking <code>onFormSubmit</code> and pass the form data when all fields are valid (it also prevents the form from submitting, so we don't need to explicitly call the <code>preventDefault</code> method). Finally, we need to set the <code>register</code> method as the input field's ref attribute. But this is not the end of the story! The form allows any input, even if it is left empty. This is why we have to specify some validation rules:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>input 
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> 
  placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> 
  ref<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    required<span>:</span> <span>"You must enter a license number."</span><span>,</span>
    pattern<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      value<span>:</span> <span>/^[a-z]{2}\d{5}$/i</span><span>,</span>
      message<span>:</span> <span>"The license number must be a combination of two letters and five digits."</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When registering the input field, we can add several options to adjust how the field should be validated. In the above example, we tell our form that the field is required and that the value must match a specific regex pattern. We also define some error messages. If we try to submit the form, but validation fails, the error message is returned by <code>useForm</code> as an object called <code>errors</code>. Every form field gets its own error message corresponding to the field's <code>name</code> attribute:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>{</span>errors<span>.</span>licenseNo <span>&amp;&amp;</span> errors<span>.</span>licenseNo<span>.</span>message<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, we can use a simple component, <code>ErrorMessage</code> (we must first install a separate NPM package):</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>ErrorMessage
  errors<span>=</span><span>{</span>errors<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all we need to avoid registering an invalid license number! However, there are some more concepts we should have a look at.</p>
<h2>Controlled vs. Uncontrolled</h2>
<p>React Hook Form is designed to work best with <em>uncontrolled components</em>. This means that form data is handled by the DOM itself and can be accessed directly using refs (which is why we put the <code>register</code> method there). <em>Controlled components</em> on the other hand, use event handlers such as <code>onChange</code> to update values at state change. Many third-party libraries use controlled components, and luckily there is a way we can use those together with React Hook Form:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  <span>as</span><span>=</span><span>{</span>ReactSelect<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span><span>}</span>
  isClearable
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We add a <a href="https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select">React Select</a> for choosing the cars fuel type by wrapping it inside a <code>Controller</code> component using the <code>as</code> prop. The Controller automatically injects the <code>onChange</code>, <code>onBlur</code> and <code>value</code> props into the wrapped component. The same applies to other props that may be required by the underlying component (in this case the props <code>options</code> and <code>isClearable</code>). Validation rules are applied by setting the <code>rules</code> prop. Although this is the preferred syntax, you sometimes need to use the <code>render</code> prop instead of the <code>as</code> prop, which lets you customize events, value and ref:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  render<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onChange<span>,</span> onBlur<span>,</span> value<span>,</span> ref <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>ReactSelect
      options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span><span>}</span>
      onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span>
      onBlur<span>=</span><span>{</span>onBlur<span>}</span>
      inputValue<span>=</span><span>{</span>value<span>?.</span>key<span>}</span>
      inputRef<span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span>
    <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Form Context</h2>
<p>When moving input fields to shared components in order to make them reusable, you can of course pass all neccessary methods from <code>useForm</code> as props. In many cases, it would be a more elegant solution to put the whole form into a <code>FormProvider</code> and access the context of the form with <code>useformContext</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> methods <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>FormProvider <span>{</span><span>...</span>methods<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>methods<span>.</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>LicenseNoInput <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>FormProvider<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>LicenseNoInput</code> component can then access the form methods as simple as this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> errors<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useFormContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's pack it all up, add a little more logic and styling and voilà – we have a parking app with form validation that actually works!</p>

<h2>Like a Swiss Army Knife</h2>
<p>There is so much more you can do with React Hook Form! It's too bad I can't cover it all in a single article. I can recommend a look at the <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/api/">official documentation</a>, which also provides many useful examples. Personally, I have been using this tool for about a year now and have never been in a situation where it couldn't solve a problem. If you are still not convinced, the fact that TypeScript is fully supported will hopefully change your mind.</p></section></article></div>]]>

We talked about Why you should blog, what are the prerequisites, how to start blogging, choosing the topics, and structuring your blog for better readability, etc.</p>
<p>This blog is a supplementary read and conveys the teaching of the same talk. This is going to be a detailed guide on all of your concerns about blogging. Let's start with one question that every person starting a blog has in mind "Should I blog?".</p>
<p><a href="#talk-video">CLICK HERE TO JUMP TO TALK VIDEO 👈</a></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="should-i-blog">Should I Blog</h2>
<p>We often underestimate ourselves and think if we are really good enough to start blogging. <strong>Do I have enough expertise to write about a certain topic? Will people want to read what I have to say? What if I make mistakes? But I'm just a beginner?</strong></p>
<p>These are some of the concerns even I had when I wrote my first blog so you're not alone. I think what's happening here is we are trapped in some kind of imposter syndrome. <strong>We think we are not good enough or to rephrase "not experts to write about a certain topic"</strong>. But here is the secret, "Nobody else is". We are all learning, growing at our own pace and we all feel like there is a ton of stuff to learn before we start sharing our knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>I think the best time to start blogging is right when you're learning.</strong> When you are trying out something new, you're stumbling upon problems that an expert won't even know exists. So, <strong>you trying to solve your problem is an excellent reason to write about it</strong>. You will discover a problematic area more often than an expert simply because you are experiencing it yourself.</p>
<p>The other question is  <strong>do I have something new to offer?</strong> Again, this doesn't matter because we are not discovering anything new, we are learning that same topic with our perspective. And that perspective to approach is unique.</p>
<p>You can try writing about the topic you just learned with your perspective and who knows, maybe you do help someone see the things from your eyes and it makes things easier for them. So, in this sense, being a beginner is a massive plus point when you want to write.</p>
<p>You might <strong>feel not confident enough</strong> and think <strong>what if I make a mistake</strong>. I think it's okay to make mistakes as long as we can correct them or learn from them. Writing about a topic does involve a good amount of research and that will surely help you avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>Other than that, I feel very proud to say that our JS community is very welcoming when it comes to helping others. You can just <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/iamshadmirza">send me a DM</a> or any other person who you think can provide feedback. Ask nicely and they will guide you in making your article mistake-free and more presentable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a side note, we are mentoring first-time writers for this specific reason and you can enroll too. Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://thenextbigwriter.tech/">thenextbigwriter.tech</a> and join. We will help you with everything possible and yes, it's free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope I was able to give you some assurance that you can blog. But you might say, <strong>"Yeah, shad. I know I can blog but should I do it. Is it worth it?"</strong>. Let's talk more about this.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-blog">Why You Should Blog</h2>
<p>Blogging itself is an amazing exercise to build your <strong>communication skill</strong> which is very essential when it comes to code. But this is just one reason, there are many more, to begin with.</p>
<p>Say you want to write a blog titled "All about promises in JavaScript", what will you do?.</p>
<p>You will study the topic in detail, create some code snippets to explain the logic, learn what are the pros and cons of that, what are different ways to work with that, etc.</p>
<p>What I want to say is, these all things are much much more than what you would do if you're just coding promises in an app. You will get a much <strong>deeper understanding</strong> of the topic and will be pretty confident when it comes to coding promises. This is a big plus for your career as a developer.</p>
<p>Let's talk about <strong>exposure</strong>. Once you write something and share it with the community, people are going to read and think "Yeah, this guy knows this topic well". Of course, you do, thanks to all the research we just talked about. This gives you exposure. I have personally got a <strong>lot of job offers and freelancing opportunities</strong> just because the recruiter happened to be on one of my blogs. This happens all the time. Not to forget, having an active blog on your resume <strong>gives you a huge plus when it comes to interviews.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Did I mention that you can pay for writing too?</strong> Yes, there are writing programs that pay you up to <strong>$300 per article</strong>. Some folks are writing full time and earning more than what they can in a job. Let's recall what we just learned.</p>
<ol>
<li>Improves communication skill</li>
<li>Give a deeper understanding of the topic</li>
<li>Help you get exposure in the community</li>
<li>Help you in getting a job or freelance gigs</li>
<li>Provides an amazing earning opportunity as a full-time writer.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you're convinced enough to start a blog now. Let's learn how can you do that.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-start-a-blog">How To Start A Blog</h2>
<p>What will be the questions you will have in mind when starting a blog? I'm listing out a few here, please drop a question if you have anything else.</p>
<ol>
<li>What platform to choose</li>
<li>What tools to you</li>
</ol>
<p>The one thing that you should be concerned about here is SEO and content ownership. You don't want duplicate content as this will reduce your SEO ranking. <strong>You would want to own the content and brand it as your blog</strong>. The major problem with platforms like the medium is that they own the content. That's why people choose to create their blogging site using Gatsby or Ghost.</p>
<p>While these two are very decent solutions but <strong>they do require a lot of work on your side</strong>. You will have to take care of everything yourself and <strong>this might comes in way of actually writing the blog</strong>. I might be biased here but you can try Hashnode (Skip it if you're already a Hashnode user 😁). Hashnode lets you blog on your domain so you get full content ownership. Your posts get to be featured on the Hashnode feed and you get an instant audience boost. If your post performs well, it gets to be picked up and featured on <a target="_blank" href="https://daily.dev/">Daily.dev</a> too. Your SEO and all other blog-related stuff are already customized so that you can <strong>focus on actually writing instead of maintaining your blog.</strong></p>
<p>So my suggestion is to blog on your domain, you can choose between Gatsby, Ghost, or Hashnode as you like. Buying a domain will a small investment but it's worth it in the long run. Create a blog on Hashnode and add your domain.</p>
<p><strong>Now, what to write about?</strong> Choose a topic that you have recently learned or want to learn. Research that topic and write some points that you want to include in the blog. Write your blog around those bullet points. We will learn more about the structure and how to write it later in this article.</p>
<p>One important thing is to check your blog post for errors and spelling mistakes. I would suggest you use <a target="_blank" href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> for this purpose. Once you're done writing, check it with Grammarly and correct the errors. You're ready to post now 🚀.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose-topics">How To Choose Topics</h2>
<p>While there are different approaches, I can only share what has worked for me and hope it works for you too. The idea here is to <strong>Love the process</strong>. How?</p>
<ol>
<li>Find something that you wanna learn and share your learnings in form of an article.</li>
<li>Choose something that you have recently learned.</li>
<li>Write about something that you're genuinely interested in. It won't feel like a burden and you will enjoy it.</li>
<li>If you had a hard time, solving something at work, write about it.</li>
<li>Keep an eye on popular sites like freeCodeCamp and Hackernoon and see what they are writing about. Certain topics do well than others and you will start to see a pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, remember why you're writing. It should not be to become famous or bring more traffic to your site. These are side effects and will happen but they are not the actual goal here. <strong>Think about how you can provide some value to the reader. If you can nail this part, you are good to go. Solve problems and help others.</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-to-structure-your-blog">How To Structure Your Blog</h2>
<p>One of the main problems I have encountered is <strong>motivation</strong>. I always waited too long for motivation and didn't write at all. Writing a 1500 words blog post is not an easy task which puts me in procrastination mode. <strong>How to tackle this?</strong> This is the approach I follow.</p>
<h3 id="1-create-roadmap">1. Create Roadmap</h3>
<p>Write a description of your blog in 2 to 3 lines. Write bullet points for what you want to cover in the article. These points can be section of the topic you're writing or different steps a user will follow if it's a tutorial. This will serve as a roadmap for our blog. Now, when you can see the roadmap, everything else will become easy.</p>
<h3 id="2-follow-the-roadmap">2. Follow the Roadmap</h3>
<p>Expand a description and write an intro. Greet the reader and talk about what you're gonna cover and how it will benefit the reader. 2-3 lines in okay.</p>
<p>Take bullet points as headings and expand the topic into the paragraph. Do this for each point one at a time. <strong>Make sure you focus on one point only, otherwise it will start feeling overwhelming.</strong></p>
<p>Once you have covered the points, write a conclusion in a takeaway fashion. Tell the reader what he just learned. It will make the topic stick in the user's mind.</p>
<p><strong>This is the approach I follow and it works even when you're not motivated to write.</strong></p>
<p>Now let's come to best practices.</p>
<h2 id="blogging-best-practices">Blogging Best Practices</h2>
<ol>
<li>Starting is toughest, make it as easy as possible. <strong>Remember, Pushing a sliding car is much easier than pushing a car that is halted.</strong> That description and bullet-point approach will provide enough push to keep you going.</li>
<li>Create an <strong>Idea Log</strong>, collect ideas to write on. Don't discard anything even if it's very basic.</li>
<li>Write what you're gonna explain first, explain that, tell the reader what you just explained. This flow is perfect for writing blogs/tutorials that stick.</li>
<li>Don't use lengthy sentences. Use small, simple sentences that are easy to read. <strong>Try to look helpful, not smart.</strong></li>
<li>Divide the blog into small sections and guide your reader through it. The reader often skims through the content …</li></ol></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The time of binders full of invoices and other documents is over.
At least for me.</p>

<p>Almost all of my personal home office is paperless these days. However almost everything still <em>arrives</em> on paper.
This article tells you how I deal with it.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>

<p>My ultimate goal is to have as little paper documents as possible. A few things are too important to throw away, like important contracts or bank account credentials, but everything else should be stored digitally.</p>

<p>After looking at a few full blown document management solutions I switched to a very simple system: Storing the documents as PDFs in a regular folder structure.</p>

<h2 id="the-pipeline">The pipeline</h2>

<h3 id="step-one-paper-to-pdf">Step one: Paper to PDF</h3>

<p>I still get documents in paper by post.</p>

<p>So the first step is my scanner: An Epson WorkForce multi functional printer.
The document scanner within the device has the nice functionality to directly store the scanned documents in the cloud.</p>

<p>My cloud storage provider is Google Drive, so when scanning a document it is automatically uploaded to the folder <code>Inbox/Scanner/Raw</code> in my Google Drive account.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev.betterdoc.org/assets/img-posts/paperless-home-office-epson-workforce.jpg" alt="My scanner"></p>

<h3 id="step-two-optimizing-the-pdf">Step two: Optimizing the PDF</h3>

<p>The PDF generated by the Epson WorkForce isn’t really optimized yet (neither in terms of size nor in terms of content).</p>

<p>I found a nice little tool called <a href="https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF">OCRmyPDF</a> which can enhance a scanned PDF so that not only the scanned image is contained inside it but also all text from that image via OCR - a nice addition for searching within a document and also an easy way to copy textual information out of a PDF.
OCRmyPDF is also able to compress an image inside a PDF significantly, so that the resulting document not only contains the text  but in addition is only about 60% of it’s original size.</p>

<p>So I want to run all PDF documents created by the scanner through OCRmyPDF.</p>

<p>As the name suggests the <code>Raw</code> folder is only an intermediary storage location designed for exactly this purpose: Have an inbox of PDFs that still need to be optimized.
Once the optimization is complete the PDFs should be moved to the <code>Processed</code> folder.</p>

<p>The following script applies OCRmyPDF and moves the optimized PDFs from the <code>Raw</code> folder to the <code>Processed</code> folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-three-automating-the-conversion">Step three: Automating the conversion</h3>

<p>To make sure that the script is run automatically on each file that arrives in the <code>Raw</code> folder I use another little tool: <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel</a>.
Hazel runs silently in the background of my machine.
It is configured to listen to any changes made to the <code>Raw</code> directory and then invoke the script listed above for all files it detects.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev.betterdoc.org/assets/img-posts/paperless-home-office-hazel.png" alt="Hazel"></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Voila, the pipeline is complete:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The scanner reads the document and stores in into Google Drive so it’s automatically synchronized to my local machine.</li>
  <li>Hazel detects new files and calls the conversion script.</li>
  <li>The conversion script optimizes the PDF and moves it into the target folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing that is not yet automated is sorting the document into a target folder based on its content (e.g. invoices should be moved into the <code>Invoices</code> folder while documents from my health insurance should be moved into the <code>Healthinsurance</code> folder).</p>

<p>Nevertheless this eases a lot of my pain in managing my personal documents.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-mcu-sdks">I wrote about MCU SDKs</a> and how frustrating I sometimes found
it to be confronted with one Eclipse-based IDE after another. If you haven’t
read my latest updates to that post, check it out!</p>

<p>But what if I told you that there exists an embedded project management tool
which ties you neither to a toolchain, nor to a development environment? Did I
mention it is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac?</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I’d like to introduce PlatformIO. I will go over what PlatformIO
is, how you can use it for your project, and what it is good at.  I also
highlight a few shortcomings worth keeping in mind.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>While I am not ready to give PlatformIO a full-throated endorsement for all
projects, it works very well for specific platforms and RTOS-es. Most
importantly, it proposes an approach to library and toolchain management for
embedded that is the best I’ve seen yet. I hope you will give it a whirl!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-platformio">What is PlatformIO?</h2>

<p><a href="https://platformio.org/" target="_blank">PlatformIO</a> is a set of open source tools targetted at professional embedded
developers.  Foremost of those tools is the PlatformIO Plugin for VSCode which
is used by hundreds of thousands of embedded developers to create, compile,
debug, and test embedded projects.</p>

<p>At its core, PlatformIO is made up of the following subsystems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Project management: a tool to create, configure, and manage projects</li>
  <li>Package management: a registry and a client to host libraries for embedded
systems and easily add or remove them from a project</li>
  <li>Build system: a build configuration and execution system. PlatformIO replaces
make, cmake, and others.</li>
  <li>Workflow automation: automation and integrations to debug, run unit tests,
run static analyzers, and other tools for your project.</li>
</ol>

<p>When it works, PlatformIO is magical. Want to start a project for STM32
STM32Cube, compiled with ARM GCC 5.2.1? No need to go find an SDK online, Simply
tweak a few configurations files, run a few CLI commands, and you’re off too the
races. We do this in the next section of this article.</p>

<p>However, the set of supported targets can be hit or miss.</p>

<h3 id="supported-targets">Supported Targets</h3>

<p>PlatformIO defines targets as a combination as three components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The “platform”, which is the MCU family. For example, both the STM32 and the
nRF52 are supported platforms.</li>
  <li>The “framework”, which is the SDK being used on the project. This includes
vendor SDK, such as the STM32Cube, as well as RTOS-es such as Zephyr or
FreeRTOS, true frameworks such as Arduino, and alternative APIs such as
libopencm3 and CMSIS.</li>
  <li>The “board” which defines the specific board you are using. PlatformIO comes
with hundreds of board configuration for popular development boards like the
STM32 Discovery boards.</li>
</ol>

<p>The headline numbers are impressive: 41 platforms, 23 frameworks, and 924 boards
as of this writing.</p>

<p>However, reality is a bit less rosy: while some MCU families are extremely well
covered, others have very little support.</p>

<p>One important example is official vendor SDK. PlatformIO only supports the
vendor SDKs for the following MCUs, which it considers individual “frameworks”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Espressif family (ESP8266, ESP32)</li>
  <li>Kendryte K210</li>
  <li>STM32</li>
  <li>Gigadevice GD32V</li>
  <li>SiFive FE310 and FU540</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are able to piggy back on an RTOS, things look a bit better. For example,
you can create a Zephyr project with PlatformIO for Atmel SAM, Freescale
Kinetis, Nordic nRF5, NXP iMX RT, NXP LPC, Silabs EFM32, and STM32.</p>

<p>You can use the PlatformIO client to list supported frameworks, platforms, and
boards. The list changes regularly, as the project is very active. Here’s the
command you want to run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # List platforms
  $ pio platform search
  
  # List frameworks
  $ pio platform frameworks
  
  # List boards
  $ pio boards
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="package-management">Package Management</h3>

<p>PlatformIO hosts a registry of embedded libraries which can be added to every
project. Popular libraries like the lwIP networking stack, the nanopb protocol
buffer implementation, or the mbedTLS SSL library are all available in one form
or another.</p>

<p>Here again, it is magical when it works. Simply add a library to your project by
calling <code>pio lib install</code> and rebuild your project. PlatformIO will fetch the
correct bundle, compile a static library, link it into your project, and expose
the header files.</p>

<p>However, the same issue with supported targets gets in the way of using
libraries. Each library lists frameworks and platforms it is compatible with,
and if yours is not listed you cannot use it. Of the more than 10,000 libraries
in the registry, only about 139 of them are compatible with the STM32 +
STM32Cube combo.</p>

<p>Anyone can publish a library to the repository, by following the excellent
online documentation<sup id="fnref:library_docs"><a href="#fn:library_docs">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Looking for packages is done with the <code>pio lib search</code> command. Here are a few
examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Look for all libraries that support STM32 + STM32Cube

$ pio lib search -n mbedtls

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Installing them is done with the <code>pio install</code> command.</p>

<h3 id="build-system">Build System</h3>

<p>PlatformIO is an opinionated system, and as long as you follow its rules
building a project with it is seamless. Simply add your project source under
<code>src</code>, your header files under <code>include</code>, and your private libraries under
<code>lib</code>. Run <code>pio run</code>, and you’re cooking with gas!</p>

<p>Under the hood, it uses the SCons<sup id="fnref:scons"><a href="#fn:scons">2</a></sup> build system. Most of the
time, this is of no consequence to the user as plenty of configuration options
are exposed via the <code>platformio.ini</code> file used to configure each project.</p>

<p>For example, you can change compiler and linker flags by adding the
<code>build_flags</code> variable to your <code>platformio.ini</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[env:release]
platform = ststm32
board = disco_f429zi
framework = stm32cube
build_flags = -Wall -Wl,--gc-sections
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Should you need to customize your build beyond what the <code>.ini</code> file provides,
you will need to write SCons scripts which are invoked by the PlatformIO build
environment. SCons scripts are written in Python.</p>

<p>Two hooks are available for those scripts: a PRE hook which runs before the
build executes, a POST hook which runs after the build. You can use these hooks
to change the build instructions for individual files, pre-process some source
code, or post-process the build artifacts<sup id="fnref:advanced_scripting"><a href="#fn:advanced_scripting">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While some may chafe at the need to learn yet another build system - I for one
still like my Makefiles - SCons is a mature and powerful build system.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-the-platformio-cli">Getting Started with the PlatformIO CLI</h2>

<p>My favorite way to use PlatformIO is with the CLI, also known as “PlatformIO Core”.
Although some people swear by the VSCode plugin, I prefer my PlatformIO separate
from my IDE so I can use trusty old Vim.</p>

<p>In this next section, I will walk you through installing the CLI, starting a
project, adding some libraries, and compiling your work. All code is available
in the the <a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt" target="_blank">Interrupt Github repository</a>,
under <code>example/platformio</code>.</p>

<h3 id="installing-the-cli">Installing the CLI</h3>

<p>Installing the PlatformIO CLI is easy. On some platform, you can use your
package manager. For example, on mac:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ brew install platformio
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For all other platforms, you can use the <code>get-platformio.py</code> script, available
on their website<sup id="fnref:get-platformio"><a href="#fn:get-platformio">4</a></sup>. Download it and run it with <code>python
get-platformio.py</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, you should have <code>platformio</code> available as a CLI utility, as well
as a <code>pio</code> alias for faster use.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-project">Creating a project</h3>

<p>The <code>pio</code> tool comes with project management commands. Let’s say we want to
start a new project for our STM32F429zi discovery board.</p>

<p>First, we’ll create a folder:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we’ll initialize the project with <code>pio project init</code>, and pass it a board
and a framework</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pio project init --board disco_f429zi --project-options "framework=STM32Cube"
...
Project has been successfully initialized! Useful commands:
`pio run` - process/build project from the current directory
`pio run --target upload` or `pio run -t upload` - upload firmware to a target
`pio run --target clean` - clean project (remove compiled files)
`pio run --help` - additional information
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="toolchains-and-linker-scripts">Toolchains and linker scripts</h3>

<p>On many of my projects, I use a specific version of the GCC toolchain, and to
write my own linker script. You’ll have to update your <code>platformio.ini</code> to
enable both of those things:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[env]
platform = ststm32
board = disco_f429zi
framework = stm32cube
platform_packages =
  ; GCC 4.8.4
  toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi@1.40804.0
board_build.ldscript = STM32F429ZIYX_FLASH.ld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>board_build.ldscript</code> bit is straightforward: simply point it at the path
to your linker script within the project folder.</p>

<p>The <code>platform_packages</code> variable is more complicated. This option lets you
override the version of built-in packages, such as the support for different
Frameworks, specific toolchains, or built-in tools like OpenOCD.</p>

<p>Tool Packages can be downloaded from Github, or from Bintray where the PlatformIO
project hosts many of its binaries. For example, you can the list of available
builds of GCC at
https://bintray.com/platformio/tool-packages/toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi-darwin_x86_64#files.<sup id="fnref:gcc-versions"><a href="#fn:gcc-versions">5</a></sup></p>

<p>In my case, I specified “toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi@1.40804.0” which is GCC 4.8.4
(see the “40804” part of the package version?).</p>

<p>Using a custom built toolchain is a whole other can of worm, which requires
creating your own platform package.</p>

<h3 id="writing-some-code">Writing some code</h3>

<p>Your code should go under the <code>src</code> folder. In my case, I added a <code>main.c</code> file
and wrote a simple blinky firmware:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"
</span>
<span>#define LED_PIN                                GPIO_PIN_5
#define LED_GPIO_PORT                          GPIOA

I’ve struggled most of this year to find ways of motivating myself, recording my successes, and finding ways to hold myself accountable. This hasn’t been to much of an issue in the past since I was able to leave my house to do fun physical activity but all of my workouts this year have had to be at home. It’s very easy keep sitting on the couch rather than getting up to do a home workout.</p> <p>I thankfully have an awesome group of coworkers that have formed a goal accountability group with me. The four of us meet every two weeks to talk about how we did with our goals and receive input on how to improve. My goal has been physical and mental health so that improves both my work life and my personal life.</p> <p>I don’t remember who brought this up in my group but my group members were willing to get daily notifications of my workout status from the day before. Not only would this motivate me and hold me accountable but my group members would also use this to motivate them with their goals. My first attempt at doing this was through todos in Basecamp. We had a Basecamp project for our accountability group so I created a new task for each day for two weeks that I would checkoff when I worked out. This ended up working but I wanted a solution that was easier to use, more visible on my phone, and not tied to our company Basecamp.</p> <p>One of my group members told me to make an app but… I make too many of those and I didn’t want to really support one another one 😆 I’ve been really into Shortcuts and widgets as of recent so I wanted decided that is how I wanted to make this. I knew I could make a simple menu system and store persistent data in a file but I wanted something a little more polished.</p> <p>I had luckily just discovered <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> and <a href="https://datajar.app/">Data Jar</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/simonbs">Simon</a>. Scriptable allows you you to automate and create custom widgets on iOS with Javascript and Shortcuts. Data Jar is a generic data storage for Shortcut. I knew I could just both of these to make what I wanted.</p> <p>Here is my current implementation… 😈</p> <hr> <h2 id="demo">Demo</h2> <p>There are three parts to this.</p> <ol> <li>Widget - displays a calendar-ish UI of days I exercised and stretched</li> <li>Logging Shortcut - menu shortcut that that store data and refreshes widget</li> <li>Automated Accountability Text - automated shortcut to text my coworkers whether I achieved my goals or not from the previous day</li> </ol> <h3 id="widget">Widget</h3> <p><img src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/widget.png" alt="Widget Screenshot"></p> <h3 id="logging-shortcut">Logging Shortcut</h3> <video width="100%" controls=""> <source src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/logging_shortcut.MP4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <h3 id="automated-accountability-text">Automated Accountability Text</h3> <p><img src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/text.jpg" alt="Text Screenshot"></p> <hr> <h2 id="implementation-with-scriptable-and-data-jar">Implementation with Scriptable and Data Jar</h2> <p>I went through <strong>a lot</strong> of different implementations of this. My first version had four scripts and three shortcuts. It worked but I was not happy with it. I now have one widget script, one shortcut for logging my health activities, and one shortcut that runs on an automation for sending my previous days activities to my coworkers.</p> <p>My requirements for this were:</p> <ul> <li>Persistent data stored in iCloud with dates I’ve exercised and stretched</li> <li>Widget built from persistent data</li> <li>Automated shortcut for notifying coworkers/friends my statuses from previous day</li> </ul> <h3 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h3> <p>That data format I’m storing looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{
	"Exercise": {
		"2020-12-07": "true"
	},
	"Stretching": {
		"2020-12-06": "true",
		"2020-12-07": "true"
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Data Jar is my primary storage. It offers easy to shortcuts, viewing and editing of data in app, and syncing of data over iCloud. Both of my shortcuts fetch and update my data with Data Jar.</p> <p>One of the problems I faced with using Data Jar was no Data Jar integration inside of Scriptable. I was thinking that Scriptable would have an API to fetch data from Data Jar but it does not 🤷‍♂️ That didn’t end up being too much of a problem though. In my Shortcut, I ended up passing the data from Data Jar into my Scriptable widget through a parameter. The Scriptable script will then cache that data passed in as a parameter and save it to Scriptable’s iCloud Drive. This cached data is only ever used as a read only by the widget.</p> <h3 id="logging-shortcut-1">Logging Shortcut</h3> <p>👉 <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/962ad0ba01da43b098eddbb3ce9390be">Install Shortcut</a></p> <p>My logging shortcut is really just a series of menus that adds/updates values in a dictionary. That dictionary is then stored in Data Jar and passed as a parameter into the Scriptable Widget.</p> <p>My Shortcut essentially looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>Logging shortcut reads and updates data with Data Jar</li> <li>Passes Data Jar data as a parameter into my widget script</li> <li>Widget script write data to a file in the Scriptable iCloud drive</li> <li>Widget UI is driven off of this file in the Scriptable iCloud drive</li> </ol> <p>⚠ Due to some OS issues, the Scriptable widget needs to be opened in Scriptable to refresh. Widgets are struggling to refresh from Shortcuts.</p> <video width="100%" controls=""> <source src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/shortcut_actions_log.MP4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <h3 id="widget-script">Widget Script</h3> <p>Scriptable’s app and API is so so nice but my javascript is not 😛 My script coudl be improved in so many ways but it works for now. Below is the high level workflow along with a gist.</p> <ul> <li>Write data to iCloud Drive (if passed in from Shortcut)</li> <li>Reads data from iCloud Drive</li> <li>Draws previous week, current week, and next week <ul> <li>Looks in exercise and stretching dictionaries for each day</li> <li>Draws salmon circle around day if exercised</li> <li>Draws blue line under day if stretched</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>⚠ This is <strong>ONLY</strong> designed for the medium widget right now because I made it for me and I’m lazy.</p> <p>Feel free to suggest any updates/improvements! I’d be happy to incorporate and reshare 😁</p>  <h3 id="automated-accountability-shortcut">Automated Accountability Shortcut</h3> <p>👉 <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7a8e8bfa63674e2c9c50beee47ff3a51">Install Shortcut</a></p> <p>My accountability shortcut reads the values from Data Jar to see if I exercised and stretched the previous day and then send that in a text message to my coworkers.</p> <p>There isn’t really much to it besides that 😇 You could easily change up the text part to an email or a tweet or whatever works best for you!</p> <video width="100%" controls=""> <source src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/shortcuts_actions_text.mov" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <hr> <h2 id="final-thoughts-and-future-plans">Final Thoughts and Future Plans</h2> <p>I’ve been using this for about four weeks now and I’m super happy with the results! The Shortcut is easy to use and the widget is better looking than I thought. The automated text that gets sent to my coworkers is working out great. There is not really an easy way for me to not send that it drives me to keep working out. That little bit of added peer pressure really does help 🙃</p> <p>Although, the best part is that I just really had fun time using Scriptable 🙂 I knew Scriptable was something I would enjoy but I was slightly unsure what I could use it for and a little intimidated at how to start. It turns out… I had no reason to be intimidated. There are plenty of examples to reference for inspiration. The docs are in the editor and are very easy to use. Support is also just an email away and very responsive if you run into anything that weird!</p> <p>I will definitely be keeping my healthy living log updated going forward. I’ll be modifying it to work for multiple widget sizes and track more/other things.</p> <p>Feel free to tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/joshdholtz">@joshdholtz</a> if you have any questions or suggestions on what I’ve written!</p> <p>I also want to give a big shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/simonbs">Simon</a> for making both Scriptable and Data Jar ❤ I’m so glad I could use these existing tools so that I didn’t have to start a new Xcode project to solve my problem 😉</p>     </div> </div></div>]]>

I decided to use the “progress over perfection” mantra by making sure the uploading, editing, removing, and retrieving of the photos, from a functionality point of view, was “perfect”</p><p>However, the way the user uploaded the photos and then viewing them was shocking, “perfect” was just a dot on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I went with it as I wanted to get the app published on both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1519992229">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.phhdigital.baitcamp">Google Play</a> as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>5 months after the initial idea came to me, I had published the app on both platforms. WAHOO!</p><p>After feedback from people testing version 1. And the fact I wasn’t happy with the photo upload/viewing features. I have been able to start work on version 1.1 to sort this problem out.</p><p>Another day or two and I will have a slick way of managing the photos. Be able to release an update very quickly.

I looked at my planner at what tasks I wanted to achieve over the last 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s on top of coding 3 software products by myself. Working 8-4 Monday through Thursday. And, having a life, like spending time with my wife, playing guitar, and going fishing.</p><p>It can be very overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>You see how great other people are at all these other things and want your stuff to be as “perfect” as theirs</p><p>That’s why this new mantra has been a bit of a breakthrough for me.</p><h2 id="h-progress-over-perfection-and-switching-your-mindset"><span id="Progress_Over_Perfection_and_Switching_Your_Mindset"></span>Progress Over Perfection and Switching Your Mindset<span></span></h2><p>As I’ve touched upon. For certain aspects of my day to day I would apply “progress over perfection”. Not all aspects though.</p><p>Hearing this really got me thinking about what I wanted to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing it also did was remove some fear I had around things.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I had started digging deep into the concept of creating online sales funnels to promote my products and reach my “golden goose” of 350 paying customers.</p><p>My dream is to work for myself running a software product. After a bit of number crunching, I worked out I would need 350 monthly subscribers for me to realize my dream.&nbsp;</p><p>Sales funnels could help me achieve this.</p><h3 id="h-sales-funnel-progress-over-perfection"><span id="Sales_Funnel_Progress_Over_Perfection"></span>Sales Funnel Progress Over Perfection<span></span></h3><p>This is where the fear kicked in. I was worried that I would create a sales funnel, it would completely bomb, and I would feel like a failure.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted my sales funnels to be successful as soon as I start driving traffic to it. If this were a software product, I wouldn’t think like that. I know they will be some bugs and users would probably want something different than what I had built.</p><p>After consuming a lot of content around the sales funnel process and how even the most experienced “funnel hackers” can’t get their funnel to work out of the gate.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided that I just need to get it out there and see what “feedback” I get.</p><p>So, I continued to put it together as best I could, giving myself a time constraint that it must be done by the end of that week. Then the week after I could drive some paid traffic to it.</p><p>I got the opt-in page up and running, where someone could submit their details and in return get a free eBook user guide.</p><p>Next, I spent most of my time working on the sales page and putting together an offer and pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, I added a “One Time Offer” that the person would be shown if they subscribed to the product I was promoting on the sales page.</p><p>Finally, I put together an email sequence that would be sent to anyone who opted in for the free eBook, as a follow up to get them to revisit my funnel.</p><p>The next week I created a Facebook ad campaign and got loads of people into the funnel. Guess how many sales I made?</p><p>ZERO.</p><h3 id="h-analyzing-the-results"><span id="Analyzing_the_Results"></span>Analyzing the Results<span></span></h3><p>Sounds terrible right? It was, but I wasn’t downhearted.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking into the stats, the opt-in page was working. I was getting almost 45% of the visitors to put in their email address and request a copy of the eBook.</p><p>Yes, no one bought from me. I knew that part of my sales funnel did work. However, I was building an email list of people that I could keep in contact with, which I hadn’t be able to do before.</p><p>“Progress over perfection”.</p><p>I ended up scrapping this funnel as I still didn’t ‘convert’ after a few attempts at rewriting parts of the sales page.</p><p>Taking the learnings from the opt-in success, I created a brand-new funnel. This targeted a different group of people. Again, this funnel wasn’t the success I wanted. My opt-in rate was still high, 35% and I got my first ever paying customer.</p><p>Someone signed up and subscribed to <a href="https://outflash.xyz/">my software product called Outflash</a>. They even took my up one-time offer.</p><p>I was blown away. Yes, it wasn’t the riches you pray for, but I had made progress on this skill.</p><p>Progress! Progress towards what I deem successful.</p><h2 id="h-podcasting-and-getting-yourself-out-there"><span id="Podcasting_and_Getting_Yourself_Out_There"></span>Podcasting and Getting Yourself Out There<span></span></h2><p>A problem with being a developer, is you think it will be like the movie Field of Dreams. “Build it and they will come”. With a software product, this NEVER happens.</p><p>Someone said if you want to get yourself out there to promote your products and services. Use a platform or media that you enjoy yourself. For me this was podcasting.</p><p>I’m an avid podcast listener. Whether it be working out, going for a run, listening while coding. I even put a podcast on while cooking a Sunday Dinner.</p><p>Starting a podcast can be scary though. What do I talk about? Do I have enough content to get past the first 10 episodes? How do I even publish a podcast? Which platforms do I publish to?</p><h3 id="h-excuses-excuses-just-do-it"><span id="Excuses,_Excuses,_Just_Do_It"></span>Excuses, Excuses, Just Do It<span></span></h3><p>Having mild success with the sales funnels gave me a lot of belief in the saying “Just Do It”.</p><p>One of the podcasts I listen to is by two guys that have launched their own podcasting hosting and publishing platform. I know, a bit Inception right!</p><p>So, I decided to use their platform to publish and host <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/podcast/">my podcast</a>. Which platforms to publish to? Their service had guides on how to publish to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/find-your-side-hustle/id1523991465">Apple</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL2ZpbmQteW91ci1zaWRlLWh1c3RsZQ?sa=X&amp;ved=0CBUQ27cFahcKEwiIrMe2-eLqAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ">Google podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/19pwsqTl75RSGrhhrsFIWW">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/find-your-side-hustle">Stitcher</a>. I didn’t overthink it, I registered with those 4 providers first and thought, “progress over perfection”, I can publish to more platforms later.</p><p>People also think they need a mass of equipment to record and edit a podcast. I was on a roll; nothing was stopping me from getting my first episode out to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Quickly opening Amazon and searching for “cheap podcast mic”.

December 8, 2020 | https://www.swyx.io/language-servers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.swyx.io/language-servers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>When Svelte 3 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19719118">launched</a> in 2019, the top demanded feature was TypeScript support. And when TypeScript support was <a href="https://twitter.com/sveltejs/status/1285627864310743043?lang=en">finally announced</a> in 2020, the reception was ecstatic.</p>
<p>But the secret is - not much needed to change in Svelte's core code. It simply added <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools">language tooling</a> to its core responsibilities. Svelte already had TypeScript preprocessors for years - but it wasn't considered to have "TypeScript support" until the VS Code extension shipped.</p>
<p>I think this is indicative of a broader trend:</p>
<p><strong>In the <a href="https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age/">Third Age of JavaScript</a>, all frameworks will provide their own language servers.</strong></p>
<p>By way of proof, you see this pattern emerging in other frameworks as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vetur">Vetur</a> is standard tooling for all Vue.js developers</li>
  <li>React strongly recommends <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#eslint-plugin">ESLint checks</a> to enforce the Rules of Hooks (this is probably an understatement; probably no React professional would trust themselves to write Hooks right without the ESLint checker today)</li>
  <li>Angular has the <a href="https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service">Angular Language Service</a> (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/mhartington/status/1335338641447587840">Mike</a>) and Ember is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable">working on it</a> (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/vaier/status/1335482247810592768?s=20">Alex</a>)</li>
  <li>Tailwind Labs' <a href="https://blog.tailwindcss.com/welcoming-brad-cornes-to-the-tailwind-team">first hire</a> was Brad Cornes, who made the Tailwind IntelliSense plugin</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a>, <a href="https://relay.dev/docs/en/installation-and-setup#set-up-relay-compiler">Relay Compiler</a> and <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/">Apollo VS Code</a> can be regarded as language servers for GraphQL development</li>
</ul>
<p>Linting, typing, always-running-compilation and other forms of write-time checks and optimizations are not new. In fact, when dev teams write unit tests and lint rules, they are essentially creating their own bespoke language server for their own app. What's new is that <strong>giving realtime feedback is now a responsibility shared by frameworks</strong>. This standardization increases productivity both when starting a new project and moving between projects.</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why</a></h2>
  <p>The proximate <em>reason</em> this is a thing is simple: Cost.</p>
  <p>IBM coined the term "<a href="https://devops.com/shift-left-can-you-be-left-out/">Shift Left</a>" after finding that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255965523_Integrating_Software_Assurance_into_the_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_SDLC">the earlier you catch errors, the cheaper they are to fix</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/mknz/status/1335351649720668161?s=20">Neil</a> points out that this research goes as far back as <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/real-cost-change-software">Barry Boehm in the 1980s</a>). If you arrange the software development lifecycle from left (design) to right (production), the idea is that if you shift your errors "left" then you'd save actual money by catching errors earlier (<a href="https://gist.github.com/Morendil/6d664bf990c17ea0f88f9bb0cc403c64">this is disputed</a>).</p>
  <p>Of course, the flip side of Cost is <em>Developer Experience</em>. <strong>Cost is what our bosses pay, DX is what we <em>feel</em></strong>. And we always gravitate to tools that guide us down the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">pit of success</a>.</p>
  <p>You could translate this idea to modern terms:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4nyfjt36m2ueummlqfsc.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>And then plot the slow leftward shift of frameworks:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3xvu11v9ayvaxnakzsk9.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>Remember I said cost was a <em>proximate</em> reason. I believe there's a deeper, more fundamental reason.</p>

  <h2 id="tom-was-right-and-still-is"><a href="#tom-was-right-and-still-is">Tom was Right (and still is)</a></h2>
  <p>In 2017, Tom Dale of the Ember core team observed the first part of this evolution, that <a href="https://tomdale.net/2017/09/compilers-are-the-new-frameworks/">Compilers are the New Frameworks</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>My current “investment thesis” is that what we call web frameworks are transforming from runtime libraries into optimizing compilers. When it comes to eking performance out of hand-authored JavaScript and accompanying runtime libraries, we’ve reached the point of diminishing returns.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He was not only astoundingly right (Svelte is built from the ground up as a compiler) but this process is also not done (Next.js is arguably an optimizing compiler for React, but the React team itself is working on Selective Hydration and a <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1259615094163607561">hybrid client/server model</a>). Every framework basically invents its own metalanguage (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiR9viVIJgo">React</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/0f910048478c2a6505d1c32185b61934">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@llkktt/blog-707634e025cf">ActiveRecord</a>) to solve for developer experience under constraints of a more popular general purpose language, and this language will eventually want to be compiled.</p>
  <p>I'm simply extending this train of thought to its natural conclusion: what we call web frameworks are transforming from runtime libraries, into optimizing compilers <em>with first class language server support</em>.</p>
  <p>I don't know how unique this observation is but it felt revelatory <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1259121891555467264?s=20">when I first realized it</a>. After you observe the evolution of a few frameworks and developer platforms you start seeing the same movie play out over and over again. To offer better developer experience, you end up creating a language. A language needs a compiler. A compiler eventually wants a language server.</p>

  <h2 id="sell-the-shovels"><a href="#sell-the-shovels">Sell the Shovels</a></h2>
  <p>Language servers do a lot of <a href="https://jeremybower.com/articles/undifferentiated-heavy-lifting-2-0.html">undifferentiated heavy lifting</a> - file watching, processing, reporting, supporting plugins for every IDE, and so on. If we're all going to be building language servers, why do we have to reinvent the wheel every time?</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/s1ixc6yvv6b1xfj10ate.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>Naturally, if language servers are the new bar for frameworks, those who <em>own</em> the common rails for the language server layer will do very well. Microsoft first developed the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for VSCode and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3088698/microsoft-backed-langauge-server-protocol-strives-for-language-tools-interoperability.html">standardized it in 2017</a>. This was a generous move that ensured the protocol would work with non-Microsoft IDEs like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/may/article1.php">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-7409">IntelliJ</a> and even <a href="https://www.vimfromscratch.com/articles/vim-and-language-server-protocol/">vim</a>, and non-Microsoft languages like <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/07/01/pylance-vs-code.aspx">Python</a>. Because LSP is ironically language and tooling agnostic, you also greatly lower the barrier for entire generations of language and editor agnostic startups, like <a href="https://langserver.org/">Sourcegraph</a> and <a href="https://www.kite.com/">Kite</a>.</p>
  <p>Here's my advice for anyone who wants to make their dev tools project successful: <strong>time to learn how language servers work.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Author's note: Orta from the TS core team <a href="https://dev.to/orta/comment/18o1d">left a great comment</a> with more resources to learn about LSPs from Anders Hejlsberg and a coming "Build Server Protocol"!</p>

I acknowledge the importance of having a schedule, but chunking my creative time into slots on a calendar feels like I’m sacrificing the freedom required to unearth interesting ideas.</p><p>Oftentimes, being able to name the problem goes a long way, and I’d like to delineate between the two styles of thought here:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><span><strong>Focused Thought</strong></span> is what guides our work lives, primarily because it’s tied to a practical end result. This result has been imagined from the beginning, so Focused Thought is about investing the energy necessary to have the present moment catch up with that future goal. The most pressing example today would be all the people working tirelessly to create a coronavirus vaccine. They embarked on this journey knowing exactly what they wanted, and they will rigorously follow whatever road looks promising to get them to that goal.</p><p><span><strong>Fluid Thought</strong></span>, on the other hand, has no end state in mind. It’s thinking for the sake of thinking. There is no practical value to extract, no expectation to fulfill. It’s like being in a rowboat in a vast ocean without any particular place to go. All you must do is row aimlessly, and take in all the observations you make along your little journey.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fluid Thought is about emptying any desire to be productive or useful, and instead becoming a blank canvas for whatever your curiosity comes into contact with. An idea is no longer interesting because of what you can do with it; it’s interesting simply because it’s interesting. You don’t need to <a href="https://moretothat.com/knowledge-is-not-a-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">store it as knowledge</a> to regurgitate later, as coming into contact with it is all that matters.</p><p>This is a remarkably difficult thing to do, especially because we’ve been conditioned to learn with an end goal in mind. From grade school to college, we learn things because we have an exam to pass. When we enter the workplace, we learn because we want to “add value” to our team (and get paid in the process). When we do creative work, we learn because we want to build things that are useful for our audience.</p><p>The problem, however, is that all this conditioning goes against the actual nature of our minds. If you take 10 minutes to sit down and do nothing, you’ll see how random and sporadic your thoughts actually are. The mind is exploratory by nature, but we’ve trained it to think linearly because we have been incentivized to prioritize Focused Thought. After all, the more we tie our worth to <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-omnipresence-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the societal value we produce</a>, the more goal-oriented we become.</p><p>Fluid Thought is a return to how our minds actually work. Exploring without expecting is <a href="https://moretothat.com/what-is-the-present-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what it means to be present</a>. Thinking without striving is <a href="https://moretothat.com/happiness-is-a-serious-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what it means to be introspective</a>. By putting aside the desire to make something out of everything, we allow our childlike wonderment to re-emerge and learn from a truly earnest place.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>I try to keep this in mind as I navigate my path as a writer.</p><p>Since writing is such a cognitively demanding exercise, it’s dominated by the presence of Focused Thought. This is even more relevant since I also publish my work, which means that I can’t just blurt out random thoughts on a page, and expect the result to be cohesive enough to be digested by another mind. I have to take time to formulate my thoughts, let them marinate, and structure them so that they’re clear enough to whoever might come across my work.</p><p>However, writing with an end goal in mind makes my thinking rigid, and cuts off the tangential threads that are unwoven naturally when thought is more exploratory. Too much linear thinking can make writing feel like a task, where the completion of one piece just means that it’s time to go looking for another topic to discuss. Repeat this process long enough, and you can see why so many people become disillusioned with it fairly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fortunately, there is an antidote to this, and it applies to any form of expression:</p><p><span><strong>Introduce time for Fluid Thought on a regular basis.</strong></span></p><p>By giving yourself the space to explore without expectation, you give your mind the freedom to play with whatever idea it comes into contact with. There is nothing that idea has to become; there is nothing you need to store to use for later. All that matters is that you’re wandering about, spending time in a playground that will disappear shortly afterward.</p><p>The way I put this into practice is by journaling every single day. I think in the last two years, I may have missed just two sessions – that’s how important the practice is to me.</p><p>This is because journaling carries no expectations, and gives me the space to write without any judgment whatsoever. When I open up my journal each day, I have no clue what will be written down by the end of the entry. All I do is put my pen to paper, and have my hand act as a mere conduit to whatever my mind wants to explore. It can be nonsensical, it can be stupid, it can be forgotten.</p><p>And all of that is perfectly fine.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Perhaps the greatest thing about Fluid Thought is that it reintroduces the beginner’s mind, or what the Zen Buddhists call <em>shoshin</em>. When you have no expectations, you drop all the defense mechanisms you’ve developed in your <a href="https://moretothat.com/pursue-mastery-not-status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuit of mastery</a>, and reset your curiosity back to its baseline levels. This allows you to experiment with all kinds of novel ideas, as you have nothing to lose by doing so.</p><p>The same thing applies in the realm of learning. So much of what we learn is done for the purposes of what we can teach. But with Fluid Thought, we can read a book simply to enjoy it, without expecting any knowledge or wisdom in return for our attention. This is why I’ve been reading more fiction these days, as I know that I’m not delving into the pages so I can find material to write about afterward. I’m there to get lost in the story, and to be part of an adventure that is devoid of any obvious personal utility.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The paradox of Fluid Thought is that it’s easily accessible, but is difficult to enter into. This is because we live in a world where we are rewarded to provide value, so Focused Thought will always feel more practical. An efficient hustle receives far more praise than an aimless meander, so having goals and visions will be the default setting our minds operate on.</p><p>But take this mindset out too far, and we will forever be slaves to the future. Focused Thought is inherently about looking ahead, whereas Fluid Thought is about being immersed in the moment. Paradoxically, you must balance both by dropping your present expectations to position yourself toward a brighter future.</p><p>I’m reminded here of a Daoist concept called <em>wu-wei</em>, which roughly translates to “effortless action.” It’s about moving alongside the fabric of reality with action, but doing it in a seamless manner so you don’t create friction. To maintain a sense of serenity while meeting the demands of your everyday life.</p><p>In the end, that might be the best way to frame the power of Fluid Thought.</p><p>_______________</p><div id="custom_html-5"><div><div>  <p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png"><img src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png" alt="" width="1500" height="790"></a></p><p>  If you enjoyed this post, consider joining the More To That newsletter.

"That is what happened to Chris and to Republicans all across the country, who truthfully, and based on their substantial experience, are upholding the integrity of the election in the face of a false narrative regarding its results."</p>  <p>Krebs is seeking financial damages from diGenova, Newsmax and the Trump campaign.</p>  <p>Newsmax said in response to questions about the suit that it has no official ties to diGenova, who was appearing on a syndicated radio program whose content is licensed by the network. It noted that his remarks about Krebs were "inappropriate" but that he did not intend for them to be taken seriously and he has apologized.</p>  <p>"Newsmax believes that claims made by Mr. Krebs in his suit of a 'conspiracy' and defamation against him are a threat to free speech and his legal action endangers all media organizations that seek an open discourse of ideas and news," the network said.</p>  <p>The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>    <p>A former Microsoft executive, Krebs ran the agency, known as CISA, from its creation in the wake of Russian interference with the 2016 election through the November election. He won bipartisan praise as CISA co-ordinated federal state and local efforts to defend electoral systems from foreign or domestic interference.</p>  <p>CISA issued a statement in November with a coalition of government and industry election officials from around the country that defended the 2020 election as the "most secure in American history." It was widely viewed as a direct repudiation of Trump's efforts to undermine the integrity of the contest.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>In the <a href="https://river.codes/emulating-a-computer-part-1/">last part of this series</a> we built a CHIP-8 interpreter to execute all opcodes except for one, <code>Dxyn - DRW Vx, Vy, nibble</code>. To make this process easier, we’ll encapsulate our image memory and operations in an <code>Image</code> class. Our 64x32 frame will be represented as a single chunk of data in memory, where each pixel is a single byte:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0x000:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
0x040:|                                                              |
0x080:|                                                              |
0x0C0:|                                                              |
      ...
0x7C0:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For our image above, we need to store three pieces of data: the number of rows, number of cols, and the starting address of the image memory (which <a href="https://river.codes/demystifying-malloc"><code>malloc</code></a> gives us). With this address pointing to the top-left corner of the memory, addressing individual pixels is fairly trivial. Some examples:</p> <div><div><pre><code>img[col=0, row=0] = img[0]
img[col=0, row=1] = img[width]
img[col=1, row=3] = img[3*width+1]
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Okay, we should be ready to write the header.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// image.h</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>I like to use rows and columns here rather than x and y because I rarely forgot what a row is, but I often forget what an “x” is. Our <code>At</code> function returns a <code>uint8_t&amp;</code> so that we can use it for both getting and setting individual pixels. This is bad for encapsulation, but is common among image APIs. We also added a handy <code>DrawToStdout</code> so that we can view the image in our console until we set up graphical output later. Now we can add our frame to the CPU and work out an implementation.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.h</span>

<span>class</span> <span>CpuChip8</span> <span>{</span>
 <span>public:</span>
  <span>constexpr</span> <span>innt</span> <span>kFrameWidth</span> <span>=</span> <span>64</span><span>;</span>
  <span>constexpr</span> <span>innt</span> <span>kFrameHeight</span> <span>=</span> <span>32</span><span>;</span>

  <span>CpuChip8</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>frame_</span><span>(</span><span>kFrameWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>kFrameHeight</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
  <span>...</span>
 <span>private:</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>Image</span> <span>frame_</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Finally we’ll talk about how CHIP-8 performs drawing. All drawing is done in terms of an XOR operation of a sprite onto the current and only frame buffer. All sprites are defined as images with a depth of 1-bit (each pixel on or off), a width of 8, and a variable height. The width limitation is due to the fact that each pixel in the sprite is only a single bit. Let’s take a look at the fontset earlier and try to decode a digit.</p> <div><div><pre><code>0xF0, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xF0, // 0

0xF0 is 1111 0000 -&gt; XXXX
0x90 is 1001 0000 -&gt; X  X
0x90 is 1001 0000 -&gt; X  X
0x90 is 1001 0000 -&gt; X  X
0xF0 is 1111 0000 -&gt; XXXX
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Pretty cool! So when I said that drawing is done as an XOR operation, the only way to remove a sprite from the screen is to draw over it (1 ⊕ 1 is 0). This is why you often see flickering in CHIP-8 programs, the sprite is continuously drawing and un-drawing to depict movement.</p> <p>Okay we’re just about ready to write a sprite drawing function. We’re going to need a starting point and a sprite (a chunk of memory). Since sprite height is variable, we’ll receive that parameter too. One thing that took me quite a long time to debug is that the CHIP-8 interperter supports drawing out of bounds. When that happens, the draw continues as it wraps around. This also works for the starting coordinates of the (so drawing at 255,255 for 15 rows is perfectly valid). Also, the interpreter needs to receive back whether or not a pixel was turned off (this is often used for collision detection).</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// image.cpp</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For some reason, I've found that in my career a lot of the work I do ends up involving slow REPL loops: I make a change, run a command, wait for it to finish, and repeat. While I'm sitting there waiting, it's easy to be distracted by things, and I want my task to bring itself back to my attention when it's ready. This desire has led me on a multi-year quest to tailor my notifications perfectly, and in this post I'm going to share what I've come up with.</p>
<p>Here are the features I want my notifications to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should be able to activate them from anywhere in the terminal: in bash, from the ruby console, over SSH, or anywhere else I find myself (in the terminal).</li>
<li>They should be subtle so they don't get too annoying, but noticeable enough that I don't miss them.</li>
<li>The should only fire when I want them: too many notifications will cause me to ignore all of them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The early days</h2>
<p>Back in 2015 or so, my company was writing scrapers to extract detailed, structured information from hundreds of websites. Each website was different and since we needed the information to be structured, we had to write a different scraper for each one. A single site could be scraped in about 5 minutes, and the data only changed a few times each year. Still, the sites would change often enough that I frequently found myself sitting in the office until late at night, mostly waiting for these scrapers to break so I could make one small fix, and repeat. Five minutes for each change really adds up when you have to repeat the entire scraper to test a single-line change.</p>
<p>Fortunately, writing scrapers is pretty easy technically, so I didn't need to be 100% focused as I was working on them. That meant that while I was waiting on the latest change I'd made to a scraper, I was able to focus on other high-value activities like shooting for a high score in Peggle Nights.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1309-peggle-small.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Peggle Nights"></p>
<p>But sometimes, when I was planning a tough shot on a high-scoring round, I could forget that I was still at the office waiting for my scraper to crash so I could fix it. That's why I wanted a simple way to get notified when it was waiting for me. My first-ever attempt at building a notifications system used a feature built-in to Mac OS: the <code>say</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>long_running_command<span>;</span> say <span>"done"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This command uses the system's text-to-speech to play through your computer speakers. The scrapers I was writing were mostly in Ruby, so if I were in IRB I could still get the notification:</p>
<pre><code>my_scraper<span>.</span>run_main <span>rescue</span> ex <span>=</span> $<span>!</span><span>;</span> `say done`
</code></pre>
<p>This will play the notification even if the scraper fails, and preserve the raised exception in the <code>ex</code> variable. Neat!</p>
<p>I used this solution for a few months, but I always felt that the text-to-speech was a little unpleasant. I decided to switch out the <code>say</code> command for the built-in audio file player, <code>afplay</code>, and I used one of the default sounds that comes with Mac OS.</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
  afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
<span>}</span>
long_running_command<span>;</span> ding

<p>That makes this sound, which is a little more subtle than a robotic voice shouting at me.</p>

<p>These two tricks got me along just fine for years. I felt like I had solved the problem and didn't need to think about it any more. Well, except when I started a command that I thought would be fast but it instead took an hour to run. But I developed a trick for that: if you press <code>^Z</code> (Ctrl-Z) to pause the job, then you can use <code>fg; ding</code> to resume it  and ding when it finishes. There. Now it's perfect.</p>
<h2>Improving on perfection</h2>
<p>One day I learned about <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2 shell integration</a>. This provides a bunch of neat features, and one of them is about notifications! It's not very well documented, but if you use Edit ► Marks and Annotations ► Alerts ► Alert on Next Mark, or the much-easier-to-remember Option-Command-A, you'll get a native notification when the currently running command finishes. I installed the shell integration and to this day I use this feature more than anything else that it provides.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020 and I've changed roles again. This time, I find myself automating cloud server provisioners, and waiting for the machines to come up isn't fast. Sadly, the iTerm shell integration has to be installed on each server, and my perfect notification scripts don't work over SSH. Realizing that perfection is a journey and not a destination, I set out to improve my notifications once again. Except this time, I was going to go industrial-strength.</p>
<p>When I was learning about the iTerm2 shell integration, I also found out about <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/11/25/iterm-plugins/">a bunch of other features that iTerm2 supports</a>. If you want to follow along with me, read over that post and install <code>PlaySound.py</code>, <code>iterm_notify</code>, <code>iterm_badge</code>, and <code>iterm_bounce</code> on your computer. These new features had already made my notifications more powerful and SSH-compatible, but I had set my sights beyond a simple "ding!" sound. I wanted a smart notification system that would "ding" when the command completed, but "bonk" when it failed. But first I needed to find the right sounds to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1344-oot-navi.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"></p>
<p>The first sound that came to mind was the iconic "Hey! Listen!" from Ocarina of Time. If you played this game, then you probably know exactly how that sounds. I found a gallery of <a href="http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounds from the Zelda games</a> and searched for some appropriate ones. Eventually I settled on these two, for my "good" and "bad" sounds:</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>The first thing to do is wrap them up in scripts to make them easy to use. I put them in my sound library (which is listing in <a href="https://github.com/CGamesPlay/dotfiles/blob/bee7d071a7b85f7becc696edc0b328677eb16c40/macos/Library/Application%20Support/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch/PlaySound.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlaySound.py</a>) and wrote these:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound OOT_PressStart
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>bonk</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound MM_Tatl_Alarm.wav
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can run my provisioning script like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
</code></pre>
<p>If the script succeeds, the <code>&amp;&amp; ding</code> will run, resulting in a pleasant chime. Otherwise the <code>|| bonk</code> sound will run and I'll hear a nervous fairy. But I can do better! This is too much to type, and I want to leverage all of my notification channels, not just sound. So I wrote this function:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>sound_status</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>last_status</span><span>=</span><span>$?</span>
    <span>test</span> <span>$last_status</span> -eq <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
    iterm_bounce
    <span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>"<span>$@</span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"Command finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>else</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"<span>$@</span> finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>fi</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>$last_status</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This function has 3 important qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>It automatically chooses the sound to play.</li>
<li>It also shows a system notification, with an optional custom message.</li>
<li>It passes on the exit code, so you can run it in a pipeline.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, I can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh<span>;</span> sound_status <span>"provision.sh"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>ssh</span> myhost
</code></pre>
<p>Because it passes on the exit status, the <code>&amp;&amp; ssh</code> will only happen when the command succeeds, just like if the <code>; sound_status</code> hadn't been there at all.</p>
<h2>The little things in life</h2>
<p>This notification script feels great: simple, only when requested, and with just a bit of "fun" flavor. But there is another area where I think that a subtle audio cue would help streamline my workflow. Sometimes I need to type 3 or 4 quick commands back-to-back. Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>git</span> commit -m <span>"respond to feedback"</span>
no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
$ <span>git</span> push
Everything up-to-date
</code></pre>
<p>I run these commands, see that it succeeded, shut my laptop, and head out to lunch. Later that day I wonder why nobody has reviewed my code, only to find that the second command had failed because I never staged those files, so I never pushed any changes at all. If I had been more careful, this wouldn't have happened. As a substitute for being more careful, I can have the computer tell me when my commands fail!</p>
<p>When I want is a subtle ping to tell me that something bad happened, every time a command fails. A lot of times this notification will be unnecessary. For example, if  <code>make</code> fails with a compile error, I don't really need a sound to tell me about that. So I wanted a "negative" sound that wasn't too distracting. I eventually settled on this one.</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>Can you recognize it? It's a sound you'll have heard pretty often if you've ever played Factorio: the notification that a building you own has been destroyed. In the game, you'll often hear this sound altering you of an attack while you're working on some other task. Generally, it indicates a problem, but not necessarily an urgent one. I thought it would be perfect. Since I'm a user of <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fish shell</a>, I rigged up the notification like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>$beep_command</span>
  <span>set</span> beep_command <span>"printf <span title="\a">\a</span>"</span>
end
<span>set</span> beep_primed <span>""</span>
<span>function</span> beep_preexec --on-event fish_preexec
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>1</span>
end
<span>function</span> beep_postexec --on-event fish_postexec
  <span>set</span> -l last_status <span>$status</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>test</span> <span>!</span> -z <span>$beep_primed</span> -a <span>!</span> -z <span>$argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> -a <span>$last_status</span> -ne <span>0</span>
    <span>eval</span> <span>$beep_command</span>
  end
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>""</span>
end
</code></pre>
<p>There's a few things worth mentioning here:</p>
<ul>
<li>To set the beep command, I used <code>set -U beep_command "iterm_sound Factorio/alert-destroyed.wav"</code>. This sets a "<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#variable-scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal variable</a>" in fish, so it's permanent and system-wide. This lets me change the sound easily whenever I want.</li>
<li>The <code>fish_postexec</code> command runs even if you didn't run a command (pressed enter at an empty prompt), so we use the <code>-z $argv[1]</code> to filter that out.</li>
<li>The <code>beep_primed</code> variable is needed to ensure that the sound only happens once when the command fails. This is necessary to avoid some awkward situations that come up when you press Ctrl-C to cancel a command.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's where I am today. I am very happy with how my notifications work and I'm glad I was able to add a unique bit of flavor to them by sampling from some nostalgic video games. Thanks for reading! If you want to set up something like this and are having problems, feel free to <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/contact">reach out to me</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>In this post, Sandeep Vaheesan interviews Frank Pasquale about his forthcoming book,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975224">New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI</a>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sandeep Vaheesan:</strong> Your book is powerful, deep, and a pleasure to read. It will be a major contribution to raging debates over democracy, the power of the tech sector, and what constitutes utopia (or dystopia). The book strikes at trans-ideological myths that have driven the discourse and shaped policy for the past few decades. What is the genesis of this work?</p>



<p><strong>Frank Pasquale:</strong> Thanks very much for those kind words, Sandeep. I appreciate your focus on myths, because one of the main purposes of a book like this is to vindicate some common sense about the value of labor, in the face of elaborately mathematicised economics that has lost sight of the purpose of economic growth.</p>



<p>My central argument is that AI and robotics most often complement, rather than replace, human labor, and that in many areas, we should maintain this status quo. Our technology policy should ensure that AI increases wages for most workers, rather than supplanting them.</p>



<blockquote><p>My central argument is that AI and robotics most often complement, rather than replace, human labor, and that in many areas, we should maintain this status quo. Our technology policy should ensure that AI increases wages for most workers, rather than supplanting them.</p></blockquote>



<p>Those goals are not terribly controversial—governments and political parties around the world claim to advance them. What politicians have ever said they want to cut jobs? But they do tend to favor capital over labor, and stock markets love layoffs. Rentiers can invest in politicians just as they do in stocks and bonds. And when they do so, a key concern is short-term profits, rather than longer-term investment in a more sustainable and inclusive economy.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t just a problem of corruption and improper influence. The economics of automation needs an overhaul. The leading figures in the field rarely make normative judgments about what the economy ought to accomplish or provide. They are so caught up in abstractions, they can’t grapple with the climate or COVID or inequality catastrophes in front of their faces.</p>



<p>I recall hearing one economist talking about how persons that make under $24 an hour are very likely to be replaced by robots, and those making above $48 an hour are very unlikely to be automated out of their jobs. The lesson, according to President Obama’s Chair of Economic Advisors, was that <a href="https://robotonomics.wordpress.com/2016/07/12/whitehouse-chairman-of-economic-advisors-why-we-need-more-artificial-intelligence/">education and job training</a> are key. I don’t disagree on that—<em>New Laws of Robotics </em>promotes both universal college education and targeted training opportunities. But I go much further. I don’t presume that all the well-paid jobs are all that socially useful. Rather, I propose ways to channel investment in AI and robotics toward human services that actually meet important needs, and away from a broad class of tech devoted to ranking, rating, sorting, and punishing people. I think that much of that AI—ranging from police robots to credit scores based on social media profiles to affective computing–is vastly overrated and creepy. (To paraphrase Ryan Calo: there are problems both if it fails to work, and if it works too well!) &nbsp;So <em>New Laws of Robotics </em>enthusiastically embraces the industrial policy that mainstream economics primly sidesteps to maintain a façade of neutrality.</p>



<p><strong>Sandeep Vaheesan: </strong>An important theme of your book is that technology is not an autonomous force. Too often, technology is presented as existing apart from society and periodically shaking up, or “disrupting,” supposedly problematic arrangements—think of the earlier narrative on Uber and the traditional cab industry. You do an excellent job discrediting this view and explaining that the direction and the pace of technological change are a product of human decision-making. How do you see technological change happening at present and what would a more democratic model be?</p>



<p><strong>Frank Pasquale: </strong>At present, the money goes where the perceived market is. So at the margin, if a VC has to decide on whether to invest in AI that, say, improves radiological exams (possibly catching cancer or other abnormalities earlier), or AI that boosts “employee engagement” by tracking eye movements—well, it depends on what can bring in massive profits faster. And there are some structural features that make health care the worse bet. Privacy laws are stricter in health care, so it may be harder to get the data. For a long time, health care providers have been pretty fragmented, so the radiology AI salesperson might need to visit hundreds of different offices to get buy-in. The technology needs to be validated, often with rigorous testing. And most importantly, insurers (both public and private) may not want to pay for the new technology, and thus may make it difficult for conscientious, forward-thinking radiologists to implement it well. In much of the private sector, the exact opposite is the case: there is no insurer judging the transaction, concentration is rampant, validation is an afterthought, and privacy laws are both weaker than HIPAA and less well-enforced.</p>



<p>Now, one vision for accelerating AI in health care is to get rid of features I just mentioned: suspend HIPAA and human subjects research protections, while vertically integrating care teams into massive corporations (perhaps run by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/amazon-jp-morgan-berkshire-hathaway-health-care-venture-named-haven.html">billionaires</a>). Maybe an Amazon hospital network can hire Amazon doctors, while an Amazon-Uber partnership takes over ambulance service and an Amazon pharmacy negotiates to reduce drug prices. Advances in AI could be tucked into that behemoth. Top managers in Seattle could gather data across hundreds of institutions, ranking and rating physicians based on patient outcomes. To the extent the Trump Administration has an AI policy, it’s that: shovel more money and power to the biggest American tech firms so they can keep up surveillance capitalism and merger sprees.</p>



<p>My book goes in a very different direction. I’d give professionals like doctors and nurses more autonomy to build a better health care system, while crafting incentives for them to take on more governance and research roles. I’d also encourage the professionalization of work that is now undervalued, like home health care. Would you rather see your parents or grandparents “cared for” by a robot (even cute ones, like the <a href="http://www.parorobots.com/">Paro</a> robotic seal, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/robear-bear-shaped-nursing-care-robot">RoBear</a>), or would you rather such technology be introduced to them by caring and well-trained professionals, who can spark conversations about the robot?</p>



<blockquote><p>Would you rather see your parents or grandparents “cared for” by a robot (even cute ones, like the <a href="http://www.parorobots.com/">Paro</a> robotic seal, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/robear-bear-shaped-nursing-care-robot">RoBear</a>), or would you rather such technology be introduced to them by caring and well-trained professionals, who can spark conversations about the robot?</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Sandeep Vaheesan</strong>: Your case for professionalism departs from the bipartisan consensus of our times. Centrists and libertarians alike have condemned professions as “anticompetitive guilds” and called for weakening their power. While this may have a kernel of truth for law, medicine, and other fields in which professionals can earn substantial incomes, the critique has been leveled against florists, hair stylists, and others who typically do not make six figures. What are the economic and political arguments for not only maintaining but expanding professionalism in American society? What are some advantages of professional market governance relative to corporate market governance?</p>



<p><strong>Frank Pasquale</strong>: One reason I wrote the book was a sense that professionals were getting a bad rap from all sides: left, right, and centrist. The right abhors worker interference in “labor markets,” while promoting capital’s autonomy to maximize its own <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3337861">coordination power</a>. The more anarchist strands of the left challenge epistemic authority as a mere assertion of power. And attacks on occupational licensing are catnip for centrists, who can convene left and right to erode the hard-won rights of professionals in order to “level the playing for labor”—downward, of course.</p>



<p>For this book, I kept asking: what would it look like to level the labor playing field up? How could a nurse enjoy something like the <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_callaci/status/1300228791743193090">security of position</a> that professors have? How could professors take a larger role in governing their universities, in the way nurses’ unions have successfully done in many areas? What would it look like for workers in logistics, cleaning, agriculture, and mining to unionize and professionalize, demanding a greater say in how technology was adopted in their fields?</p>



<p>If you take any of these questions individually, they may smack of unjustifiable privilege. And if a teacher were to simply say “please don’t develop educational AI so I can keep earning a salary,” that’s not a good argument for stopping it (just as horse-and-buggy drivers should not have been allowed to stop the development of cars).</p>



<p>However, as I explain in detail in my chapter on education, there is much more that teachers can say to justify their role. No robot or AI is anywhere near the competence of the median teacher. Even if they do advance in important ways, I still foresee teachers standing between students and educational AI the way a doctor stands between patients and prescription drugs. Teachers both help produce, and gather, data on which educational AI (such as chatbot teaching assistants) depends. TeachersSandeep Vaheesan interviews Frank Pasquale about his forthcoming book, New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI. actually know students personally, while a distant “edtech vendor” may see them simply as revenue streams. If a test is badly graded by an AI, a teacher can stand as an immediately accessible “person-in-the-loop,” to review it. That is distributed, in-person, democratized expertise—something that dominant, autocratic corporate forms cannot replicate.</p>

<br><a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing.html">Notes on writing papers</a>

Here's a quote from the paper "Document Production: Visual or Logical?"
in Notices of the American Mathematical Society (June 1987), pages 621-624,
by LaTeX author Leslie Lamport:
<blockquote>
The purpose of writing is to convey ideas to the reader.
The worst aspect of visual systems
is that they subvert the process of communicating ideas
by encouraging the writer to concentrate on form rather than content.
Ideas are conveyed by the logical structure of the text;
the function of the visual format is to display this structure.
The author should be concerned with the structure,
not any particular visual representation.
</blockquote>
Here's another quote:
<blockquote>
Document design is a skill acquired through training and experience.
A logical system can apply the skill of a trained designer
to the formatting of a document.
</blockquote>
<p>
Let's see how well this worked for one of my papers,
a paper that was forced to switch visual formats.

But then I found out that the book containing my paper
would use the "msripub" format
designed by MSRI book editor Silvio Levy.
Here's what happens when the same document is formatted
with "msripub" rather than "amsart":

Wow, that's a really pleasant document to read!
I love the huge chunks of white space,
the visually stunning bibliography,
the completely non-functional citations to that bibliography,
the entertaining little black boxes everywhere,
and the line on page 24 sticking not merely into the margin but beyond the printed area of the page.
I'm glad that I concerned myself solely with the structure of my document,
and not with any particular visual representation.
</p><p>
This document must have been first seen by Levy,
who was not merely the skilled "msripub" designer
but also the editor of this particular book.
Surely he was inspired by the document's near-perfect beauty
and thought that a few additional tweaks
would produce a truly stunning work of art.
The scientific editors of the book waited for Levy to act.
But Levy did nothing.
Perhaps the explanation lies in Lamport's wise words:
</p><blockquote>
A logical system forces the writer
to think in terms of the document's logical structure;
it doesn't give him the illusion
that he is accomplishing anything with cosmetic formatting changes.
</blockquote>
<p>
In any event,
I wasn't able to see the "msripub" version of the document until April 2007.
Levy never sent me a copy.
You might think that I could simply change "amsart" to "msripub"
in my own copy of the document,
but "msripub" is a proprietary format:
Levy keeps it to himself.
Eventually the scientific editors convinced Levy to send "msripub" to me.
I fed my document through "msripub" and admired the output.
</p><p>
Beautiful!
</p><p>
I returned to Lamport's article
and discovered that he allowed certain minor exceptions to his "illusion":
</p><blockquote>
Achieving the highest possible quality
requires the ability to make changes to the system's output.
This will be a matter of fine tuning,
changing such things as page breaks and figure placement. ...
[However:]
The changes will generally be of such a minor nature
that they are not worth bothering with
in a preliminary version intended for a small audience,
nor for any document that is not widely distributed.
...
I usually spend less than two minutes per page
doing the final formatting to produce camera-ready output.
This is insignificant compared with the two to eight hours per page I spend writing.
</blockquote>
"Highest possible quality" sounds desirable,
and "two minutes" sounds tolerably small,
so I decided to edit the "msripub" version of my document.
<p>
You might like to pause at this point to contemplate the goals of scientific publication.
Isn't it wonderful to see science propelled forward
by something as small and simple as the switch from "amsart" to "msripub"?
</p><p>
Back to the story.
After many, many, many hours of work I had a new version of the document:

I had changed more than 100 separate lines of the main text,
not to mention the introductory figures, the bibliography, etc.
Many of those lines were quite difficult to adjust:
eliminating one bad line break
often meant experimenting with several different wordings and inspecting the output of each.
"Two minutes" is, I regret to report, a rather severe underestimate.
Could it be that Levy had a different reason for doing nothing at all with this paper?
</p><p>
I spent a few more hours carefully checking the paper
against the old "amsart" version
to see whether any bugs had been introduced by this flood of changes.
I ended up fixing two obsolete cross-references and two typos.
And so, finally, the conversion from "amsart" to "msripub" came to an end.

<p>In 2017, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in neural machine translation by stacking only (self-)attention layers. Compared to recurrent neural networks, Transformer models exhibit efficient parallel processing of tokens, leading to better modeling of long-range correlations and, most importantly, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable scaling in terms of data and compute</a>. Since then, Transformers seem to have taken over natural language processing. Widespread adoption of attention-based architectures seems likely given recent work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale</a> and the flurry of developments addressing the architecture’s quadratic scaling bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Recently, the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> provided complementary post-facto explanations of some of the success of Transformers from the perspective of energy-based models. In this post, I provide a biased overview of (self-)attention in Transformers and summarize its connections to modern Hopfield networks. Along the way, I look for intuition from physics and indulge in hand-wavy arguments on how an energy-based perspective can shed light on training and improving Transformer models.</p>

<p>Let’s start off with an overview of the components in a vanilla Transformer model. Since our focus is on (self-)attention, I am going to assume some prior knowledge<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and skip comprehensive architecture descriptions and experimental results. In <a href="#3-from-hopfield-networks-to-transformers">Section 3</a>, we will start from scratch and use Hopfield networks to build back up to the attention module described below.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-transformers">Vanilla Transformers</h2>
<p>The proto-Transformer was introduced in an encoder-decoder context for machine translation in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a>. The original motivation seems to have been mostly driven by engineering efforts to model long-range correlations in sequence data and the recent successes of attention mechanisms stacked on top of recurrent neural networks. The main contribution and selling point of the paper was making an attention-only approach to sequence modeling work.</p>
<p><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/vanilla_transformer.png" alt="alt text" title="Vanilla Transformers encoder-decoder architecture"></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the encoder on the left and ignore the decoder on the right. Transformer models accept (batches of) sets of vectors, which covers most inputs people care about in machine learning. Text can be modelled as a sequence of embedded tokens. Images can be viewed as a snaky sequence of embedded pixels or embedded patches of pixels. Since sets have no notion of ordering, learned or fixed positional information needs to be explicitly added to the input vectors.</p>
<p>The main module in the Transformer encoder block is the multi-head <em>self-attention</em>, which is based on a (scaled) dot-product attention mechanism acting on a set of $d$-dimensional vectors:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Attention}\left( \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V} \right) = \mathrm{softmax} \left( \frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) \mathbf{V}
\label{eq:vanilla-attention}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Here, queries $\mathbf{Q}$, keys $\mathbf{K}$, and values $\mathbf{V}$ are matrices obtained from acting with different linear transformations — parametrized respectively by weights $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{Q}}$, $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{K}}$, and $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{V}}$ — on the same set of $d$-dimensional inputs. <em>Cross-attention</em> takes the inputs for its queries from a different source than for its keys and values, as can be glimpsed from the decoder part of the architecture on the right.</p>
<p>For every input query, the updated output query of \eqref{eq:vanilla-attention} is a linear combination of values weighted by an attention matrix quantifying the overlap of the input query with the keys corresponding to these values. Since all objects are vectors and the attention mechanism is just a dot product between vectors, we can think of the attention module as matching query vectors to their “closest” key vectors in latent space and summing up contributions from value vectors, weighted by the “closeness” of their keys to the queries.</p>
<p>The remaining components of the Transformer encoder block are needed to make the module work properly in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>multi-headedness</em> of the attention module refers to chunking up the dimension of the vector space and having multiple attention operations running in parallel in the same module, yet with each acting on a lower-dimensional segment of the full space. This is a trick to (1) get around the fact that every input vector only couples to one query at a time to calculate its attention coefficient, and (2) provide multiple starting points in the subspaces for the queries, which might help to avoid bad local minima in parameter space during optimization.</li>
<li>A positional feed-forward network, made up of two linear layers with a non-linearity in between, is inserted at the end of the module. Folklore wisdom tells us that the feed-forward layer needs to blow up the dimension of the latent space by a factor of four for it to be able to “disentangle” the represention. More likely though, it’s a way to increase model capacity and warp latent spaces since the attention modules on their own are pretty much linear apart from the $\mathrm{softmax}$-operator used to obtain the normalized attention coefficients.</li>
<li>Residual connections are added to control the flow of gradients.</li>
<li>Layer normalisation is used to control learning dynamics and keep vector norms from exploding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beyond-vanilla-confronting-quadratic-scaling">Beyond vanilla: confronting quadratic scaling</h2>
<p>Most architectural variations of the vanilla Transformer are targeted at the attention module, which scales poorly with respect to the input sequence length $N$. Since the overlap of all queries with all keys is required, calculating a dense attention matrix scales like $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in time and space. Limits on the context window of the attention mechanism during training prevent the model from learning how to deal with long sequences and long-range correlations. The majority of post-vanilla Transformer species can be classified into one of the following buckets<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-rank approximations: truncate the matrix product $\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T$ since it’s likely not full rank for structured data</li>
<li>Sparsification: reduce the attention calculation from all query-key pairs to a subset because not all of them feel the need to talk to each other</li>
<li>Recurrence: keep track of a (compressed) history of context</li>
<li>Kernels: approximate the attention operation with kernel methods</li>
</ul>
<p>For the remainder of our discussion, we will focus on vanilla Transformers. One of the goals of this blog post is to explore how a different perspective on the <em>function</em> of attention-based algorithms might lead to qualitatively different improvements beyond what is possible by relying on scaling and reducing computational complexity alone.</p>

<p>In this section, we provide a short history of Hopfield networks and gradually build up intuition until we can recognize the Transformer self-attention mechanism for what it really is. We refer to the <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> accompanying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> for more details and insightful visualizations of pattern storage and retrieval.</p>
<h2 id="classical-discrete-hopfield-networks">Classical discrete Hopfield networks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield network</a> is a simple model for associative memory popularized by John Hopfield in his 1982 paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Networks and Physical Systems with Emergent Collective Computational Abilities</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The task of an associative memory is to store and retrieve patterns, preferably in a way that allows one to recover stored patterns quickly with a low error rate.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the Hopfield network — and other energy-based models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boltzmann machines</a> — is to construct an <em>energy function</em> which defines an <em>energy landscape</em> containing basins of attraction around patterns we want to store. Starting at any pattern, we want to have an update rule pointing towards the closest stored pattern, guided by a scalar “closeness” score provided by the energy function.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/energy_landscape.png" alt="alt text" title="Toy energy landscape of a Hopfield Network"></a></p>
<p>Let’s make this a bit more formal but not too formal. Consider trying to store a set of $N$ binary patterns $\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector whose entries are either $-1$ or $1$. For example, in the case of storing black-and-white images, every image would correspond to a string of pixel values, a binary pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.</p>
<p>For any query $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, or <em>state pattern</em>, we want to find a way to retrieve the closest <em>stored pattern</em>. In his paper, Hopfield considered the energy function</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
E = - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{b} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_{ij} \xi_{i} \xi_{j} + \sum_{i=1}^{d} b_{i} \xi_{i} ,
\label{eq:ising}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>where $\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ denotes a bias vector and the weights $\boldsymbol{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are set to the sum of the outer products of the patterns we want to store</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{x}_{i} \otimes …</p></div></div>

<div><p><strong><br></strong>Facebook groups are a gold mine of clients for your agency or productized service.</p><p>In fact, this is how I found my first customers and <a href="https://manyrequests.com/blog/first-customers/">how many other agencies did too</a>.</p></div>







<p>Here are some reasons why I love Facebook groups so much:</p>



<h2>1. <strong>You can target your ideal clients.</strong></h2>



<div><p>The first reason why I like Facebook groups so much is that you can find a niche for practically any industry you’re in.</p><p>Unlike other communities which can be very noisy, a well moderated and niche Facebook group is an amazing opportunity to connect with your ideal clients.</p><p>Let’s take example.</p><p>Say you’re running a content writing service and one of your clients is SaaS companies. Just searching for SaaS companies gives you a ton of results:</p></div>

<h2>2. <strong>You can learn about your clients.</strong></h2>



<div><p>The second reason why I like Facebook groups is that you can learn more about your ideal clients and the problems they face.</p><p>For example, here’s a query I searched on “SaaS Growth Hacks” (a group of SaaS business owners).</p><p>Let’s say you want to learn more about the process of hiring freelance writers or getting content outsourced. Here’s a search example:</p></div>

<p>Other examples of queries could be:</p>



<ul><li>“<em>Looking for</em>” </li><li>“<em>Tools</em>” (to know what tools and software your target market use for exammple)</li></ul>



<h2><br>3. <strong>You can get fast results.</strong></h2>



<div><p>Finally, when you’re just starting, you need to have results.</p><p>Networking on Facebook groups doesn’t take a very long time and can yield quick results.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p></div>







<p>Here are 5 tips to network successfully on Facebook groups:</p>



<ul><li>Know your ideal clients</li><li>Join targeted Facebook groups</li><li>Create a benefits-driven posts</li><li>Optimize your Facebook profile</li><li>Focus on building relationships</li></ul>



<h2>#1 Know your ideal clients</h2>



<div><p>The first step of networking successfully on Facebook groups it to know your ideal customers.</p><p>When I started my productized service I asked myself: <strong>Who are my ideal customers?</strong></p><p>I looked at my existing customer base and came up with several customer profiles:</p></div>



<ul><li>Solo entrepreneurs / software founders</li><li>Marketers and content creators</li><li>Agency owners</li></ul>



<div><p>For each of them, I tried to get in their heads and see how my service could help them achieve their goals.</p><p>For example, I found out that Agency owners wanted a flexible way to hire staff without adding too much fixed costs, and solo entrepreneurs wanted a cost effective way to get work done. </p><p>I interviewed them, listened to the words they were using, and started building buyer personas.</p><p>If you haven’t build buyer personas, interviewing your customers (or potential customers) is a great way to get started.</p></div>



<h2><p>#2 Join niche Facebook groups</p></h2>



<div><p>Once you know your  ideal customers, it’s time to join Facebook groups.</p><p>Simply head to search on Facebook or use this <a href="https://www.targetsnake.com/">tool</a> that will list popular Facebook groups.</p></div>

<p>Once you’re in a Facebook group, make sure you check the rules and how it is moderated to play by the rules.</p>



<h2>#3 Create benefits-driven Facebook posts</h2>



<div><p>The key to win at networking on Facebook groups boils down to one thing: Value.</p><p>If you create valuable, benefits-driven posts, they will be accepted and the community will engage on these, with Facebook algorithm boosting their reach.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>1. Intro post</strong></p></div>



<div><p>Simply introduce yourself and what value you can bring to the community.</p><p>Here is a good example:</p></div>

<div><p>Some tips:</p><p>– Add a backstory <br>– Ask for feedback / review of your service<br>– You can also use it as an opportunity to ask for testers of your service in exchange for case studies if you’re launching</p></div>



<h2>#4 Optimize your profile for conversions</h2>



<div><p>Next step: Optimize your Facebook profile:</p><p>You can:</p></div>



<ul><li>Create a custom cover photo</li><li>Add a feature image</li><li>Add a tagline on your profile and profile picture</li></ul>



<div><p>If you have a Facebook group, a newsletter, or an ebook you can also add it in your profile. The key is to communicate what you do and get people to engage with you.</p><p>Here’s an example from Arrigo from <a href="https://www.koalarank.com/">Koala Rank</a>, a content writing service:</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>“Most of all, there is this truth: No matter how great your teachers may be, and no matter how esteemed your academy’s reputation, eventually you will have to do the work by yourself. Eventually, the teachers won’t be there anymore. The walls of the school will fall away, and you’ll be on your own.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/2TtGVsm">Elizabeth Gilbert, Big Magic</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very intentional about cultivating peers and mentors who I trust. When I <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left my job to start a business</a> earlier this year, one of the first things I did was create a list of informal advisors - mostly experienced entrepreneurs who I could count on for candid feedback.</p>
<p>Still, when I meet with one of my mentors to ask them a specific question, I start the conversation with a warning:</p>
<p>“I have a question, but just so you know, you’re not the only person I’m asking. If I don’t take your advice, I don’t want you to take it personally, okay?”</p>
<p>Every one of them appreciates this caveat because <strong>giving advice is really hard.</strong> In fact, I am starting to realize that you should be wary of people who are too quick to offer it.</p>
<p>The further I go in my career, the more skeptical I am of “experts.” While people with experience may generally make better decisions, I don’t know if their advice transfers the way they think it does.</p>
<p>Now, I realize the irony in offering advice to ignore advice, but my goal is to make you reconsider all advice - including the advice I give.</p>
<p>Above all, I hope this makes you think before you blindly follow others.</p>
<h2 id="1-experts-overgeneralize-their-experience">1. Experts Overgeneralize Their Experience</h2>
<p>Many legitimately successful people got lucky once.</p>
<p>You see this a lot in Silicon Valley-style businesses where a single expert or lucky investment might lead to generational wealth. These successful and wealthy people feel that they’ve discovered the “secret” to building a business based on a single runaway success.</p>
<p>This bias is called <a href="http://iameduard.com/overgeneralization/">overgeneralization</a>, and both advice givers and receivers fall into it.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve read <a href="https://amzn.to/3oy8DSY">Walter Isaacson’s biography</a>, you know that Steve Jobs was a ruthless boss and obsessive about details. Jobs was amazingly successful as an entrepreneur and executive; therefore, you should be ruthless and obsessive if you want to be a successful entrepreneur and executive.</p>
<p>The logical fallacy here is obvious - we can point to dozens of counterpoints - but it illustrates the danger in overgeneralizing an expert’s advice or behavior.</p>
<p>Part of the reason we fall prey to experts who overgeneralize their experience is that as humans, <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">we really like stories</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to <strong>understanding complex data and variation across a continuum</strong>. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuel cites Jeanne Calment, who lived to 116 years old and smoked every day of her adult life. Jeanne Calment is one data point. <strong>What worked for one person one time many years ago will not work for everyone for all time.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11C9E1C44BCB40F0FE12CD8C443C12B2DA5D48417F2028A6D847E5BE71580EB1_1603765436506_ovg.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Additionally, many experts <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1284104244891721730">rewrite their stories in their minds</a>.</p>
<p>Take Brian Williams, once an upstanding NBC news anchor and respected journalist. He told a complete fabrication of his experience in Iraq multiple times, including in an especially vivid recounting at a hockey game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7987439/brian-williams-iraq-apology-helicopter">Brian Williams</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if Williams knew he was lying or not, but if you want to believe his apology, he mistakenly inserted himself into a true story that he had seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area — and the fog of memory over 12 years — made me conflate the two.” - Brian Williams (later apologizing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the details of Williams’ story, it’s easy to imagine that most professionals with 10+ years of experience will misremember or rewrite parts of their own experience when asked. This problem gets compounded when beginners ask for advice from experts because they can’t discern the misremembering from the truth.</p>
<p>Beginners don’t have enough experience to call bullsh** on experts.</p>
<h2 id="2-inherent-survivorship-bias">2. Inherent Survivorship Bias</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The Misconception:</strong> You should focus on the successful if you wish to become successful.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> When failure becomes invisible, the difference between failure and success may also become invisible.” - <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/">David McRaney</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Survivors become experts</strong>, regardless of their skills, knowledge, or the repeatability of their experience.</p>
<p>Survivorship bias is one of the most dangerous ones in finance, and it’s one of the easiest traps to fall into when you look for advice. By taking only the positive cases (i.e.: people who succeeded in your field), you are unable to tell which factors were vital to their success and which factors were unrelated to it.</p>
<p>You hear the same thing from people who claim, “they sure don’t make ‘em like they used to.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A commonly held opinion in many populations is that machinery, equipment, and goods manufactured in previous generations often is better built and lasts longer…because of the selective pressures of time and use, it is inevitable that only those items that were built to last will have survived into the present day.</p>
<p>Therefore, most of the old machinery still seen functioning well in the present day must necessarily have been built to a standard of quality necessary to survive. All of the machinery, equipment, and goods that have failed over the intervening years are no longer visible to the general population as they have been junked, scrapped, recycled, or otherwise disposed of.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Wikipedia, Survivorship Bias</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11C9E1C44BCB40F0FE12CD8C443C12B2DA5D48417F2028A6D847E5BE71580EB1_1603765755896_survivor.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When survivors give advice, they conflate correlation and causation. Was the fact that <a href="https://tim.blog/about/">Tim Ferriss</a> executed his book launch a certain way the reason it succeeded? Or was the fact that Tim Ferriss had a massive audience of followers before his latest book launch the real reason?</p>
<p>We can’t know <a href="https://pjrvs.com/survivorship">because Tim Ferriss is a survivor</a>. He is one of the few authors who has “made it” to the level he has. By virtue of surviving this far, we have to take all of his marketing advice with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The danger of survivorship bias is that it’s tough to combat. People <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/want-to-really-help-others-talk-about-your-failures-not-successes.html">don’t like to talk about their failures</a>, and failures are subject to the same overgeneralization biases that successes are. In other words, <strong>even if someone tells you why they think they failed, they’re probably wrong.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-the-expert-beginner-experience-gulf">3. The Expert-Beginner Experience Gulf</h2>
<p>Knowledge isn’t discrete - it’s a continuum.</p>
<p>Experts tend to forget that they have a considerable base of knowledge that beginners lack. This experience gap means that realizations the expert recently had will be useless (or even harmful) to beginners who lack the same foundational understanding.</p>
<p>For example, a friend of mine recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and asked me what podcasts I listen to.</p>
<p>I thought about it for a while. Are the software architecture and management podcasts I listen to going to help this guy? There weren’t many programming podcasts around when I learned to code, so I can’t tell him which ones helped me when I was just starting out. Should I selfishly send him the podcast that recently invited me on as a guest?</p>
<p>I struggle with advising new programmers because the gulf between my current level of experience and theirs is too broad. I don’t remember what I didn’t know when I was just starting out; plus, the world has changed. The books I read back then are hopelessly out of date, and the books I read now are hopelessly indecipherable to most new programmers.</p>
<p>This chart illustrates the problem. When you’re just starting to learn about a topic, you start in the bottom-left, and over time you move to the top right:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zxD9C4I.png" alt="Knowledge contimuum"></p>
<p>Beginners need to grasp relationships and patterns, while experts are interested in uncovering principles. The advice experts give often comes from their higher-level understanding.</p>
<p>What’s more insidious about the expert-beginner gulf is that people’s brains actually <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/"><em>shut down</em> when given advice from an expert</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When thinking for themselves, students showed activity in their anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — brain regions associated with making decisions and calculating probabilities. When given advice from Noussair, activity in those regions flat lined. - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/">Brandon Keim, Wired</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the advice makes sense given the expert’s current level of understanding, the beginner may not grasp the underlying patterns required to make good use of the advice.</p>
<p>For example, we typically tell new drivers to stop at red lights. This is good generalized advice, but a beginner may not realize that there exceptions to this rule. What if the light is flashing red? What if it’s red, but no traffic is coming, and you want to turn right? What if you have a medical emergency?</p>
<p>Experienced drivers can make judgment calls based on advice and experience, but beginners cannot. They haven’t developed the filters to process and individualize advice.</p>
<h2 id="4-they-might-be-charlatans">4. They Might Be Charlatans</h2>
<p>It’s hard to believe I’ve gotten this far without mentioning experts who are blatantly slanting their advice towards profit, but I’ll get to it now.</p>
<p>First, what is a <em>charlatan?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A person who pretends or claims to have more knowledge or skill than he or she possesses; quack.” - <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/charlatan">Dictionary.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, most online courses are sold by charlatans. I’m not saying you can’t learn anything from them, but most people selling them don’t have much more knowledge than you do; they just offer their advice more confidently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We now live in a time where information is becoming less and less commoditized and learning is becoming freer by passing days. So, it’s surprising that institutes and “experts” still exist and charge big money for courses.” - <a href="https://thatnameasif.medium.com/digital-marketing-courses-scam-be96464c12e2">Asif Ali</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, most charlatans don’t even know …</p></div></article></section></div>

</p><p><b>The Webless Initiative</b> is a campaign to make the modern Web a more
livable place. We aim to accomplish this by:
</p><ul>
	<li>Discouraging useless "style" or "interactive" features
	</li><li>Encouraging fast, portable, readable pages, with simpler HTML
</li></ul>
<p>This should:
</p><ul>
	<li>Make web browsers potentially a lot smaller, faster and comfortable<br>
	(realistically, make it possible to use existing small web browsers)
	</li><li>Drastically lessen the necessary bandwidth, making more room for real content
</li></ul>
<p>We plan to provide a set of rules and recommendations for anyone who wishes
to make their web page conformant. There will be an automatic validator for this
ruleset.
</p><p>We plan to create and maintain <b>two lists of websites</b>, with an appropriate
label or banner site owners can publish to indicate their membership:
</p><ul>
<li><b><a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/friends.html">Friends of Webless</a></b>
<p>
Simply by expressing their wish, anyone can be part of this list. The only
condition is that their site is <b>comfortably usable with a small web browser</b>.
</p><p>This might be manually checked, and Webless might refuse to keep the site listed,
if we perceive that it does not meet <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-friends.html">this rule</a>.

</p></li><li><b>Validated Webless</b>
<p>
Membership on this list is per request. The site will be checked
(and may be periodically rechecked) against the <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-validated.html">Webless Rules.</a>
Only sites passing these tests will be listed.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
We ask that listed (friends and validated) sites place a link on this page.
This is not mandatory; and the link might serve as a disclaimer for when
visitors are asking why your page is lacking all the modern whizbang.

<div><div>




<div><p>In January 2014, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Udacity, and AT&amp;T paired up to launch their first approved Master of Science in Computer Science from an accredited university where students can exclusively earn residential programs through a large online platform at a lower price.</p></div>
</div></div>



<p>The whole initiative formally referred to as “OMSCS” links education, MOOCs, and industry leaders to apply the transformative force of technology to broaden the pool of high-quality trained talent needed in the fields of computer science.</p>



<p><strong><em>The program was described by Zvi Galil, dean of computing at Georgia Tech, as a “The massive, incompetent success has already had a huge effect on the landscape of graduate education in computer science”</em></strong></p>



<p>While the university has not achieved its ambitious target of enrolling 10,000 students in three years, enrollment grew from 380 students in spring 2014 to 9,000 this spring, currently the largest master’s degree program in computer science in the United States.</p>



<p>During the annual U.S News &amp; World Report rankings, Georgia Tech graduate programs are consistently in the top 10 and are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).</p>



<h3>A peek at Georgia Tech University’s Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program:</h3>



<p>A 30 credit hours-10 course program is offered by the Online Masters of Science in Computer Science(OMSCS). Four specializations that can be completed within two-three years are offered in this curriculum. OMSCS’s growth was phenomenal, with OMSCS offering a total of 30 courses to 8,662 students in four specializations by the Spring 2019 term.</p>



<p>Georgia Tech has an exceptional admission policy, as the program does not require GRE. Instead in specific courses, students have to obtain a grade B or greater.</p>



<p>Tuition per credit for OMSCS is $180 per credit hour and the additional cost of $301 per semester of technology fees and institutional fees is added to the estimated cost. The cost of the program is around $5,400, where students can finish school from the OMSCS program with a total cost of less than $7000 for students who want to pursue OMSCS.</p>



<p>The application deadline to apply for OMSCS at Georgia Institute of Technology is 1st March 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>“OMSCS has succeeded beyond our imagination. Our excellence centered on the professors, which largely accepted OMSCS and then passionately conducted the program,” Zvi Galil stated.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Galil also said that “OMSCS progress encouraged Georgia Tech to introduce two additional degrees (on edX). With 250 students, the OMS Analytics degree started in fall 2017; the enrollment this semester is 1,500. With about 250 students, the OMS Cybersecurity degree was implemented in January”.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How much is the tuition for University of Georgia Online Masters in computer science in 2020?</h3>



<p><strong><span>Students can still get a complete a master’s degree at Georgia Tech University for the Online Masters of Science in Computer Science for the academic year 2020-2021 at a total tuition cost of around $7000.</span></strong></p>

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

		<p><strong>Authors:&nbsp; Ulrich Schimmack, Moritz Heene, and Kamini Kesavan</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
We computed the R-Index for studies cited in Chapter 4 of Kahneman’s book “Thinking Fast and Slow.” This chapter focuses on priming studies, starting with John Bargh’s study that led to Kahneman’s open email.&nbsp; The results are eye-opening and jaw-dropping.&nbsp; The chapter cites 12 articles and 11 of the 12 articles have an R-Index below 50.&nbsp; The combined analysis of 31 studies reported in the 12 articles shows 100% significant results with average (median) observed power of 57% and an inflation rate of 43%.&nbsp; The R-Index is 14. This result confirms Kahneman’s prediction that priming research is a train wreck and readers of his book “Thinking Fast and Slow” should not consider the presented studies as scientific evidence that subtle cues in their environment can have strong effects on their behavior outside their awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman published a popular book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Thinking Fast and Slow”</a>, about important finding in social psychology.</p>
<p>In the same year, questions about the trustworthiness of social psychology were raised.&nbsp; A Dutch social psychologist had fabricated data. Eventually over 50 of his articles would be retracted.&nbsp; Another social psychologist published results that appeared to demonstrate the ability to foresee random future events (Bem, 2011). Few researchers believed these results and statistical analysis suggested that the results were not trustworthy (Francis, 2012; Schimmack, 2012).&nbsp; Psychologists started to openly question the credibility of published results.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2012, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029081">Doyen and colleagues</a> published a failure to replicate a prominent study by John Bargh that was featured in Daniel Kahneman’s book.&nbsp; A few month later, Daniel Kahneman distanced himself from Bargh’s research in an <a href="http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2012/10/05/kahneman-on-the-storm-of-doubts-surrounding-social-priming-research/">open email</a> addressed to John Bargh (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535">Young, 2012</a>):</p>
<p>“As all of you know, of course, questions have been raised about the robustness of priming results…. your field is now the poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research… people have now attached a question mark to the field, and it is your responsibility to remove it… all I have personally at stake is that I recently wrote a book that emphasizes priming research as a new approach to the study of associative memory…Count me as a general believer… My reason for writing this letter is that I see a train wreck looming.”</p>
<p>Five years later, Kahneman’s concerns have been largely confirmed. Major studies in social priming research have failed to replicate and the replicability of results in social psychology is estimated to be only 25% (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248">OSC, 2015</a>).</p>
<p>Looking back, it is difficult to understand the uncritical acceptance of social priming as a fact.&nbsp; In “Thinking Fast and Slow” Kahneman wrote “disbelief is not an option. The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true.”</p>
<p>Yet, Kahneman could have seen the train wreck coming. In 1971, he co-authored an article about scientists’ “exaggerated confidence in the validity of conclusions based on small samples” (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971, p. 105).&nbsp; Yet, many of the studies described in Kahneman’s book had small samples.&nbsp; For example, Bargh’s priming study used only 30 undergraduate students to demonstrate the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Replicability Index</strong></p>
<p>Small samples can be sufficient to detect large effects. However, small effects require large samples.&nbsp; The probability of replicating a published finding is a function of sample size and effect size.&nbsp; The Replicability Index (<a href="https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/a-revised-introduction-to-the-r-index/">R-Index</a>) makes it possible to use information from published results to predict how replicable published results are.</p>
<p>Every reported test-statistic can be converted into an estimate of power, called observed power. For a single study, this estimate is useless because it is not very precise. However, for sets of studies, the estimate becomes more precise. &nbsp;If we have 10 studies and the average power is 55%, we would expect approximately 5 to 6 studies with significant results and 4 to 5 studies with non-significant results.</p>
<p>If we observe 100% significant results with an average power of 55%, it is likely that studies with non-significant results are missing (Schimmack, 2012).&nbsp; There are too many significant results.&nbsp; This is especially true because average power is also inflated when researchers report only significant results. Consequently, the true power is even lower than average observed power.&nbsp; If we observe 100% significant results with 55% average powered power, power is likely to be less than 50%.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable. Tversky and Kahneman (1971) wrote “we refuse to believe that a serious investigator will knowingly accept a .50 risk of failing to confirm a valid research hypothesis.”</p>
<p>To correct for the inflation in power, the R-Index uses the inflation rate. For example, if all studies are significant and average power is 75%, the inflation rate is 25% points. &nbsp;The R-Index subtracts the inflation rate from average power.&nbsp; So, with 100% significant results and average observed power of 75%, the R-Index is 50% (75% – 25% = 50%).&nbsp; The R-Index is not a direct estimate of true power. It is actually a conservative estimate of true power if the R-Index is below 50%.&nbsp; Thus, an R-Index below 50% suggests that a significant result was obtained only by capitalizing on chance, although it is difficult to quantify by how much.</p>
<p><strong>How Replicable are the Social Priming Studies in “Thinking Fast and Slow”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: The Associative Machine</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1.&nbsp; Cognitive priming effect</strong></p>
<p>In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked.</p>
<p>[no reference provided]</p>
<p><strong>4.2.&nbsp; Priming of behavior without awareness </strong></p>
<p>Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words. You cannot know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.</p>
<p>“In an experiment that became an instant classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at New York University—most aged eighteen to twenty-two—to assemble four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other.”</p>
<p>“As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others. walking slowly, which is associated with old age.”</p>
<p>“All this happens without any awareness. When they were questioned afterward, none of the students reported noticing that the words had had a common theme, and they all insisted that nothing they did after the first experiment could have been influenced by the words they had encountered. The idea of old age had not come to their conscious awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless.“</p>

<p><strong>4.3. &nbsp;Reversed priming: Behavior primes cognitions</strong></p>
<p>“The ideomotor link also works in reverse. A study conducted in a German university was the mirror image of the early experiment that Bargh and his colleagues had carried out in New York.”</p>
<p>“Students were asked to walk around a room for 5 minutes at a rate of 30 steps per minute, which was about one-third their normal pace. After this brief experience, the participants were much quicker to recognize words related to old age, such as forgetful, old, and lonely.”</p>
<p>“Reciprocal priming effects tend to produce a coherent reaction: if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age.”</p>

<p><strong>4.4.&nbsp; Facial-feedback hypothesis (smiling makes you happy)</strong></p>
<p>“Reciprocal links are common in the associative network. For example, being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you feel amused….”</p>
<p>“College students were asked to rate the humor of cartoons from Gary Larson’s The Far Side while holding a pencil in their mouth. Those who were “smiling” (without any awareness of doing so) found the cartoons funnier than did those who were “frowning.”</p>
<p>[“Inhibiting and Facilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial Feedback Hypothesis,” <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology </em>54 (1988): 768–77.]</p>
<p>The authors used the more liberal and unconventional criterion of p &lt; .05 (one-tailed), z = 1.65, as a criterion for significance. Accordingly, we adjusted the R-Index analysis and used 1.65 as the criterion value.</p>

It's supposed to give them a good quality, high-speed internet connection, but it's not cheap and some say the low-orbit Starlink satellites are ruining their view of the night sky.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:06</span></span></span></p><p><span><p>When Vernon Kejick got a first taste of Starlink satellite internet on the Pikangikum First Nation, his initial review was succinct.</p>  <p>"All I can say is it's a lot faster than what I had before," he said. Kejick's response highlights a long-running disparity that may finally have met a resolution.</p>  <p>Starlink, the new high-speed internet service provided by Elon Musk's U.S.-based SpaceX firm, and recently <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/elon-musk-tesla-starlink-low-earth-orbit-high-speed-rural-internet-rockets-satellite-1.5768338"><u>approved</u></a> by the CRTC, does have drawbacks. It's expensive. And stargazers fear it will ruin the night sky.</p>  <p>But for users in rural and remote areas who've long struggled to obtain internet access on equal footing with Canadians in urban areas, Starlink is offering hope. The service was recently made available to select users for "beta testing," with the promise of wider availability in 2021.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, a fly-in community of 2,800 residents in northwest Ontario, Kejick said he'd become accustomed to download speeds of only 2 megabits per second —&nbsp;a fraction of the 50 megabits per the second the federal government considers a standard minimum for broadband.</p>    <p>At work, Kejick couldn't open large email attachments. He described the service as "deplorable."</p>  <p>At the end of November, Pikangikum became the first Indigenous community to get connected to Starlink, with 60 dishes reserved for homes and businesses in the community in the initial phase of installation, and potentially another 40 by the end of December.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Elon Musk's SpaceX firm has promised Starlink internet will provide 'near global coverage of the populated world' in 2021.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Hannibal Hanschke/Pool via REUTERS)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Now, Kejick said his devices have been reaching 144 megabits per second. Not only can he quickly download attachments, Kejick said his wife has finally been able to chat with relatives in the Philippines over FaceTime.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's as if you're sitting in the same room," he said.</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, however, Starlink could offer more fundamental changes. Kejick, a victim services advocate with the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, said he hopes victims of crime will&nbsp;now be able to testify virtually, lessening the burden on them.</p>  <p>Members of the remote Ojibwe community hope the faster internet will remove barriers to access virtual healthcare services and education, too.</p>    <p>"It's doing everything that people are asking it to do," said David Brown, CEO of FSET Information Technology in Kenora, Ont. His firm had been working with Pikangikum for several years to try to improve their connectivity.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When he heard about Starlink, Brown jokingly promised his staff he would directly contact SpaceX's Musk —&nbsp;who recently surpassed Microsoft founder Bill Gates as one of the world's richest people, second only to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/spacex-starlink.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/spacex-starlink.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/spacex-starlink.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/spacex-starlink.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A SpaceX craft launches a cluster of 60 Starlink satellites.

FSET recently helped install the first batch. And the result, Brown said, was better than he expected.</p>  <p>Starlink is "a wonderful thing," he said. "It's going to change the world for people."</p>  <h2>Rural, remote areas lack broadband</h2>  <p>Across Canada, only 40.8 per cent of rural communities have access to adequate broadband, according to federal <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/internet/internet.htm"><u>data</u></a>.</p>  <p>Greg Rekounas, a database administrator who has long worked from home, said he contacted various service providers and could never find suitable broadband for his house on New Brunswick's Kingston Peninsula, near Saint John.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/greg-rekounas.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/greg-rekounas.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/greg-rekounas.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greg-rekounas.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/greg-rekounas.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5818012.1606424644!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/greg-rekounas.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Greg Rekounas tests download and upload speeds via his newly installed link to Starlink low earth orbit satellites. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Greg Rekounas, submitted)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>The quality of his home connection suffered under the strain of increased streaming and surfing during the pandemic. So when he heard about Starlink, he signed up in November to become one of the company's Canadian beta testers. Rekounas received an email saying he'd been selected, and received the installation kit within days.</p>  <p>"I've been waiting for something like this for a long time," he said. There have been some hiccups with certain streaming apps, but Rekounas said "in general, it's been fantastic."</p>  <p>SpaceX said&nbsp;there are bound to be interruptions while its service is in beta testing, which it describes as "Better Than Nothing Beta."</p>  <p>Not everyone who registers to become a tester is selected to take part. SpaceX did not respond to emailed questions about the number of Canadians testing its service, or when exactly the firm expects to make Starlink available to the general public.</p>  <p>The cost alone is bound to turn off some consumers. Delores Waye of Taymouth, N.B., north of Fredericton, recently received an invitation from Starlink after her son had made the request. She was interested in signing up, until Waye saw the price at the bottom of the email.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;Starlink satellites spotted over New Brunswick:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Starlink satellites spotted over New Brunswick" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1828820035953-metadata-" title="Starlink satellites spotted over New Brunswick"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/227/715/1-STARLINK-OVER-FREDERICTON.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Michael Stemm captured low orbit SpaceX Starlink satellites over Fredericton on the evening of June 4, 2020.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:51</span></span></span></p>  <p>Buying the dish and other gear needed for the Starlink service costs $649, plus tax. Rekounas said he paid $820 in total. Users are expected to install the kit themselves. Then, it's $129 per month for the service.</p>  <p>"I was floored," Waye&nbsp;said. "When you're doing beta testing, you would expect the company to at least provide you with the equipment. It just seems crazy."</p>  <h2>Trouble above</h2>  <p>There's also another kind of cost to consider: the lasting impact of thousands of low Earth orbit satellites sent into the sky. Starlink satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of 550 kilometres. That's thousands of kilometres lower than conventional satellites — reducing&nbsp;the distance the signal must travel.&nbsp;</p>  <p>SpaceX has been launching up to 60 satellites at a time, with hundreds already in orbit.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>It is especially easy at the beginning of a new year to fall into the trap of the <em>New Year's Resolution</em>. New goals and challenges and routines are established under the banner of <em>self-improvement</em>. Gyms and fitness centers become packed. Productivity books fly off the shelves. In the words of <em>The New Yorker's</em> Alexandria Schwarts, we're <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/improving-ourselves-to-death">improving ourselves to death</a> and in our crusade to make time for all this self-improvement, hobbies are too often forgotten.</p>
<blockquote>
What I've discovered over time is that many of my skills and passions have developed only through little side-projects that never see the light of day.
</blockquote>

<p>For me, hobbies walk an enjoyable line between work and play: I often aim to learn something or try something new. Hobbies afford me the opportunity to challenge myself and embrace failure without worry of repercussion. A couple years ago, during a self-imposed redesign of this blog, I came across Robert Bringhurst's fantastic book, <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/books/the_elements_of_typographic_style">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>. Captured by his prose on the art of typography and font design, I started exploring and my website became an outlet for <a href="http://www.cachestocaches.com/2017/9/clear-visual-design-web/">experiments in typography</a>. My exploration grew to include other types of graphic design, and I've been experimenting with design software and creating vector art ever since.
Mastery has never been the goal: learning something new and having an outlet for my creativity are their own rewards. But despite the independent nature of my exploration, making high-quality graphs and figures became easier and the quality of my technical presentations at work has clearly improved.</p>

<p>My foray into design is far from the only instance of this, and many of my hobbies have even shaped my career. <span>In the preface to his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Dog-Saw-Other-Adventures/dp/0316076201">What The Dog Saw</a>, Malcolm Gladwell reflects "…it took me forever to realize that writing could be a <em>job</em>. Jobs were things that were serious and daunting. Writing was fun." </span>In college, my penchant for translating my physics homework into computer code landed me a job as an undergraduate researcher. Many of my colleagues have similar stories: their <em>fun little projects</em> would start to occupy more and more of their time until it would make its way into their work or somehow start shape the way they thought about a problem. For most of my hobby projects — even those tangentially related to my work — I rarely feel as if I am building skills that I'll ever use again. And yet, time and again, I have found a strange usefulness out of them: perhaps a colleague wanted to know if anyone had used an obscure programming library or get recommendations on some software for <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, or <code>Z</code>.
</p><p>In the preface to his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Dog-Saw-Other-Adventures/dp/0316076201">What The Dog Saw</a>, Malcolm Gladwell reflects "…it took me forever to realize that writing could be a <em>job</em>. Jobs were things that were serious and daunting. Writing was fun." </p>
<p>I'm not advocating that we should all take up new hobbies with the sole intention of developing skills useful for our careers — lest "hobbying" become a new class of New Year's Resolution. To be clear, for every hobby project of mine that has had a clear positive impact <em>in the wild</em> there have been another five or ten that yielded no extrinsic rewards (so far). But the combination of the satisfaction I get from freely exploring a new idea and the occasional long-term reward make me feel as if I am constantly growing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-mundanity-of-excellence-an-ethnographic-report-on-stratification-and-olympic-swimmers#email-newsletter">The Mundanity of Excellence</a>, Daniel F. Chambliss argues that "excellence is a compound effect of mundane actions". My hobbies are nothing if not mundane, but — as I strive towards excellence — I can't help but notice that they've shaped my mental models and how I approach new problems at work. My most recent project involves playing around with <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, the open source 3D modeling and rendering software. I have no idea if any of this will yield any skills that prove useful to my career someday.</p>
<p>But, of course, that's the point.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome your thoughts (and personal anecdotes) in the comments below or on Hacker News.</p>

But when initial work was completed, I had to face the facts: I needed to setup a JavaScript bundler.</p><p>Webpack is familiar. But I scan a number of other React libraries, and none of them are using Webpack. Is that because it's unfashionable or unfit? You can never tell with JavaScript.</p><p>So I decide on Rollup. Rollup uses a plugin system. Even though my setup feels very standard, it's unclear what precise combination of plugins I'll need to get this to work. A brute-force Google-Copy-Paste-Rebundle-Refresh-Delete-Repeat loop ensues.</p><p>Eventually, I discover it's not just about the combination of plugins - plugin <em>order</em> matters. That's because, taking a peek under the hood, it would appear that Unspeakable Things are happening. I regret peeking. Close the hood.</p><p>Here's the thing: <em>No one is at fault</em> here.</p><p>JavaScript is everything that is beautiful and frustrating about humanity. It is the people's language, yet not one we ever democratically elected. As with much of web technology, it evolved as a series of kludges, grand plans be damned. We <a href="https://dart.dev/">tried</a> <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">to</a> <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">stop</a> <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">it</a>, but this was swimming the Colorado river upstream.</p><p>Maybe we should have paddled harder.</p><p>It is only in JavaScript that we can find ourselves staring down <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991">this massive thread</a>, the issue colloquially referred to as Issue One-Three-Nine-Nine-One:</p><p><img src="https://acco.io/bundler-wars/the-thread.png" alt="The Thread" height="300"></p><p>In my new role as React Library Author, I have become quite familiar with Issue One-Three-Nine-Nine-One. I return to this thread so frequently, I'm afraid GitHub is going to throttle me for abuse.</p><p>The issue contains <del>242</del> 287 comments (and counting). Many comments are littered desperately with emojis, like ancient cairns marking solutions as either roads to prosperity or roads to doom.</p><p>Issue One-Three-Nine-Nine-One isn't working towards a solution. It's providing a marketplace, an open Bazaar where Finders from afar can peddle their solutions - and Seekers can desperately Copy-Paste-Rebundle-Refresh - <em>no, that wasn't it either.</em></p><p><img src="https://acco.io/bundler-wars/bazaar.jpg" alt="Ancient Bazaar" height="400"></p><blockquote><p><em>Solutions for webpack! Get ye solutions for webpack!</em></p><p><em>Here lies the command ye seek! It uses an obscure tandem of <code>npm-link-shared</code> and <code>prestart</code> hooks. Don't ask questions, yer fine!</em></p><p><em>This 30-minute blog post will ward off Double-React Syndrome for good!</em></p></blockquote><p>I feel like I've tried every solution, every salve. I feel hopeless, despondent.</p><p>@apieceofbart goes so far as to (very kindly) suggest:</p><blockquote><p>"It was obviously my mistake of using two copies of React but I agree that it would be great if the error message was better."</p></blockquote><p>No, @apieceofbart, this is not your fault. It's not React's fault. It's not ECMA's fault or Eich's fault.</p><p>This is our fault. JavaScript is our problem.</p><p>I get it working. How? I'm not totally sure. While my initial steps were measured, I quickly deteriorated into a debug frenzy. Copying and pasting lines from blog posts found on page 5 of a Google Search. Swapping out bundlers - just to swap them back in. <code>rm -f</code>'ing <code>node_modules</code> so many times, I was certain that those blocks of my SSD were going to go permanently dark.</p><p>My solution is far from optimal. I have a separate repo for testing my library, but I can't get <code>npm link</code> to work. But if, with each change to my library, I (1) bump the version, (2) bundle it, (3) push it to npm, (4) bump the version in my test repo, (5) <code>yarn install</code> -- my app compiles and I can test my library.</p><p>This is not sustainable. But I guess it <em>is</em> JavaScript, after all.</p><p>I feel dejected. I have a solution, but it's unfulfilling. I feel like a cheat, a fraud, a copypasta programmer who doesn't understand the duplo blocks he's piecing together. What craftsman remains so perplexed by his tools after over a decade of experience?</p><p>A tool is supposed to <em>feel good</em> - sturdy, predictable, precise. A tool is supposed to make its wielder <em>feel powerful</em>. JavaScript and its maddening toolchain, from beginning to end, will find little ways to undermine you. To humiliate you.</p><p>As someone that has programmed JavaScript professionally since 2013, I am convinced we are under a collective delusion. This is what Stockholm Syndrome feels like on the inside.</p><hr><p><em>December 2020</em>: I broke free this year, at least partially. After years of Node back-ends, I switched to Elixir/Phoenix.</p><p>I've been on Elixir/Phoenix for 6+ months now, and yet the stack still makes me smile at least once per day. It is such a pleasure to have a thoughtful, well-designed, integrated developer experience from end-to-end.</p><p>I feel like a craftsman reunited with his tools again. With JavaScript relegated to just the front-end, I feel at peace.</p><p>Remember, dear reader, that you <em>do</em> have a choice.</p><hr><div><p><img height="50" src="https://acco.io/sync-inc-logo.svg" alt="Sync Inc Logo"></p><p>We're in the earliest of days building <a href="https://syncinc.so/">Sync Inc</a>.

			<p>“ICS cybersecurity? What’s that? Is it worth doing? Can it be done? No it cannot, I heard…Even if you did the market isn’t large enough to support it long term”</p>
<p>Dragos, Inc.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201208005280/en/Dragos-Announces-Record-Setting-110M-Investment-in-Industrial-Cybersecurity-with-Series-C-Funding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced today its C-Series financing</a>&nbsp;which is the largest investment ever into an industrial control system (ICS) / operational technology (OT) cybersecurity company. The investment is $110M for a total raised of more than $158M over the four years the company has been around. As the co-founder and CEO it fills me with great pride because of the team Dragos has assembled and our amazing customers who have truly partnered with us on our collective journey. Seeing them leverage our technology, services, and intelligence to make their companies more secure and further their maturity is something amazing to behold. Most citizens never understand or gain insight into how hard their infrastructure companies work to provide safe and reliable services and goods; I can tell you first hand this community works amazingly hard. There’s a lot of unknown passionate professionals running proof of concepts, implementing projects, advocating internal to their org, getting trained, working long hours, etc. all to allow companies like Dragos to exist to serve this community. Thank you.</p>

In this post I want to walk through some of the challenges I’ve faced for Dragos from an investment perspective and the path along the way explicitly to help explain what I think this investment means for the broader OT/ICS cybersecurity market and community. I’ll speak a lot about our journey so far but the point isn’t about Dragos’ financing but instead the amazing realization that OT cybersecurity is worth doing, a large enough market to do it in, and that it can be done.</p>
<p>I will say without any intent to hype it up that I do believe this is a watershed moment and I hope to share that perspective with you.</p>
<p><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQE2hi-NmAf30A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1607358704230?e=1613001600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=1esWaEXl6ipzr5O1sm-1ZmyZO1C3wkX8qJGPdNbIrzY" alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQE2hi-NmAf30A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1607358704230?e=1613001600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=1esWaEXl6ipzr5O1sm-1ZmyZO1C3wkX8qJGPdNbIrzY"></p>
<p>I started Dragos a little over four years ago with my co-founders Jon Lavender and Justin Cavinee who had worked with me at the National Security Agency on our mission of identifying and responding to threats to ICS worldwide. We started the company not out of the desire to create a company or technology. To be candid we all abhorred the idea of becoming a software vendor after a career of being practitioners and community members in this space. But we did so out of a stark realization that the industry was changing and the threats were becoming more numerous and aggressive. What we were seeing as “answers” were a copy/pasting of IT security best practices into the ICS networks with little regard for the unique mission and threats those systems faced. I had authored the SANS ICS515 class on ICS incident response and network monitoring to help educate and train the workforce but realized that the only way to scale human knowledge fast enough in the face of what we were seeing was to also ensure those practitioners had ICS specific cybersecurity technology as well. We needed to do this in a company that would refuse to get acquired and be a long term player to put a dent in the problem. It’s my view though that to make the best technology you need the best people and you need to be hyper informed on the changing risk landscape if you’re going to counter it. So we built Dragos focused on our visibility, monitoring, and response technology but also with a professional services team of ICS cybersecurity experts to do everything from threat hunting and pentesting to incident response and architecture reviews while being trusted advisors to our customers. To inform everything we did and to help educate our community we built an intelligence team to identify and track threats specifically focused on ICS. To date we track 14 state adversaries explicitly doing so. I say all that in context of this fund raising to say – most investors hated our approach.</p>
<p>We got off the ground with a Seed investment from DataTribe. The only reason they invested was they had a background in the intelligence community and military and understand that we were mission focused. I’m sure they didn’t know much about what we wanted to do but they knew the problem was important and we were the team that would stop at nothing to satisfy the mission. When I went to raise the Series A round of $10M to finance our operations I met with and pitched well over 100 investors. Many of them sought us out to learn more about ICS/OT cybersecurity. The broader OT security market which encompasses ICS and the industrial internet of things (IIoT) (not to be confused with IoT, Alexa and a Gas Turbine have little in common) was very interesting to investors but none of them seemed to believe it was worth focus. I received pushback from the investors that fell into three distinct camps; these camps were challenges I heard from plenty of non-investors as well that I had encountered over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies have tried to do ICS security before and failed. It’s not doable. People don’t care past regulation or fear. These companies won’t change. OT specific cybersecurity will never be successful.</li>
<li>The market is too small. If you’re interested in getting quickly acquired we’ll invest but if you’re interested in going the distance, we’re not along for the ride. The OT market is so niche.</li>
<li>IT and OT are converging. There won’t be an OT network in the years to come. IT? OT? It’s all just T. Enterprise cybersecurity will be rolled into the plants there’s no need for OT specific cybersecurity. OT specific security isn’t worth doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding people that didn’t agree with the three points above in the broader market was hard. In reality, very few of the practitioners in our small ICS security community believed such things. I think many people in our community have wondered if it’ll take some giant cyber attack on ICS to get people to take it seriously, but my view was “we’ve had all the attacks we need.” Every industry has representative attacks and stories. That wasn’t the issue or need and no one should hope for it. The reality was there wasn’t a large investable market which means for the business there was no obvious need to address this risk. I viewed building a technology company and staying around long term as necessary to getting these companies resources for workforce development, training, etc. as much as anything else.</p>
<p>On the three points here’s where I disagree in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because a few companies have failed on this path doesn’t mean that it won’t be successful. But more importantly the efforts I’ve seen failed before were largely re-skinned IT security efforts with some ICS marketing. It was obvious they were going to fail. This community does care about its infrastructure but we are a community of people who understand what does and doesn’t work. Our infrastructure members will invest beyond regulation and fear but not in things they don’t believe will work. Also undeniably over the last decade there has been a larger and more proactive community advocating cross company cross vendor cross conference etc. on what does and doesn’t work.</li>
<li>The OT market is huge. It’s hard to put a real number on it; some orgs claim 20-30B, but however you size it, it’s huge. Most people associate it with electric utilities and oil and gas. But manufacturing, rail, water, mining, transportation, etc. should come to mind. And the physical systems in the data center. And building automation systems. And airports. And and and. It’s actually harder to find companies that don’t have OT than those that do. These businesses aren’t in the business of selling emails. They produce goods, interact with the physical world, and provide services all powered by OT. The major risk is in the OT and when executives are aware of that and have an answer to address it they will in a way a majority of investors I’ve met have misunderstood.</li>
<li>IT and OT convergence happened a decade ago. I’m near tired of hearing how it’s “coming.” We have had Windows in ICS/SCADA/DCS/OT/etc. networks for more than a decade. The convergence is actually the digital transformation of these organizations coming at the same time of ICS specific adversaries. But no matter what the underlining operating system is that’s not the point. The point of OT cybersecurity is that the mission is different. The threats are different. The risks are different. The culture to get the job done is different. The challenges are different to succeed. Therefore the way you secure it will be different. I’m not saying all IT security is useless in the plants. There’s plenty we can learn from and adopt. What I’m saying is the unique and most critical part of these businesses deserves a specific focus that understands and accounts for the people, culture, process, technology, mission, risks, threats, etc. of that side of the business. To not accept that is naïve.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I went to investors saying we wanted to focus exclusively on OT cybersecurity and we wanted to partner with our customers not just in providing technology but also having smart people and actual insights to provide it didn’t go so well with most of them. You cannot describe all the VCs in one broad stroke just like you cannot describe any group; and I’ve met and really enjoyed getting to know plenty of VCs, but to say the vast majority didn’t understand this market is an understatement.</p>
<p>Not only were the pushbacks from above tangible but also “and you want to hire experts to do professional services? Won’t that lower the margins on the software sales? I don’t think that’s a good idea.” But even extremely mature companies are relatively immature in their OT cybersecurity journey and need a partner not just a technology. That’s also how we get better. So it was non-negotiable. Our team’s people are and were our secret weapon. For all the words like innovation and disruption that get flaunted in Silicon Valley it was interesting how many …</p></div></div>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.saastr.com/whats-your-moat/">What's Your Moat</a>, Jason Lemkin lists several moats (sources of defensibility) that apply to SaaS businesses. I categorised them based on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy-ebook/dp/B01MRLFFQ7">7 Powers</a> framework by Hamilton Helmer and found two powers missing (Cornered Resource and Process Power).</p><p>While Cornered Resources (such as a strong early team) are commonly considered doctrine rather than a moat, the omission of process power was more interesting.</p><h3 id="what-is-process-power">What is Process Power?</h3><p>Helmer describes companies with Process Power as follows:</p><blockquote>Benefit. A company with Process Power is able to improve product attributes and/or lower costs as a result of process improvements embedded within the organization. For example, Toyota has maintained the quality increases and cost reductions of the TPS over a span of decades; these assets do not disappear as new workers are brought in and older workers retire.<p>Barrier. The Barrier in Process Power is hysteresis: these process advances are difficult to replicate, and can only be achieved over a long time period of sustained evolutionary advance.</p></blockquote><p>He admits that process power is rare and difficult to achieve. But is it too rare to apply to SaaS companies?</p><p>On one hand, the path to growing a SaaS business is <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/atlas/guides/business-of-saas">well benchmarked</a> and there are processes describing anything from finding leads to deploying reliable infrastructure.</p><p>But there are companies that get very different results.</p><h3 id="the-process-outliers">The process outliers</h3><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> is a popular SEO tool with a fifth of the engineering resources of their biggest competitor Moz. They <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/keywords-explorer-3-0/">claim to achieve this by using an OCaml based stack</a> also favoured by Wall Street traders <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.tinycapital.com/">Tiny</a> is a start-up conglomerate that uses several ideas like simple positioning and No Code to quickly spin up new businesses in record speed. They also run one of the leading design and development studios <a href="https://www.metalab.com/">Metalab</a>, and one of the earliest No Code agencies <a href="https://www.8020.inc/">8020</a>, ensuring excellence in both areas.</p><p>Does this mean that every SaaS company should use OCaml and Webflow or is there a way to create process advantages organically?</p><p>In an industry that speeds things up traditionally with investment, we have ignored frameworks that build process advantages in a capital-agnostic way.</p><h3 id="improving-process">Improving process</h3><p>I'll offer three examples.</p><p>The first is the Theory of Constraints, a framework introduced in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0566086654">The Goal</a>. The Theory of Constraints predicts that every company is usually constrained by one bottleneck at a time, called a “constraint” and releasing that constraint is the key for increasing output.</p><p>Another theory, promoted by Douglas Engelbart is the <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/192/165/">ABCs of Organizational Improvement</a>. Engelbart argues that we should manage not only core activities (also known as “A activities” or “Business as usual”) but have explicit roadmaps for both B activities (“improving how we do A”) and C activities (“improving how we improve”). By focusing on process improvement explicitly, we can create compounding leverage for core activities.</p><p>A more modern example of continuous process improvement is described in the <a href="https://medium.com/quantumblack/the-protocol-series-how-formula-1-pitstop-teams-inspired-the-codification-of-our-ways-of-working-7b59b40a8fa1">Protocol Series</a> by QuantumBlack.</p><p>To summarise, having a great process is not the same as having great execution and we should not neglect that, even in SaaS.</p><hr><p><strong>P.S.</strong> Here is the categorization of the SaaS moats I went with.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the facts : writing code for a side-project or a class-project is very different from writing code for a large organization. Among other things, you face the following requirements :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>collaboration</strong> : it’s not only your code, so you need to make sure that the components you add play nicely with your teammates’</li>
  <li><strong>compatibility over time</strong> : not only does your new feature need to work, it also has to integrate nicely with the existing logic, without breaking everything. What’s more, in the future, you want to avoid having to modify and update your code.</li>
  <li><strong>flexibility in usage</strong> : you need to keep in mind that specifications are likely to evolve in the future, and you need to plan accordingly (as much as possible without overdoing it), as you might need to support a wider variety of use cases. Ideally, the design itself should be modular enough so that adding new functionality is easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the previous points may seem obvious, it requires patience and experience to successfully address them, especially if you write python code : as a scripting language by nature, it’s easy to forget good software-engineering practices and dive right in. After all, running code is better than nice-but-unusable code.</p>


<h2 id="a-simple-example">A simple example</h2>

<p>Let’s take a simple example : we want to compute <code>2 * x + 1</code>.</p>

<p>If I want to quickly put something together, I can just write a short script that does the job</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course this is a dummy example, but you can extrapolate, until you reach the complexity of an actual program. Once your initial script becomes too long, a natural thing to do is to create modules and helper functions, in an attempt to improve code reuse, effectively performing <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">semantic compression</a>. Now you have a script disguised as a “library”. And this is perfectly fine, if it’s the first iteration of a project, or if you only need to support one use case.</p>


<h2 id="a-need-for-configurable-code">A need for configurable code</h2>

<p>One day, the project manager comes to see you, asking to support a new use case : <code>2 * (2 * x + 1)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s easy, let’s do something like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>use_case</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>use_case</span> <span>==</span> <span>"use_case_1"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>use_case</span> <span>==</span> <span>"use_case_2"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>"Use case not supported."</span><span>)</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>"use_case_2"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In real life, this means passing combinations of arguments to helper functions, resulting in something quite complicated to maintain. As different use cases keep coming, the number of <code>if ... else ...</code> statements increases, reaching an unhealthy ratio. Soon, the combination of options forces parts of your code to support a combinatorial number of possibilities. If you have 2 main options with 10 possibilities each, and each combination requires some custom logic, that’s 10 x 10 possibilities! Chances are that in parts of the code that you may be less familiar with, a specific combination of options causes a failure. Hopefully you follow the guidelines of test-driven development and such a liability will be exposed before any release.</p>


<h2 id="modularizing-your-code">Modularizing your code</h2>

<p>After a while, the expectations become more generic and you’re required to support “all combinations of <code>2 * x</code> and <code>x + 1</code>”. Worse, you see a near future where other operations will have to be supported, like <code>3 * x</code>. You should probably isolate each of these operations from each other as well as how you combine them together.</p>

<p>After some time spent rewriting parts of the code to make it more modular, you come to the conclusion that each of these operations is independent from the others and that combining them together is another issue (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concern</a>). Each operation should be responsible of one thing and one thing only (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>), while following the same contract.</p>

<p>In python, one the right ways of doing this is to define an “interface” for your operations (let’s call them <code>layers</code>), using an abstract class</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>BaseLayer</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and implement different versions of that base class</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PlusOneLayer</span><span>(</span><span>BaseLayer</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>class</span> <span>TimesTwoLayer</span><span>(</span><span>BaseLayer</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, chaining the layers is the job of some other class</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Model</span><span>:</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span> <span>=</span> <span>layers</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>layer</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>:</span>
            <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example we used object-oriented programming to modularize the code, but other options are also possible (using functions with similar signatures for example). However, the nice thing about OOP is that it lets you define contracts. Once implemented, your editor will help you find errors and it might speedup the whole development process while improving code robustness.</p>


<h2 id="using-the-modularized-code">Using the modularized code</h2>

<p>Okay so now we have abstracted and isolated the different components of the program. How do we use it?</p>


<h3 id="with-python-scripts-outside-the-library">With python scripts outside the library</h3>

<p>The easiest way is to let the different users of your library define one script per pipeline. For each of the previous use cases, we end up with a script</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># use-case-one.py
</span><span>times_two</span> <span>=</span> <span>TimesTwoLayer</span><span>()</span>
<span>plus_one</span> <span>=</span> <span>PlusOneLayer</span><span>()</span>
<span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>Model</span><span>([</span><span>times_two</span><span>,</span> <span>plus_one</span><span>])</span>
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, it may look like we haven’t made a lot of progress. It turns out that in the process of making our code modular and reusable in a nice an abstract way</p>
<ul>
  <li>we created a library (a collection of tools that can be easily re-used), in other words, we created a high-level API that users can build on (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw">how to design a good API and why it matters</a>)</li>
  <li>we separated the layers’ <strong>implementation</strong> (don’t forget that this is a dummy example but the actual operations you are implementing are much more complicated) from <strong>usage</strong>. Actually, each of these scripts can be seen as a special configuration.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is interesting to notice that the workflow manager <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">airflow</a> lets you define pipelines using a python interface (Directed Acyclic Graphs, Operators, etc.). From the documentation : <em>“One thing to wrap your head around (it may not be very intuitive for everyone at first) is that [Airflow Python scripts are] really just configuration files specifying DAG’s structure as code”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this may sound obvious, it is crucial to separate implementation from usage, especially because it’s so easy to mix the two and end up with a library that is part script-like and usage-specific, side-by-side with a collection of helper functions that may have otherwise been reusable for a wider variety of use cases.</p>


<h3 id="with-config-files">With config files</h3>

<p>While python files are probably sufficient in most cases (and this should probably always be possible because pipeline creators are likely to be programmers, and who knows what they will have in mind), some situations might benefit from the use of a more convenient pipeline definition format. Advantages and requirements may include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid duplication by splitting configs into sub-configs.</li>
  <li>Use a format that can easily be shared.</li>
  <li>Provide a way for non-programmers to define their own pipelines.</li>
  <li>Provide a lightweight, less-verbose way of defining pipelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of good formats that are widely adopted in the python community</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>.json</code> (JavaScript Object Notation), probably the most popular format, as it resembles python dictionaries.</li>
  <li><a href="https://jsonnet.org/"><code>.jsonnet</code></a>, built on top of json, adds support for imports, variable definition and much more, before “compilation” to a standard <code>.json</code>.</li>
  <li><code>.ini</code> (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html">configparser</a>)</li>
  <li><code>.yaml</code></li>
  <li><code>.xml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Having said that, the question becomes : what do we write in these configuration files, and how do we reload them?</p>

<p>Usually, the first step would be to implement a way to create an object from a python dictionary. There are multiple ways of doing it</p>
<ul>
  <li>define a <code>Serializable</code> interface and have each class implement a class method <code>from_params(cls, params)</code> that creates an object from a dictionary.
    <div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Serializable</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

  <span>@</span><span>abstractclassmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>from_params</span><span>(</span><span>cls</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>):</span>
      <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>For example</p>
    <div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Model</span><span>(</span><span>Serializable</span><span>):</span>

  <span>@</span><span>classmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>from_params</span><span>(</span><span>cls</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>):</span>
      <span>transforms</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
      <span>for</span> <span>transform_name</span> <span>in</span> <span>params</span><span>[</span><span>"transforms"</span><span>]:</span>
          <span>if</span> <span>transform_name</span> <span>==</span> <span>"times_two"</span><span>:</span>
              <span>transforms</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>TimesTwoLayer</span><span>())</span>
          <span>elif</span> <span>transform_name</span> <span>==</span> <span>"plus_one"</span><span>:</span>
              <span>transforms</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>PlusOneLayer</span><span>())</span>
          <span>else</span><span>:</span>
              <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>()</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>Model</span><span>(</span><span>transforms</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is basically what the <code>FromParams</code> class does in the <a href="https://github.com/allenai/allennlp">AllenNLP</a> library.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>use a <code>Schema</code> approach. In other words, delegate the creation of objects from dictionaries to another class. This is probably the most common approach, but might be overkill in some cases. Have a look at the great <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">marshmallow</a> library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another tip : you might want to validate and normalize the dictionaries before creating instances from them. This can be useful to check for missing entries, fill-out default values, rename parameters, etc. I’ve been using <a href="https://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/">cerberus</a> for that purpose.</p>

<p>Now, our different use cases can be defined in simple <code>.json</code> files</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"transforms"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"times_two"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"plus_one"</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"transforms"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"times_two"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"plus_one"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"times_two"</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
