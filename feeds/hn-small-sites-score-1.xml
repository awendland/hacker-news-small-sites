							<p><span>Big name corporations with robust growth profiles are more likely to be caught up in corporate fraud than smaller, struggling firms.</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate fraud is an illegal, unethical, and highly strategized maneuver committed by a company or an individual associated with the company in order to defraud investors, and the government of millions and even billions in tax revenue. The fraud schemes involve approaches to misrepresent the company’s financial standing by use of false accounting practices.</span></p>
<p><span>In a corporate world, this type of elite, while-collar crime is not very uncommon. In fact, it’s been going on since the 15th century England.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In the study published in <em><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2020.1853799?journalCode=rjqy20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justice Quarterly</a></em>, the researchers zeroed in on data on more than 250 U.S. public corporations that had involvement in financial securities fraud identified in more than 1000 Securities and Exchange Commission filings from 2005 to 2013. </span></p>
<p><span>Upon comparing their characteristics to a control sample of over 500 firms (from Compustat) that were not listed in SEC fiscal evasion filings, they found growing fads in the risk of fraud including corporations that were listed in the Fortune 500, traded on the NYSE and had strong growth prospects.</span></p>
<p><span>“Prestigious companies, those that are household names, were actually more prone to engage in financial fraud, which was very surprising,” said Jennifer Schwartz, WSU sociologist and lead author on the study in <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/2021/02/02/big-name-corporations-likely-commit-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news release</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>“We thought it would be companies that were struggling financially, that were nearing bankruptcy, but it was quite the opposite. It was the companies that thought they should be doing better than they were, the ones with strong growth imperatives–those were the firms that were most likely to cheat.”</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate financial securities frauds are usually surreptitious and nonviolent in nature. They are also understudied especially when compared with street crimes, even though they can inflict far worse devastating effects on the economy.</span></p>
<p>D<span>etection and prosecution of this type of elite crime can also be highly challenging because the individuals involved in it usually go to great lengths in order to conceal their activities.</span></p>
<p><span>“What these companies were doing was essentially fudging the numbers, lying to investors, other companies and the SEC,” said Schwartz. “Eventually, you have to make up for the money that was lost, that really never existed, so shareholders lose money, people lose retirement plans, people lose jobs. It’s very, very damaging.”</span></p>
<p><span>For the study, the team looked at the time period where a massive financial collapse that shook Wall Street to its core, took place. They also incorporated data on the fraud <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/worldcom-s-magic-trick-356121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scandals of WorldCom</a> and <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/enron-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enron</a>, and the subsequent regulatory Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.</span></p>
<p><span>The intent of the study was to figure out the operations at publicly traded companies in which there was high probability for perpetrating fraud.</span></p>
<p><span>They found that big corporations with Fortune 500 status were represented nearly four times as often among the firms that had committed fraud than the control group with no history of financial fraud. Similarly, firms that traded on NYSE were represented 2 times more among fraudulent firms compared to non-fraud, which is higher than those that trade on other exchanges like the NASDAQ or OTC.</span></p>
<p>The study also found that fraud is more prevalent when the CEO was also the chair of the board, but the potential link between the extent of fraud and position in the company is yet to be established.</p>
<p><span>“We need to look more at corporate leadership arrangements, and the responsibility of individuals in creating the culture of the company itself,” explained </span><span>Schwartz</span><span>. “How can leaders encourage companies to be more successful not only in terms of profit or growth but also in terms of corporate social responsibility?”</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <div> <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"> <p>While Tinybird is not a log analysis tool per se, it’s a tool that you can use as the foundation to analyze logs-like datasets at scale. Here you’ll learn:</p> <ul> <li>how to use it to analyze NGINX logs</li> <li>how to publish your SQL queries as API endpoints to be used in other tools</li> <li>and how to model your data sources and endpoints to make it 10X faster.</li> </ul> <p>An NGINX log looks like this:</p>  <p>It’s not a CSV file but a “space separated file” so in principle Tinybird wouldn’t load it because we just support CSV files. But if we analyze the file using our <a href="https://docs.tinybird.co/cli.html">CLI tool</a>:</p>  <p>The delimiter is guessed so it can be loaded.</p>  <p>The format looks like this:</p>  <p>We need to transform it to something useful. To transform data we use a pipe.</p>  <p>Now let’s query the new pipe:</p>  <p>You could now publish an endpoint:</p>  <p>So far so good. But what happens when you have millions of entries a day, the generated endpoints wouldn’t be as fast as needed. For example, for endpoints serving real time dashboards, where the user can pick different date ranges, add filters and so on, waiting for more than a second is not the best solution. So there is an easy solution: generate views as data arrives.</p> <p>So, let’s create a Materialized view (MV from now on) for the previous endpoint:</p>  <p>There are many things to notice:</p> <ul> <li>The materialized view SQL is almost the same than the endpoint but instead of count it uses countState and the same for avg. Those -State modifiers are needed when pushing data to a MV. The datasource where the MV pushes the data has two columns with a special data type to store those <code>-State</code></li> <li>The Engine is not the regular MergeTree, it’s an <code>AggregatingMergeTree</code> that tells ClickHouse to aggregate columns on merge operations (executed periodically, you don’t need to worry about that)</li> <li>The sorting key tells ClickHouse which column we are grouping by</li> </ul> <p>We push the files</p>  <p>We use <code>--push-deps</code> to upload all the dependencies and <code>--populate</code> to fill the materialized view with the data already in <code>log_transform</code></p> <p>Now we check the amount of rows in that table:</p>  <p>If we push new data with new IP addresses, the amount of rows will rise but, comparing the amount of rows in the original table with the MV datasource, you can understand why it is going to be faster. And the good thing - this table is updated when you push new data, it does not need to be recalculated.</p>  <p>The last thing is to change the endpoint to use the new table</p>   <p>Let’s test the endpoint and compare with the old one</p>  <p>Both are really fast but the last one is one order of magnitude faster.</p> <p>You could create MV for any case you can think of, for example:</p> <ul> <li>unique ip addreeses by day: <code>select toDate(time) day, uniqState(ip_address) uniq_ip from log_transform group by day</code></li> <li>percentile 95 of payload size per hour: <code>select toStartOfHour(time) hour, quantileState(0.95)(ip_address) q95 from log_transform group by hour</code></li> <li>requests per month: <code>select toStartOfMonth(time) month, countState() requests_count from log_transform group by month</code></li> </ul> <p>Materialized views are a really powerful feature specially when you are creating real time endpoints.</p> <p>We created a <a href="https://github.com/tinybirdco/log_parsing_template">github repo</a> with the data project so you can reproduce the post commands in your Tinybird account and start analysing your own logs.</p> </div>  </article>  </div> </div></div>]]>

        <p><em>Most of the time, a backend is just a layer between APIs and a database. Using the Postgrest project and
                some SQL we will build a backend without any Java, Golang, C# etc…</em></p>
        <p><em>For this Demo, we will build a chat application with channels, messages, users and user profiles.</em>
        </p>
        <p><code>March 02,2020</code></p>
        <h2 id="firstadatabase">First, a database</h2>
        <p>Database, an essential tool for every project on the web. Relationnal databases are not new… almost 50 years
            !
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database</a>
        </p>
        <p>With stored procedures, views, user management, roles and a query langage we all know we can do whatever we
            want on our data. With frameworks, ORM and other tools that makes great integration between Object langages
            and Relational Databases we spend most of time using them to access data in a simple way, so simple that we
            can do directly with SQL.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">https://www.postgresql.org/</a> is a very popular open source database
            system, so let's go with it.</p>
        <p>Now our docker-compose file starts with : </p>
        <pre><code>version: '3'
        services:
          db:
            image: postgres
            ports:
              - "5432:5432"
            environment:
              POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        </code></pre>
        <h2 id="anauthenticationserverkeycloakwithpleaseopenit">An authentication server : keycloak with please-open.it
        </h2>
        <p>Go to <a href="https://console.please-open.it/">https://console.please-open.it</a> and subscribe to a free
            keycloak realm. It is the easiest way to start.</p>
        <p>This realm will provide JWT tokens we need to authenticate users on our DB. JWT tokens are signed with a
            private key. We need to retreive a public key in order to verify token signature.
            Go to "realm settings", "keys", and get the public key for RSA RS256 algorithm.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/public_key.png" alt="public_key"></p>
        <p>This key is in PEM format. For postgrest, we need it in JWK.
            A simple tool online can do it for you : <a href="https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp">https://8gwifi.org/jwkconvertfunctions.jsp</a></p>
        <p>Add "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----" and "-----END PUBLIC KEY-----" delimiters, paste your key and transform it
            to JWK.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/pem_to_jwk.png" alt="pem to jwk"></p>
        <h3 id="createaclient">Create a client</h3>
        <p>A client for a web frontend is needed, to get an access<em>token after login. Go to "clients" and create a
                new one. This client in this example is named "frontend". Choose access type "public", and define the
                redirect</em>uri to "https://playground.please-open.it/" for now.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/new_client.png" alt="new client"></p>
        <h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
        <p>Go to "roles" tab in the client, we need only 2 roles : standard and admin. Create them, after we will
            associate to users.
            <img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/roles.png" alt="roles"></p>
        <h3 id="users">Users</h3>
        <p>2 users "standard" and 1 "admin". </p>
        <p>After creating a user, remove all "required user actions", go to "credentials" and attribute a new password.
            In "Role Mappings", select your client "frontend" and add a "standard", or "admin" role.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/role_mapping.png" alt="add roles"></p>
        <h3 id="webapplication">Web application</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to obtain a token, is your (playground)[https://playground.please-open.it]. An opensource web
            application, oauth2 client for keycloak and token introspection.
            In "parameters", put your realm id and client id. Now we are ready to retreive a new token. Click on
            "login", enter a user credentials and the redirect will do the job.</p>
        <p><img src="https://www.mathieupassenaud.fr/codeless_backend/_Codeless_%20backend_files/login.png" alt="login"></p>
        <p>An access_token is retreived and decoded. The base64 encoded will be used later, in each api call.</p>
        <h2 id="restapispostgrest">REST APIs : postgrest</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational<em>state</em>transfer</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="http://postgrest.org/en/v6.0/">Postgrest</a> is a standalone app with a web server, turning a
            database directly into a RESTful API. Sometimes the only way we are using ORM for.</p>
        <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
        <p>Authentication is ensured by JWT tokens. Postgrest verifies the signature with the given key (using
            "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable), then get a role in the token's payload.</p>
        <p>In order to verify the signature, a public key is needed. Retreive the JWK you have generated previously and
            paste is ENTIERLY in the "PGRST<em>JWT</em>SECRET" variable.</p>
        <h3 id="anonymousrole">Anonymous role</h3>
        <p>An anonymous role gives access to data without any authentication. We gives to postgrest a name of an
            anonymous role. By using this, all resources granted to this role will be accessible without a token.</p>
        <p>PGRST<em>DB</em>ANON<em>ROLE: web</em>anon</p>

        <p>Only select is permitted on web_anon.</p>
        <p>Now we register a new role "standard" which corresponds to the role we created previously in keycloak.
            With the configuration, postgrest will check in JWT token at resource<em>access.frontend.roles[0] value is

It used to autohide after 3 seconds and it was one of the most infuriating things about Google Meet.</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png" alt="Google Meet UI Screenshot showing the bottom bar with Mute/Unmute button always visible." srcset="https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1000w, https://neil.computer/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1600w, https://neil.computer/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-03-at-11.54.00-PM.png 1918w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bottom bar with the Mute button is always visible now.</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing if you're muted or unmuted is probably the number 1 most important interface element of any A/V conference application.

From the ground up, from fundamentals, from axioms of human behavior, from analytical standpoint, with experimental insights, and then a mandatory - "Aesthetics is secondary" course. If your knee-jerk reaction to what I just said is "But, Aesthetics sells." - yes it does, if you're selling trinkets and wind-catchers at a tourist shop. Not for business critical applications.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>UX/UI professionals need to study deeply how humans and machines interact. I remember referencing the classic High Performance HMI book many years ago in engineering college. Obviously nuclear powerplant operators and their interface needs are not exactly the same as a corporate manager trying to make a funny joke out of "Oh, I was on mute.", but I think there is some value in atleast understanding the methodologies and formalisms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">Engineering rigor and systems engineering</a> approach can be applied to many other fields.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</a> is often the first tool that many webmasters reach for when confronted with the need to stop spam and automated malicious traffic from harming their services. In this post I explain several reasons why ReCAPTCHA is usually not the best solution to use for this purpose, as it is often unnecessary, inconveniences users, and subjects users to intensive tracking and fingerprinting that they are not able to opt-out of. Several alternative solutions to ReCAPTCHA for various threat models are presented as well as best practices for implementing captchas in general. <br></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="436" height="119" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png" alt="" srcset="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha.png 436w, https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-300x82.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption>The face of evil</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>ReCAPTCHA is yet another free-of-charge product offered benevolently by Google for any webmaster to implement within their own services. How does ReCAPTCHA differentiate legitimate human users from bots? ReCAPTCHA relies extensively on user fingerprinting, putting emphasis on the question of “Which human is this user?” rather than the ordinary “Is this user human?”. It’s worth noting how much easier it is to successfully solve ReCAPTCHAs when the user is logged into their Google account, thus allowing Google to associate their actions with their real identity. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9vmsyp/google_recaptchas_targeting_firefox_and_other/">similar effect</a> is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20147015">often reported</a> for users of non-Google browsers, who notice ReCAPTCHAs take more time to complete in Firefox over Chrome. This is in-line with <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-mozilla-vp-says-google-intentionally-damaged-firefox/">many other anti-competitive techniques</a> that Google has used over the years to help grow their market share.</p>



<p>Although determining
exactly how ReCAPTCHA works is very difficult, with Google not only
heavily obfuscating its JavaScript, but also implementing an entire
VM in JavaScript with its own bytecode language, there have still
been many attempts to reverse-engineer some of the client-side code,
as well as to theorize about how the server-side logic operates.
<a href="https://github.com/toogle/InsideReCaptcha">Initial attempts</a>
at reverse-engineering ReCAPTCHA show copious amounts of information
belong collected, including but not limited to: plugins, user agent,
IP address, screen resolution, execution times, timezone, language,
click/keyboard/touch information within the frame of the captcha,
test results of many browser-specific functions and CSS evaluation,
information about canvas element rendering, and cookies, including
those affiliated with your Google account that were placed within the
last 6 months.</p>



<p>There is a good reason why ReCAPTCHA uses the google.com domain instead of one specific to ReCAPTCHA. This allows Google to receive any cookies that they have already set for you, effectively bypassing restrictions on setting third party cookies and allowing traffic correlation with all of Google’s other services, which most users use. ReCAPTCHA collects enough information that it could reliably de-anonymize many users that simply wish to prove that they are Not A Robot. As JavaScript is now required to even view a ReCAPTCHA, even a user running software such as TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) may find themselves giving away more information than they intend to, for example if they have resized their browser window (which is discouraged for exactly this reason).</p>



<p>Correspondingly, webmasters that use Google’s ReCAPTCHA on their websites must link to both Google’s <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Privacy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en">Terms</a> pages (included in the form by default in a small 8px style that makes them appear unclickable). Although Google used to have its own privacy and terms pages for ReCAPTCHA, these links are no longer specific to ReCAPTCHA, but rather are the privacy and terms pages for all users of Google services in general, regardless of which service is being used, or if the user has (or even wants) a Google account to begin with. Therefore accepting these terms (implicitly, by attempting to prove you are Not A Robot) grants Google permission to do <strong>everything</strong> that they do to their regular users of their services to you, and little information is available as to what specifically is done (GDPR is likely to be unhelpful here, given ReCAPTCHA’s spam-stopping purpose). Not only are the unhelpful links in the ReCAPTCHA box never opened by users, but there is also no Google logo or visual reference to indicate that ReCAPTCHA is a Google service, so many users have zero indication that they have just consented to all of Google’s tracking just because they tried to leave feedback or create a ticket on your website. If you thought you could use the Internet without using Google’s services, try using the Internet without filling out a single ReCAPTCHA, which for some users is required to pay their bills, file their taxes, and sometimes even use Government websites (if you somehow manage this, next try never sending email to Gmail/Gsuite addresses or using Google APIs for a more exciting challenge). Good luck.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that caring about user privacy to this extent is likely to be outside of the scope of concern for most websites. Many websites are already so tightly coupled to Google’s services (commonly including Google analytics, Google ads, Google APIs, Google tag manager, Google static resources, Google OAuth, Google Compute Engine, and many others) that the addition of a Google captcha appears negligible. With that said, different websites have different values and different users, and many do not want to require users to agree to Google’s tracking and labor for basic usage. The level of centralization that ReCAPTCHA forces is not good for anyone except Google.</p>



<p>Apart from the privacy implications of ReCAPTCHA usage, the actual captcha is very tedious for many classes of users, sometimes becoming so difficult that users find themselves unable to to complete the captcha at all. <a href="https://github.com/google/recaptcha/issues/286">Users hate ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8yezeq/fuck_recaptcha/">They</a> <a href="https://devrant.com/rants/1754031/fuck-recaptcha-fuck-google-for-making-recaptcha-fuck-it-dont-be-evil-my-foot">really</a> <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/the-select-all-images-with-a-street-sign-recaptcha-is-a-godless-creation-of-evil.1410504/">hate</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19059390">ReCAPTCHA</a>. <a href="https://recaptcha.sucks/">ReCAPTCHA</a> <a href="https://strugee.net/blog/2019/04/make-recaptchas-im-not-a-robot-accurate">is</a> <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/recaptcha-is-uxs-worst-nightmare-c28b7341e88a">so</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/9haexn/googles_recaptcha_needs_to_be_fucking_made_illegal/">hated</a> that <a href="https://www.4chan.org/pass">some websites</a> have a profit model of charging users $20 annually to disable ReCAPTCHA, which <strong>thousands </strong>of users pay for. If this sounds like a great new business model to you and now you want to add ReCAPTCHAs to every page of your website to attempt to maximize profit, I will find you. And I will force you to complete a ReCAPTCHA every time you want food or water until you die from malnutrition after the first week. I have read countless posts from users that became so frustrated with a service that used excessive ReCAPTCHAs that they swore to never use the offending website again. These are often intelligent users with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/#version-2-are-you-a-robot">no disabilities</a> who are simply tired of being treated like dirt and wasting their time. Be kind to your users and help minimize the amount of ReCAPTCHAS that they have to solve just to be allowed to use the Internet.</p>



<p>ReCAPTCHAs become significantly more difficult if the user attempts to ‘opt-out’ of Google’s services and tracking by using software that hinders it, such as VPNs, TBB, and many anti-tracking browser addons and modifications. To demonstrate what is meant by ‘very tedious’, below is a real-time recording of myself solving a single ReCAPTCHA using TBB:</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://nearcyan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/recaptcha-1.webm"></video><figcaption>Spambots are known to give up when forced to be patient</figcaption></figure>



<p>I got lucky and only needed to complete two challenges. Sometimes there are ten or more. Watching the above video, you might think to yourself “I knew the tor network was slow, but I didn’t know it was <em>that</em> slow!”. You would be correct to take note of this discrepancy. If we open up the web developer console, we can see that the HTTP requests for new captcha images only take a few hundred milliseconds. Despite this, Google’s heavily-obfuscated JavaScript intentionally delays the appearance of the new images by several seconds every time, which I’m sure has something to do with the fact that bots give up when forced to wait, probably. This is not a nice way to treat users that don’t want to perform unpaid labor and be fingerprinted by Google. Keep in mind that the above video demonstrates one of the worst possible cases of ReCAPTCHA UX (which some <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/31088-morecaptcha/code">userscripts</a> may improve), and that the average user has a significantly quicker experience, providing that they are not attempting to thwart any of Google’s tracking and don’t make many mistakes.</p>



<p>In addition to this tediousness, the actual labor that the user is performing is directly used to benefit Google. Worry not however, as Google is eager to brag about the selfless humanitarianism that you’re engaging in by choosing ReCAPTCHA, stating the following on their main ReCAPTCHA <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/">page</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Hundreds of millions of captchas are solved by people every day. ReCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channeling the time spent solving captchas into digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This
is certainly a very rosy way of convincing
you to feel good about forcing
your users to engage in unpaid labor that directly benefits the
world’s most powerful surveillance corporation. ReCAPTCHA
is free for a reason.</p>



<p>Lastly, ReCAPTCHA is popular. Very popular. While this brings some advantages, it also means that there’s significant efforts to break ReCAPTCHA, and those efforts all potentially affect your website, with your captcha implementation being perfectly identical to a million others. As a result of this, there have been <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf">many</a> <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/wangz3/publications/ccs18.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://uncaptcha.cs.umd.edu/papers/uncaptcha_woot17.pdf">published</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha">that</a> <a href="https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2">break</a> <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6368/eaag2612">ReCAPTCHA</a> over the years, generally with Google making modifications to improve their captcha afterwards. There have also been <a href="https://2captcha.com/">paid-for</a> <a href="https://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">services</a> that use human labor to solve captchas on behalf of a paying client for less than a cent each.

<p>Before implementing a captcha, it’s worth considering if one is
necessary to begin with. To help with evaluating this proposition,
consider if your threat model is concerned over <em>customized</em> or
<em>uncustomized</em> spam. Uncustomized spam is pervasive across many

<p><span>By Grant Ainsley | Tips | [comments] | Posted &nbsp;[date]</span></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Second Edition of the 20-volume Oxford Dictionary says there are 171,476 words in use in the English language and adds there are 47,156 words considered obsolete. A vocabulary of just 3,000 words will cover 95% of the words anyone needs to use. <br></h2>

<p>I have a simple question then - why do we need to invent new words?<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This blog is somewhat of a rant against inventing new words and taking perfectly good longer words and coming up with shorter, catchy versions. Stop doing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What is a Lifehack?</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered where new words come from? We go through life and use all the words we need in certain situations and seemingly all of a sudden, we keep seeing and hearing new words being used in place of old ones.</p>

<p>Exhibit #1 is the use of the word “hacks”. I’ve wondered for the last year where the term came from? I’ve been seeing it everywhere, including from many of my counterparts. It seemed to have replaced “tips” or “strategies”, which, by the way, are perfectly fine words and don’t need to be replaced.</p>

<p>In the past, when the term hack was used, it wasn’t good. Less skilled hockey players or golfers have been called hacks. When somebody gets “hacked” it’s not a good thing. Mind you, if “being hacked” is just an excuse to cover up some embarrassing social media behavior, then I guess it is a positive.</p>

<p>I’ve also seen the term “lifehacks” appear and although I wasn’t totally sure, it seems lifehacks are tips or strategies to make your life better in some way. I was just guessing though because I must have missed the memo explaining what lifehacks really means.</p>

<p>How do these words get suddenly appear and used? Does a group of people, like a committee, sit in a room somewhere and approve these words for general use?</p>

<h3>Wiki Wins</h3>
<p>I went to the authority on everything – Wikipedia, and got the answer.&nbsp; Here’s what Wiki says about hacks:</p>
<p><em>Life hack (or life hacking) refers to any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases productivity and efficiency, in all walks of life. The term was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from information overload, or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in ways other than programming.</em></p>

<p>Wiki was good enough to even tell me how this word came into existence:</p>
<p><em>The term life hack was coined in 2004 during the O’Rieilly Emerging Technology Conference in San Diego, California by technology journalist Danny O’Brien to describe the "embarrassing" scripts and shortcuts productive IT professionals use to get their work done. After his presentation, use of the term life hack spread in the tech and blogging community.</em></p>

<p><em>The American Dialect Society voted lifehack (one word) as the runner-up for "most useful word of 2005" behind podcast. The word was also added to the Oxford Dictionaries Online in June 2011.</em></p>

<p>Excuse me? Lifehack got voted the second most useful word over a decade ago? I must have missed that story. Lifehacks in now in the Oxford Dictionary? Can I demand a recount?</p>

<h3>Evil Cousins to Real Words</h3>
<p>While I’m at it, I would like to demand people stop making up words that are abbreviations for longer words that, once again, are perfectly fine and have been used for years.</p>

<p>Apparently, you no longer make reservations at restaurants or other places. You now make “resos”.</p>
<p>You don’t order appetizers, you order “appies”</p>
<p>They are no longer called journalists because they’re now “journos”.</p>
<p>You don’t have a conversation, you have a “convo”.</p>
<p>You don’t go on a holiday anymore, you go on a “vacay”.</p>
<p>It’s no longer the May Long Weekend, it’s now “May Long”. If we wanted to be really accurate, it’s actually the Victoria Day Long weekend.</p>

<h3>Just Stop It!</h3>
<p>I know cute, shortened words and phrases are being used because the actual word is too long. Reservations, as an example, has four syllables. Have we got to the point now where we can’t use four syllable words? Does it take too long? Is this like using acronyms when you text like LOL? Is it too difficult for young people?</p>

<p>There. I’ve said it. It’s an age thing. These words are invented by younger people. I don’t want this to turn into an old guy rant, but I do wish people would stop inventing words to replace other perfectly good words I’ve used all my life.</p>

<p>It’s like going to a bakery to buy a loaf of bread and you ask for one and the clerk tells you it’s now called something else. When the hell did this happen? Who renamed it?</p>

<p>Perhaps Twitter, when you could only use 140 characters, had something to do with shorter words being used. Now that we have 280 characters on Twitter, can we go back to the full words please?</p>

<p>I’ve made a pledge never to use one of these words. Quite frankly I feel stupid just typing them.</p>

<p>Now get off my lawn!</p>

 <p>Generative Art in Go is a short eBook intended to introduce novice and experienced programmers to algorithmic art, and hopefully, get non-programmers interested in the <a href="https://golang.org/">Go programming language</a>. Unlike popular choices such as <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a>, <a href="https://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>, etc., I picked Go for two simple reasons:</p><ul><li>Go's syntax is easy enough that virtually anyone can learn it quickly.</li><li>The language is far more versatile than what most programmers use it for.</li></ul><p>Generative art is a unique form of artistic expression, building bridges between computer programming, randomness, and visual aesthetics. It has kept my imagination for over a decade. While I have never been particularly skilled at drawing, I have always been amazed by what one could achieve with a couple of lines of code.</p><p>This book will introduce readers to graphics programming in the Go programming language context through a series of concise examples. It will also guide them in implementing their version of one of my favorite generative art sketches. As a bonus, readers will learn how to turn their command-line sketches into interactive Web applications, using <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> and Web technology's latest standards.</p><p>Happy reading!</p>

		<p>Gasoline and diesel engines, which are powered by fossil fuels, will soon be sidelined by climate change. Instead, new propulsion systems will be required. One fuel with a big potential is hydrogen. Hydrogen vehicles are equipped with a reinforced tank that is fueled at a pressure of 700 bar. This tank feeds a fuel cell, which converts the hydrogen into electricity. This in turn drives an electric motor to propels the vehicle. In the case of passenger cars, this technology is well advanced, with several hundred hydrogen-powered automobiles already in operation on German roads. At the same time, the network of hydrogen stations in Germany is projected to grow from 100 to 400 over the next three years. Yet hydrogen is not currently an option for small vehicles such as electric scooters and motorcycles, since the pressure surge during refilling would be too great. Does this effectively shut out such vehicles from hydrogen technology?</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE: the hydrogen technology for small vehicles</b></h4> 
<p>Not at all! Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM in Dresden have now come up with a hydrogen-based fuel that is ideal for small vehicles: POWERPASTE, which is based on solid magnesium hydride. “POWERPASTE stores hydrogen in a chemical form at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to be then released on demand,” explains Dr. Marcus Vogt, research associate at Fraunhofer IFAM. And given that POWERPASTE only begins to decompose at temperatures of around 250 °C, it remains safe even when an e-scooter stands in the baking sun for hours. Moreover, refueling is extremely simple. Instead of heading to the filling station, riders merely have to replace an empty cartridge with a new one and then refill a tank with mains water. This can be done either at home or underway.</p> 
<p>The starting material of POWERPASTE is magnesium, one of the most abundant elements and, therefore, an easily available raw material. Magnesium powder is combined with hydrogen to form magnesium hydride in a process conducted at 350 °C and five to six times atmospheric pressure. An ester and a metal salt are then added in order to form the finished product. Onboard the vehicle, the POWERPASTE is released from a cartridge by means of a plunger. When water is added from an onboard tank, the ensuing reaction generates hydrogen gas in a quantity dynamically adjusted to the actual requirements of the fuel cell. In fact, only half of the hydrogen originates from the POWERPASTE; the rest comes from the added water. “POWERPASTE thus has a huge energy storage density,” says Vogt. “It is substantially higher than that of a 700 bar high-pressure tank. And compared to batteries, it has ten times the energy storage density.” This means that POWERPASTE offers a range comparable to – or even greater than – gasoline. And it also provides a higher range than compressed hydrogen at a pressure of 700 bar.</p> 
<h4><b>Suitable for e-scooters – and other applications as well</b></h4> 
<p>With its huge energy storage density, POWERPASTE is also an interesting option for cars, delivery vehicles and range extenders in battery-powered electric vehicles. Similarly, it could also significantly extend the flight time of large drones, which would thereby be able to fly for several hours rather than a mere 20 minutes. This would be especially useful for survey work, such as the inspection of forestry or power lines. In another kind of application, campers might also use POWERPASTE in a fuel cell to generate electricity to power a coffeemaker or toaster.</p> 
<h4><b>POWERPASTE helps overcome lack of infrastructure</b></h4> 
<p>In addition to providing a high operating range, POWERPASTE has another point in its favor. Unlike gaseous hydrogen, it does not require a costly infrastructure. This makes it ideal for areas lacking such an infrastructure. In places where there are no hydrogen stations, regular filling stations could therefore sell POWERPASTE in cartridges or canisters instead. The paste is fluid and pumpable. It can therefore be supplied by a standard filling line, using relatively inexpensive equipment. Initially, filling stations could supply smaller quantities of POWERPASTE – from a metal drum, for example – and then expand in line with demand. This would require capital expenditure of several tens of thousands of euros. By way of comparison, a filling station to pump hydrogen at high pressure currently costs between one and two million euros for each fuel pump. POWERPASTE is also cheap to transport, since no costly high-pressure tanks are involved nor the use of extremely cold liquid hydrogen.</p> 
<h4><b>Pilot center planned for 2021</b></h4> 
<p>Fraunhofer IFAM is currently building a production plant for POWERPASTE at the Fraunhofer Project Center for Energy Storage and Systems ZESS. Scheduled to go into operation in 2021, this new facility will be able to produce up to four tons of POWERPASTE a year – not only for e-scooters.</p></div></div>]]>

We've also released a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privanote-extension/bmpjebghajghighjhanphoekfenjkeao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome extension</a> and a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/privanote-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox addon</a> to help you take notes as seamlessly as possible.</p><p>With that said, let's dive into how we built this!</p><h3>Overview<a href="#overview" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>PrivaNote is a <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> application with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TailwindCSS</a> to make it look pretty. The editor is a reasonably customised <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> instance. Setting up these components to play nicely is a breeze thanks to modern tooling.</p><p>Without setting up the encrypted backup PrivaNote will write to your browsers IndexedDB or LocalStorage. After setting up and initialising your Portabella configuration it will read and write from there.</p><h3>Scaffolding out application<a href="#scaffolding-out-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Our initialisation script looked a little like this:</p><p>We took a lot of inspiration for our editor from one of the examples the <a href="https://github.com/udecode/slate-plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slate-plugins</a> library provides.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to IndexedDB<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-indexeddb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>After scaffolding our application we needed to ensure it's offline first. That means we should be able to use it without an internet connection and without Portabella. For this we leveraged the <a href="https://github.com/localForage/localForage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localForage</a> library. It tries to use IndexedDB and then falls back to LocalStorage if the browser doesn't have it.</p><p>We could have written this layer ourselves but it just made sense to bring in a dependency to make sure we didn't mess anything up.</p><p>To read all of our notes it looks a bit like this:</p><p>Creating a note is as easy as:</p><p>We won't show you the delete operation because, well, you get the gist.</p><h3>Reading/writing notes from/to Portabella<a href="#readingwriting-notes-fromto-portabella" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Setting up our Portabella integration is a little trickier. We have a few additional constraints here, we need to:</p><ul><li>save Portabella config in our local database</li><li>check if they have Portabella config before falling back to the local database storage</li><li>prompt users to setup their Portabella integration (after 10 seconds to not be annoying).</li></ul><p>Let's cover reading and writing data before we get to the administrative tasks. Writing a note to Portabella leveraging the <a href="https://github.com/portabellainc/privanote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabella/sdk</a> is as easy as:</p><p>Reading all our notes (when we refresh the page for example looks like):</p><p>The SDK takes care of decrypting everything for us so we don't need to worry about getting data we can't read.</p><h3>Prompting for Portabella credentials<a href="#prompting-for-portabella-credentials" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Before we can do the above operations we need to ensure we actually have Portabella config so we can initialise the SDK and make requests.</p><p>To do this we want to prompt the user to setup their integration after 10 seconds on PrivaNote. Additionally we don't want to prompt them again if they've already said yes (or no).</p><p>Our React <code>useEffect</code> hook looks a bit like this:</p><p>Doing it this way allows for a seamless end user experience.</p><h3>Packaging it as a browser extension<a href="#packaging-it-as-a-browser-extension" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The final piece of the puzzle is packaging up the Next.js application for use as a browser extension. Having to manually open privanote.xyz everytime you want to take notes is a bit cumbersome, so the idea is to override the "new tab" page of your browser. That means pressing CMD (or CTRL) + N will open up PrivaNote, allowing you to jott down thoughts without thinking twice about it.</p><p>Here's our script we used to do this:</p><p>The most interesting lines are the ones that contain <code>_next</code> and <code>next</code>. Chrome won't let browser extensions import JavaScript files that start with an underscore. So trying to add a <code>&lt;script src="/_next/a.js" /&gt;</code> tag won't work out of the box, we need to replace <code>_next</code> with <code>next</code> (or any string you prefer). The <code>sed</code> command shown here works on Mac OS but you might have to fiddle with it if you're using a different OS.</p><h3>Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Thanks for taking the time to checkout this tutorial, as we said PrivaNote is one of the first applications built on top of Portabella so we'll continue to improve documentation and APIs as we go and discover what's useful to people.</p><p>If you have any questions feel free to reach on Twitter to us <a href="https://twitter.com/portabellaio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@portabellaio</a> or via email <a href="mailto:hello@portabella.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hello@portabella.io</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>You founded win.rar GmbH as a student. Who or what encouraged your entrepreneurial spirit?</h3><p>We started win.rar together with my cousin Öncül Kaya during a time both of us were in the first semesters of our studies. For me it was a logical continuation of my career which had began as a coach and manager at a small basketball club in Germany. I had been actively promoting our club and already at the age of 17 I was actively doing all classical work in marketing and PR. After finishing school which is 13 years in Germany plus an extra year in USA and the mandatory military or civil service I did a two year training to become a banker. That makes a total education of 17 years. Following banking I worked part-time in a company that was consulting banks on IT projects and then I moved into a company that was a local internet service provider (ISP) and Software Development company. As Marketing Assistant and later Marketing Manager, one of my tasks there was to create business around WinRAR which the company was distributing in Germany and USA.</p><p>After leaving the company I was approached by Ron Dwight the publisher of WinRAR and asked if we would like to sell WinRAR in Germany.</p><p>I thought that it would be wrong to engage in a business which would be in direct competition to my former employer and so we tried to build an international business around WinRAR aimed at consulting Ron Dwight on how to improve WinRAR, the distribution network and the brand of the product.</p><p>It was intended to generate us a little side income until the end of university.</p><p>We basically had two underlying ideas for starting our own company rather than just acting as employees or contractors:</p><p>A) We wanted to have an official business structure with a GmbH which is German for limited liability company. However the GmbH back then required a minimum capital of 25’000 Euros, so it enjoyed the respect of people since not every entrepreneur is able to put that kind of money into a bank account and is willing to risk it.</p><p>We were able to convince my father to loan the money and agreed internally not to touch the money except for paying the expenses related to registering a company. &nbsp;</p><p>That way we were planning to be able to act as &nbsp;respected entrepreneurs without risking not being able to pay back what we owed my father.</p><p>B) We wanted to prepare a future brand-transfer by putting a well recognized name on our business that everybody would know and which would give us credibility in the future in case we would move away from WinRAR.</p><p>So I asked Ron Dwight if he would allow us to call the company win.rar GmbH. He agreed with a sentence I never forgot:</p><blockquote><p>“Of course you can use the brand for your company. It will make sure you commit yourself 100% to WinRAR because you would not be able to conduct any other business under that company name.”</p></blockquote><p>It was a price we are very willing to pay. We did not have much to lose and we had a feeling that if we did our job well for a couple of years (until we are done with our studies and could commit full-time), we could convince Ron to retire and have us continue the business for him.</p><p>So to sum it up, we were young and went for an opportunity that we believed was going to fund our expenses while going to school and we felt we had an opportunity to create our own work-place when done. The costs and risks seemed very low compared to the outlook it gave us.</p><h3>Was anyone mentoring you at the very beginning of your career?</h3><p>It depends on when you define the beginning of my career. Prior to starting with win.rar I did a two year training program with the Deutsche Bank, where all we did was being monitored and coached. It was an incredible schooling or mentoring experience in all areas of business. Before I was very lucky to have very good teachers when going to school. Especially in Mathematics I was always challenged by a long line of great teachers. The same is true for my language teachers. It was only much later that I realized how valuable the lessons were that I was taught in school. After the training and before starting with WinRAR I was lucky to have Andreas Messer teach me the tricks of the trade in the consulting business. Then during the founding period I was lucky to consider Ron Dwight as a mentor. He was always happy to answer any questions I had. However after he passed away I did not have additional help except from our peers.</p><h3>What was the initial idea of win.rar GmbH? Was it difficult for it to make a success?</h3><p>In addition to the above, the basic instrument to build was a multi-lingual website. Since at that time I more or less spoke five languages, we built a simple site in English, German, Turkish, French and Spanish. I had managed to buy <a href="http://www.win-rar.com/">www.win-rar.com</a> for approximately 500 Euros from a domain-grabber and with the contract that allowed us to sell WinRAR we had put together five &nbsp;puzzle pieces:</p><ol><li>Distribution rights to a Product</li><li>A website containing the product name</li><li>A company name containing the product name</li><li>A website with an international appearance &nbsp;around the product</li><li>The necessary infrastructure (registered company and bank account) to be able to conduct business</li></ol><p>I would love to say that it was very difficult, but we were surprised by how easy it was. A couple of days after we had put the website online, we already received a fax with the first order. &nbsp;The next day the second fax came in. It felt like we had struck a mine on the first try, but what followed was more than anything we had imagined.</p><h3>What was going on with your job after Ron Dwight passed away?</h3><p>Things happened extremely fast around Easter in 2002. This is just weeks after starting the company on 20.02.2002. Ron passed away hours after explaining to me how we need to operate his platform in order to create license keys for the first two orders we had received. So basically we had only successfully created a single user license and one multi-user license when our entire business structure faced potentially becoming obsolete.</p><p>We had no idea who would follow Ron. We had no idea if that person or organisation would respect the agreements we had made with Ron, some of which had been verbal. We had no idea how we would be able to provide the product to our customers if his platform should stop working. So basically I was not only very sad about having lost a respected business partner and mentor but I was also afraid that everything we had built could become obsolete.</p><p>So we made a decision to deviate from our plan to not touch any of the money and instead use whatever we need to fly to the funeral, talk to the family and find out if there is any opportunity to continue our business. We had a head-start over anybody else including the developers around WinRAR because -as I only found out later- I was the person most involved with Ron. In order to set up everything I had pretty much been calling him on a weekly basis for months and when he passed away, his girlfriend did not know who else to call but me, so it was up to me to inform Ron’s business partners about his death.</p><p>So after booking the flight I asked some former colleagues for an emergency meeting and we mapped out a concept based on the limited knowledge we had. We agreed that they would try to develop a system to handle orders while I talk to the family and we would offer them to continue the business.</p><p>However the family was not interested in getting involved. We were able to make a deal with the creditors, with the distributors and developers and Ron’s family which made everybody happy but meant a load of work for us since it meant us being the future exclusive publisher of WinRAR taking over a business which we had only very limited knowledge of.</p><p>I quickly realized that I could not go on with school, but the healthy business we had been able to quickly create from almost nothing in just a few weeks allowed us to pay back my father and was so much more interesting than school that it was fun to spend around 100 hours per week on building win.rar to what it is now.</p><h3>Does WinRAR make life easier?</h3><p>I absolutely believe so. It was one of the reasons we got involved with it. We feel that it is a useful tool for people who either have limited bandwidth or limited storage. While today such restrictions are no longer the main reason for use of WinRAR, we still offer the most convenient way of sharing files and folders and enhance that service with safe encryption, repair functions and other features that allow ease of use when it comes to archiving your data.</p><p>Surely there are thousands of ways today to handle data, but if you are concerned about privacy and reliability, we feel confident to say that there is still no better way than using WinRAR to maintain your own data on your own system.</p><h3>There are a lot of jokes online about the WinRAR never ending trial period. What is your favorite joke about WinRAR? Do you have your own?</h3><p>Actually there are so many, it is hard to only chose one. Here is a selection:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrar-meme-1024x646.jpg?resize=640%2C403" alt="winrar-meme" width="640" height="403" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=640%2C967" alt="winrarmeme" width="640" height="967" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?w=650&amp;ssl=1 650w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=66%2C100&amp;ssl=1 66w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=132%2C200&amp;ssl=1 132w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=106%2C160&amp;ssl=1 106w, https://i1.wp.com/en.split-techcity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/02/winrarmeme.jpg?resize=212%2C320&amp;ssl=1 212w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lX_pF03vCSU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p>Our own jokes do not come close to these I think. But we would like to ask the community of crackers:</p><blockquote><p>“Why do you bother creating a cracked version of WinRAR? The trial period never ends…thank you very much for the free marketing you gave us. We will be forever grateful!”</p></blockquote><h3>There are only five people in your company. How did that make life different for you? Would you ever scale up?</h3><p>That is a tough one to answer. It will surely depend on the project. Having only few people around you has a lot of advantages. The biggest maybe is having to constantly prioritize and focus on the immediate needs. It keeps the management and the company very centered. Any new project may require more man-power and there is no reason to not scale up when the business/project appears to be very profitable. But we believe that just employing people for the sake of growing is not the way. We like to see it the other way. Do things manually first but then immediately decide if it is possible to cut repetitions and program to make things easier. If it makes money and there …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>This appendix serves as a cheat sheet for linear algebra. The subject is presented as a set of tools, their properties, and what you can use them for. If you’re interested in the theory behind all this, you can pick up any introductory linear algebra textbook.</p>
<p>The focus is exclusively 2D and 3D algebra, as that’s what’s required in this book.</p>
<h2 id="points"><a href="#points">Points</a></h2>
<p>A <em>point</em> represents a position within a coordinate system.</p>
<p>We represent a point as a sequence of numbers between parentheses—for example, <span>\((4, 3)\)</span>. We refer to points using capital letters, such as <span>\(P\)</span> or <span>\(Q\)</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the numbers in the point’s sequence is called a <em>coordinate</em>. The number of coordinates is the point’s <em>dimension</em>. A point with two coordinates is called a two-dimensional, or 2D, point.</p>
<p>The order of the numbers is important; <span>\((4, 3)\)</span> is not the same as <span>\((3, 4)\)</span>. By convention, the coordinates are called <span>\(x\)</span> and <span>\(y\)</span> in 2D, and <span>\(x\)</span>, <span>\(y\)</span>, and <span>\(z\)</span> in 3D; so the point <span>\((4, 3)\)</span> has an <span>\(x\)</span> coordinate of <span>\(4\)</span>, and a <span>\(y\)</span> coordinate of <span>\(3\)</span>. Figure&nbsp;A-1 shows <span>\(P\)</span>, a 2D point with coordinates <span>\((4, 3)\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-1: The 2D point P has coordinates (4, 3)." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-points.png"><figcaption>Figure A-1: The 2D point <em>P</em> has coordinates (4, 3).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can also refer to specific coordinates of a point using a subscript, like <span>\(P_x\)</span> or <span>\(Q_y\)</span>. So the point <span>\(P\)</span> can also be written as <span>\((P_x, P_y, P_z)\)</span> when convenient.</p>
<h2 id="vectors"><a href="#vectors">Vectors</a></h2>
<p>A <em>vector</em> represents the difference between two points. Intuitively, imagine a vector as an arrow that connects a point to another point; alternatively, think of it as the instructions to get from one point to another.</p>
<h3 id="representing-vectors"><a href="#representing-vectors">Representing Vectors</a></h3>
<p>We represent a vector as a set of numbers between parentheses, and refer to them using a capital letter. This is the same representation we use for points, so we add a small arrow on top to remember they’re vectors and not points. For example, <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> is a vector, which we might decide to call <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span>. Figure&nbsp;A-2 shows two equal vectors, <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-2: The vectors \vec{A} and \vec{B} are equal. Vectors don’t have a position." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vectors.png"><figcaption>Figure A-2: The vectors <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span> are equal. Vectors don’t have a position.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Despite sharing their representation with points, vectors don’t represent or have a position; they are, after all, the <em>difference</em> between two positions. When you have a diagram like Figure&nbsp;A-2, you have to draw vectors somewhere; but the vectors <span>\(\vec{A}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{B}\)</span> are equal, because they represent the same displacement.</p>
<p>In addition, the point <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> and the vector <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> are unrelated. Sure, the vector <span>\((2, 1)\)</span> goes from <span>\((0, 0)\)</span> to <span>\((2, 1)\)</span>, but it’s equally true that it goes from, say, <span>\((5, 5)\)</span> to <span>\((7, 6)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Vectors are characterized by their <em>direction</em> (the angle in which they point) and their <em>magnitude</em> (how long they are).</p>
<p>The direction can be further decomposed into <em>orientation</em> (the slope of the line they’re on) and <em>sense</em> (which of the possible two ways along that line they point). For example, a vector pointing right and a vector pointing left both have the same horizontal orientation, but they have the opposite sense. However, we rarely make this distinction throughout the book.</p>
<h3 id="vector-magnitude"><a href="#vector-magnitude">Vector Magnitude</a></h3>
<p>You can compute the magnitude of a vector from its coordinates. The magnitude is also called the <em>length</em> or <em>norm</em> of the vector. It’s denoted by putting the vector between vertical pipes, as in <span>\(|\vec{V}|\)</span>, and it’s computed as follows:</p>
<p><span>\[|\vec{V}| = \sqrt{{V_x}^2 + {V_y}^2 + {V_z}^2}\]</span></p>
<p>A vector with a magnitude equal to <span>\(1.0\)</span> is called a <em>unit vector</em>.</p>
<h2 id="point-and-vector-operations"><a href="#point-and-vector-operations">Point and Vector Operations</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve defined points and vectors, let’s explore what we can do with them.</p>
<h3 id="subtracting-points"><a href="#subtracting-points">Subtracting Points</a></h3>
<p>A vector is the difference between two points. In other words, you can subtract two points and get a vector:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V} = P - Q\]</span></p>
<p>In this case you can think of <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> as “going” from <span>\(Q\)</span> to <span>\(P\)</span>, as in Figure&nbsp;A-3.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-3: The vector \vec{V} is the difference between P and Q." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-point-diff.png"><figcaption>Figure A-3: The vector <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> is the difference between <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Algebraically, you subtract each of the coordinates separately:</p>
<p><span>\[(V_x, V_y, V_z) = (P_x, P_y, P_z) - (Q_x, Q_y, Q_z) = (P_x - Q_x, P_y - Q_y, P_z - Q_z)\]</span></p>
<h3 id="adding-a-point-and-a-vector"><a href="#adding-a-point-and-a-vector">Adding a Point and a Vector</a></h3>
<p>We can rewrite the equation above coordinate by coordinate:</p>
<p><span>\[V_x = P_x - Q_x\]</span> <span>\[V_y = P_y - Q_y\]</span> <span>\[V_z = P_z - Q_z\]</span></p>
<p>These are just numbers, so all the usual rules apply. This means you can do this:</p>
<p><span>\[Q_x + V_x = P_x\]</span> <span>\[Q_y + V_y = P_y\]</span> <span>\[Q_z + V_z = P_z\]</span></p>
<p>And grouping the coordinates again,</p>
<p><span>\[Q + \vec{V} = P\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, you can add a vector to a point and get a new point. This makes intuitive and geometric sense; given a starting position (a point) and a displacement (a vector), you end up in a new position (another point). Figure&nbsp;A-4 presents an example.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-4: Adding \vec{V} to Q gives us P." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-point-plus-vector.png"><figcaption>Figure A-4: Adding <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> to <em>Q</em> gives us <em>P</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="adding-vectors"><a href="#adding-vectors">Adding Vectors</a></h3>
<p>You can add two vectors. Geometrically, imagine putting one vector “after” another, as in Figure&nbsp;A-5.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-5: Adding two vectors. Addition is commutative. Remember, vectors don’t have a position." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-plus-vector.png"><figcaption>Figure A-5: Adding two vectors. Addition is commutative. Remember, vectors don’t have a position.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, vector addition is commutative—that is, the order of the operands doesn’t matter. In the diagram, <span>\(\vec{V} + \vec{W} = \vec{W} + \vec{V}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you add the coordinates individually:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V} + \vec{W} = (V_x, V_y, V_z) + (W_x, W_y, W_z) = (V_x + W_x, V_y + W_y, V_z + W_z)\]</span></p>
<h3 id="multiplying-a-vector-by-a-number"><a href="#multiplying-a-vector-by-a-number">Multiplying a Vector by a Number</a></h3>
<p>You can multiply a vector by a number. This is called the <em>scalar product</em>. This makes the vector shorter or longer, as you can see in Figure&nbsp;A-6.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-6: Multiplying a vector by a number" src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-scaling.png"><figcaption>Figure A-6: Multiplying a vector by a number</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If the number is negative, the vector will point the other way; this means it changes its sense, and therefore its direction. But multiplying a vector by a number never changes its orientation—that is, it will remain along the same line.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you multiply the coordinates individually:</p>
<p><span>\[k \cdot \vec{V} = k \cdot (V_x, V_y, V_z) = (k \cdot V_x, k \cdot V_y, k \cdot V_z)\]</span></p>
<p>You can also divide a vector by a number. Just like with numbers, dividing by <span>\(k\)</span> is equivalent to multiplying by <span>\(\frac{1}{k}\)</span>. As usual, division by zero doesn’t work.</p>
<p>One of the applications of vector multiplication and division is to <em>normalize</em> a vector—that is, to turn it into a unit vector. This changes the magnitude of the vector to <span>\(1.0\)</span>, but doesn’t change its other properties. To do this, we just need to divide the vector by its length:</p>
<p><span>\[\vec{V_{normalized}} = \frac{\vec{V}}{|\vec{V}|}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="multiplying-vectors"><a href="#multiplying-vectors">Multiplying Vectors</a></h3>
<p>You can multiply a vector by another vector. Interestingly, there are many ways in which you can define an operation like this. We’re going to focus on two kinds of multiplication that are useful to us: the dot product and the cross product.</p>
<h4 id="dot-product"><a href="#dot-product">Dot Product</a></h4>
<p>The <em>dot product</em> between two vectors (also called the <em>inner product</em>) gives you a number. It’s expressed using the dot operator, as in <span>\(\vec{V} \cdot \vec{W}\)</span>. It’s also written between angle braces, as in <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>Algebraically, you multiply the coordinates individually and add them up:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle = \langle(V_x, V_y, V_z), (W_x, W_y, W_z)\rangle = V_x \cdot W_x + V_y \cdot W_y + V_z \cdot W_z\]</span></p>
<p>Geometrically, the dot product of <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> is related to their lengths, and to the angle <span>\(\alpha\)</span> between them. The exact formula neatly ties together linear algebra and trigonometry:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle = |\vec{V}| \cdot |\vec{W}| \cdot cos(\alpha)\]</span></p>
<p>Either of these formulas help us see that the dot product is commutative (that is, <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> = <span>\(\langle \vec{W}, \vec{V} \rangle\)</span>), and that it’s distributive with respect to a scalar product (that is, $k ,  = k ,  $).</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of the second formula is that if <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> are perpendicular, then <span>\(cos(\alpha) = 0\)</span>, and therefore <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> is also zero. If <span>\(\vec{V}\)</span> and <span>\(\vec{W}\)</span> are unit vectors, then <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle\)</span> is always between <span>\(-1.0\)</span> and <span>\(1.0\)</span>, with <span>\(1.0\)</span> meaning they’re equal and <span>\(-1.0\)</span> meaning they’re opposite.</p>
<p>The second formula also suggests the dot product can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors:</p>
<p><span>\[\alpha = cos^{-1} \left( \frac{\langle \vec{V}, \vec{W} \rangle}{|\vec{V}| \cdot |\vec{W}|} \right)\]</span></p>
<p>Note that the dot product of a vector with itself, <span>\(\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle\)</span>, reduces to the square of its length:</p>
<p><span>\[\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle = {V_x}^2 + {V_y}^2 + {V_z}^2 = {|\vec{V}|}^2\]</span></p>
<p>This suggests another way to compute the length of a vector, as the square root of its dot product with itself:</p>
<p><span>\[|\vec{V}| = \sqrt{\langle \vec{V}, \vec{V} \rangle}\]</span></p>
<h4 id="cross-product"><a href="#cross-product">Cross Product</a></h4>
<p>The cross product between two vectors gives you another vector. It’s expressed using the cross operator, as in <span>\(\vec{V} \times \vec{W}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them. In this book we only use the cross product on 3D vectors, shown in Figure&nbsp;A-7.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Figure A-7: The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them." src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/images/aa-vector-cross-product.png"><figcaption>Figure A-7: The cross product of two vectors is a vector perpendicular to both of them.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The computation is a bit more involved than the dot product. If <span>\(\vec{R} = \vec{V} \times \vec{W}\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span>\[R_x = V_y \cdot W_z - V_z \cdot W_y\]</span> <span>\[R_y = V_x \cdot W_z - V_z \cdot W_x\]</span> <span>\[R_z = V_x \cdot W_y - V_y \cdot W_x\]</span></p>
<p>The cross product is not commutative. Specifically, <span>\(\vec{V} \times \vec{W} = -(\vec{W} \times \vec{V})\)</span>.</p>
<p>We use the cross product to compute the <em>normal vector</em> of a surface—that is, a unit vector perpendicular to the surface. To do this, we take two vectors on the surface, calculate their cross product, and normalize the result.</p>
<h2 id="matrices"><a href="#matrices">Matrices</a></h2>
<p>A <em>matrix</em> is a rectangular array of numbers. For the purposes of this book, matrices represent <em>transformations</em> that can be applied to points or vectors, and we refer to them with a capital letter, such as <span>\(M\)</span>. This is the same way we refer to points, but it will be clear by the context whether we’re talking about a matrix or a point.</p>
<p>A matrix is characterized by its size in terms of rows and columns. For example, this is a <span>\(4 \times 3\)</span> matrix:</p></div></div>

		<p><b>Abstract.</b> I extended the <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime/">animation-from-a-single-image neural network system I created in 2019</a> so that the characters can make more types of facial expressions. While the old system can only open/close the eyes and the mouth, this new version affords more eye/mouth shapes and can control the eyebrows and the irises. They allow a character to show various emotions and give more convincing impression of speech.</p>

		<h2>1 &nbsp; Motivation</h2>		

		<p>With the goal of making it easier to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_YouTuber">virtual YouTuber</a> (VTuber), in 2019, I created a <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime">neural network system</a> that can animate the face of any existing anime character, given only an image of it. The system, however, cannot yet be considered practical for becoming a VTuber. The most important shortcoming is that it can only close the eyes and mouth, robbing the character the ability to make most facial expressions. Characters used by professional VTubers, on the other hand, can deform the eyebrows, eyelids, irises, and mouth into various shapes. My goal in this article is to improve my system's expressiveness by increasing the types of movements it can produce.</p>

		<h2>2 &nbsp; Summary of Approach</h2>

		<p>My neural network system takes two inputs. First is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_shot">head shot</a> of a character looking straight at the viewer, and second is a six-dimensional <i>pose vector</i> that specifies the pose the user wants the character to take. It outputs another image of the same character taking the specified pose. By varying the pose vector over time, the character can be animated. It can perform six types of movements because the pose vector is six-dimensional. However, excluding rotating the face, it can only closes its eyes and mouth.</p>

		<p>The system poses a given character in two steps, each carried out by its own separate subnetwork. The <i>face morpher</i> closes the eyes and the mouth, and the <i>face rotator</i> rotates the face.</p>

	                </td>
	            </tr>
	        </tbody></table>
	    

	    <p>To increase types of movement, I started by preparing larger datasets. From the <a href="https://pkhungun.github.io/talking-head-anime/index.html#dataset">collection of approximately 8,000 3D models</a> I collected for my last system, I identified 39 common movements of facial parts and generated new datasets containing them. (You can see the list of movements <a href="https://pkhungurn.github.io/talking-head-anime-2/full.html#face-params">here</a>.) The movements encompass all the four movable facial features (eyebrows, eyelids, irises, and mouth) that can be observed in industrial characters. The size of the pose vector increased from 6 to 42 as a result <a href="#fn_pose_vector_length">[footnote]</a>.</p>

	    

	    <p>To deal with larger pose vectors, I propose a new architecture for the face morpher network, the overview of which is depicted in Figure 2.2.</p>

	            </tr>
	        </tbody></table>
	    

	    <p>The new face morpher has two subnetworks: the <b>eyebrow morpher</b> and the <b>eye &amp; mouth morpher</b>, with each network deforming the organ(s) in its name. The pose vector is divided into parts that can be fed into the relevant subnetworks.</p>

	    <h3>2.1 &nbsp; Eyebrow Morpher</h3>

	    <p>The eyebrow morpher first segments out the eyebrows with a dedicated subnetwork called the <b>eyebrow segmenter</b>. It then uses another subnetwork called the <b>eyebrow warper</b> to deform eyebrow and then composite the result back to the original image.</p>

	    <table>
	            <tbody><tr>

	    <p>The two networks have similar structures. It contains an encoder-decoder network that turns the input image(s) and the (optional) pose vector into an intermediate feature representation, which is then used to perform several image manipulation steps. I employ three types of image manipulation, each encapsulated into a reusable neural network unit.

	    </p><ol>
	    	<li><b>Partial image change</b>. The feature tensor is used to produce an alpha mask and another image that represents changes to the original image. The mask and the change image are then used to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha blending</a> with the input image to partially modify it. I take this step from the ECCV 2018 paper by Pumarola et al., which successfully applies it to alter facial expressions in human photos <a href="#fn_pumarola_2018">[2018]</a>.</li>

	    	<li><b>Combining</b>. The feature tensor is used to produce an alpha mask, which is then used to combine two images through alpha blending.</li>

	    	<li><b>Warping.</b> The feature tensor is transformed into an <b>appearance flow</b>, a map which tells, for each pixel of the output, which input image pixel to copy from <a href="#fn_zhou_2016">[Zhou et al. 2016]</a>. The appearance flow is then used to warp another image as it tells where each pixel should be moved to.</li>
	    </ol>
	    
	    

	   	<p>The eyebrow segmenter does its job with two partial image changes. The eyebrow warper deforms the extracted eyebrows with a warp and a partial image change. It then combines them back to the face image. Their architectures are given in Figure 2.4 and 2.5.</p>

			<b>Figure 2.5</b> Architecture of the eyebrow warper.
		</p>

		<p>During research, I discovered that it was very important to process the eyebrows separately from other facial features. Network architectures that used the same network to morph all facial features blurred the eyebrows after morphing them. By having separate networks morph the eyebrows after segmenting them out, I introduced a strong bias to preserve the eyebrow pixels, yielding crisp results.</p>

		<h3>2.2 &nbsp; Eye &amp; Mouth Morpher</h3>

	    <p>The eye &amp; mouth morpher has a similar architecture to the previous two networks. After passing the input image (the output of the eyebrow morpher) and the relevant part of the pose vector to an encoder-decoder network, it performs the following image manipulation steps:
		</p><ol>
			<li>a warp to deform the mouth and the irises,</li>
			<li>a partial image change to retouch the output of the last step, and</li>
			<li>another partial image change to deform the eyelids.</li>
		</ol>

			<b>Figure 2.7</b> Architecture of the eye &amp; mouth morpher.
		</p>

		<p>The above rather complicated process was a result of my iterating on the architecture. The first warping step is required to preserve high-frequency details of the irises. If partial image change were used, iris patterns drawn by artists would be lost.</p>

		</p>
	
		

		<p>The last step is necessary to produce artifact-free closed eyelids. If I were to deform the eyelids together with other facial features, they would be covered by the first warping step. I discovered that this led to small lines near the eyes being smeared, and the eyelids would be blemished as a result.</p>

		
		<p><b>Figure 2.9</b> The effect of processing the eyelids with a partial image change in a separate step. Notice the blemish produced by the architecture with warping. It is the result of the network's dragging the eyelid down and thereby smearing the small line inside the ground truth's red box. My proposed architecture simply fills the space with a solid color, yielding an artifact-free image.

		<h2>3 &nbsp; Results</h2>

		<p>I applied my system to 200 images of VTubers and related characters to generate a short video clip for each, and I put all the videos together in the <a href="#eyecatcher">eyecatcher</a>. You can watch the individual videos in the figure below.</p>

		<p>Below is a selection of characters making the 7 facial expressions shown at the beginning of the article.</p>
	</div><div>

		<p>The above figure demonstrates the versatility of my system. It could handle both male and female characters with very different eye and face shapes. It sensibly deformed the eyes even when partially occluded by hair or seen through translucent glasses. It hallucinates plausible mouth shapes in cases where the input image has a closed mouth while my previous system would just leave the mouth as is.</p>

		<p>Another strengths of my system is its flexibility: I can combine it with any source of pose parameters. I thus use it to create a number of content creation tools and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidding">fanvids</a>.</p>

		<p>First, I created a desktop application that allows the user to manipulate an anime character's facial expression and face rotation by dragging sliders. The resulting image can be saved for later use.</p>

		</p>

		<p>Second, I wrote a program that converts motions authored for 3D models into sequences to pose parameters, allowing me use them to drive 2D character illustrations. With this tool, I created 4 music videos.</p>

		<p>Yesterday, I accidentally built a chat app. Surprisingly, it wasn't the first time it happened.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/colors.jpeg" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Before I tell you how Hackernews turned (this blog's) <a href="https://blog.repl.it/__logs">HTTP logs</a> into chat, let me tell you about how a 12-year old user hacked the first chat app and community space on Replit right into a Python REPL.</p>
<p>In 2018 we didn't know we had such a strong community of tinkerers. We knew people make games with Replit and share it with other people. But we didn't realize we'd already been a Schelling point for young hackers. </p>
<p>One day, <a href="https://repl.it/@pyelias">@pyelias</a> created a post on our support forum saying he built a Chatroom and linked to a repl. I thought it would be a simple chatbot or something similar because I hadn't seen internet-based apps on the platform until that point. We had just opened up <a href="https://blog.repl.it/internet-access">internet access</a> to everyone, but we didn't support web hosting or any advanced features Replit has today. It was a very constrained environment.</p>
<p>When I opened up Pyelias' Chatroom, I saw a vibrant community. It was mindblowing. It was like suddenly discovering the chair you'd been sitting on was made of gold. The community was not only fun, but it was also helpful, wholesome, and inviting.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/chatroom.png" alt="chatroom screenshot"></p>
<p>The way the Chatroom worked: the repl acted as a terminal client. When you run the code, it connected to a remote database and pulled for the latest messages. The entire application logic was on the client. Over the next few days, I saw rapid iteration. It went from a simple Chatroom to something like IRC. It had rooms, private messages, colors, muting, and because it's on top of the Python repl, it also had support for inline code evaluation. </p>
<p>As the room grew, it naturally had problems with spam and bad actors. So it grew moderation features, filters, etc. Other users started contributing ideas and ways to improve it. It was magnificent and a model for making Replit a magical place for serendipitous computer explorations. </p>
<p>From there, we grew our community features, and today we have a fantastic <a href="https://repl.it/talk">forum</a> where people share apps and find other people to work with. In a future post, I'll tell how they built a fully programmable "Stonk" market. </p>
<h2 id="hackernews-chats-in-http-logs">Hackernews chats in http logs</h2>
<p>In our blog's <a href="https://repl.it/@util/replit-blog#posts/internet-of-fun.md">repl</a> (where the app is hosted), I was writing something when I saw the HTTP logs in the console accelerate. For some reason, I knew it was hackernews, so I went there and saw <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25991988">the post</a> on the front page. I commented on it, saying that people can see the log stream by going to <a href="https://blog.repl.it/__logs">https://blog.repl.it/__logs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25993765">andrewxhonson on Hackernews</a> visited the logs and saw an opportunity to chat. Because the blog was logging all the GET requests, you can effectively send "messages" to the logs by going to a path on the website (even if it doesn't exist). So for example, <code>https://blog.repl.it/hi%20my%20name%20is%20fred</code> resulted in a <code>GET hello my name is fred</code> log message. Now you have a streaming website that anyone can drop messages into -- i.e., a chat room!</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hackernews found our blog logs and are new chatting in the HTTP requests. <a href="https://t.co/jYgwmMJRDP">https://t.co/jYgwmMJRDP</a> <a href="https://t.co/OkujyM8s3N">pic.twitter.com/OkujyM8s3N</a></p>— Amjad Masad (@amasad) <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1356344510465286144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2021</a></blockquote> 

<p>I tweeted about it, and someone posted it on HN as a separate post, so it started growing. At first, people couldn't tell that Replit logs is a terminal complete with support for ANSI escape codes. I dropped that hint on HN comment, and they were off to the races. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/colors.jpeg" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>However, if you don't send an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">ANSI reset</a> after your message, you're styling all the subsequent messages in the stream. I fixed that by adding a reset before each log message. I was coding live, so when I restarted the app, it broke and logged the syntax error to the console, which is actually the chatroom, and my users saw it. Not only do I have users on my accidental chatroom, they're also watching me work live and seeing my embarrassingly sloppy code (incidentally, that's why I love repl-driven coding you see the mistakes you make live and fix them quickly).</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/chat_style.png" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Yesterday, I had many meetings (I don't code full-time anymore, sadly) so I had to fix the Chatroom (I mean blog logs lol) incrementally between calls. Naturally, with growth came the bad actors. Someone started posting 10s of thousands of messages and spamming the chat. My first reaction was: "wow it's amazing how resilient this webserver hosted on a single container!" Then I thought about implementing rate-limiting and profanity filters. However, I had a meeting in the next 5 minutes. Instead, I put Cloudflare in front of the blog, and with a couple of firewall rules, the blocking started! </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/blocking.png" alt="colored chat screenshot"></p>
<p>Finally, before the day was over, I noticed that a <a href="https://repl.it/@ConnorBrewster/blog-chat">handful</a> of <a href="http://repl.chat/">clients</a> for the chat has emerged, and things thing has a life of their own. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/client.png" alt="cloudflare rate limiting"></p>
<p>Even as I'm writing this post in the repl, I can see the chat continue. There are now JSON messages and some weird protocol that's going on. Are people building apps on it? I'm sure that will happen before the end of the week. After all, it's a full terminal, and you can make entire UIs on it. </p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/chat/more.jpeg" alt="json messages"></p>
<p>I'm writing this story because we want to show the world that computers &amp; the internet are still fun. Hacking, tinkering, and weird experiments continue to happen on platforms like Replit. Because every repl on Replit is a full computer that comes with access to the network, a database, storage, and access to its code, user profiles, and other primitives, it makes it inherently amenable to serendipity and accidental software interactions. </p>
<p>I invite everyone to <a href="https://repl.it/">sign up</a> and check out our <a href="https://repl.it/talk">community</a> and see what fun, weird things people are <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">building</a>. Even if you're not interested in Replit the "online IDE" you might find that Replit, the "weird internet computer" will make you giddy programming (again).</p>

<p><strong>1. Close your business while it’s working</strong></p>

<p>I opened my first business right out of high school. I had a few thousand dollars saved up and I wanted to start a business. I found a tiny office space on a busy road and shook hands with the landlord. My Dad helped me make a sign using a piece of wood and a vinyl sticker. I purchased two computer systems and set them up on folding tables. I purchased a desk and a chair and put those in the back of my space, like a small used car salesman. Suddenly, I was selling custom built computer systems using off the shelf parts.</p>

<p>A few months later I got a call from my high school. I told the caller what I was up to and he informed me that the school would receive a small grant because I was working in the industry I had aspired to less than a year after graduation.</p>

<p>Then, I fell in love. No, that’s not right, I was in love before I had even started this. But, the conversation had turned to marriage and children. The business was working okay, but I didn’t think I was doing well enough to support a family. I needed a real job making real money. After working in the store for just nine months, I applied at a local tech company and walked away from my little business.</p>

<p>Three months later I would hire an accountant to do my taxes. I handed him a shoe box full of receipts and invoices and let him figure it out. When he handed me my first <em>Schedule C</em> I nearly hit the floor. I was showing a business loss that was more money than I had ever imagined. He explained that I would be able to write this loss off, in parts, over the next seven years.</p>

<p>But, remember, I had come into this business with only a few thousand dollars. If I had <em>lost</em> that kind of money, I had also <em>made</em> that money to lose. If I were paying attention, I think the business would have been profitable. But, I wasn’t paying attention, and the business had closed months ago.</p>

<p><strong>2. Get a cease and desist from your own employer</strong></p>

<p>Remember that Tech job I landed to make real money? Turns out, that was a good move. The company I joined was Iomega and they were roaring. They had recently released the Zip drive and had gone from 100k in annual revenue to a two billion dollar company. With that kind of growth, money and promotions were all around me. I loved the job and the people I was working with. I was climbing the corporate ladder and loving it.</p>

<p>Iomega also made the higher end Jaz drive, and all of us had one (or two) on our desks. Some of my co-workers were complaining about a problem though. The Jaz drive would spin-down, after two minutes or so, to conserve energy. The next time you accessed the drive, it took 20 or 30 seconds for it to spin up.</p>

<p>I had access to an internal engineering manual for the drive, so I dived in. I concluded that the drives were designed to spin down mostly to save energy. Based on the numbers I had, I figured they would last more than 10 years, even if they were running 24/7. But, there was no way to configure them to stay spinning. The sleep was built into the firmware of the drive itself.</p>

<p>That’s when I got the idea for my first Shareware program. It was a simple Windows utility that I called JazAwake. It would write a tiny file to the Jaz drive every 60 seconds and then delete it. The file was just big enough that it would flush it to disk. Because the drive was being written too every minute or so, it would no longer spin down.</p>

<p>The program was popular both inside the company and out. All of my co-workers were using it and people were starting to pay to register it.</p>

<p>Then I got a letter from one of the lawyers at Iomega. It was addressed to my software company. It was a cease and desist asking me to stop using the Jaz trademark and remove JazAwake from the Internet. At first, I laughed. How can you remove a piece of software from the Internet? That’s impossible. But, nothing short of that would stop them from suing me.</p>

<p>Luckily, they didn’t realize I also worked there, or I imagine I would have lost my job too.</p>

<p>I went to work creating my own cease and desist letter explaining what I had done and started mailing them to every organization that had written about or linked to my software. I had to send these letters to over a hundred different companies. I went back and forth with the lawyers at Iomega for about 6 months and when they could no longer find the software online, they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I stayed at Iomega for a couple more years and I created another popular Shareware program called ButtonWiz. When Iomega started to lose steam, I left for a smaller company.</p>

<p><strong>3. Close your side business and focus on the promise of becoming CEO</strong></p>

<p>I got a job at a small technology company that served only about 100 customers. But, the owner had created something useful and he was making enough money to pay for himself and another employee. He didn’t want to make too much profit, because that meant paying more taxes and quarterly tax paperwork. He would watch the books so that his profit was less than $4k per year. If we had made too much money for the year, by October or November, he would spend some of it on new things we needed for the office or employee bonuses. It worked out really well.</p>

<p>The owner was getting up there in age and he figured he would like to retire in another 10 years or so. None of his family was interested in the business he had built and he had no real plan to exit. So, he had the idea that he would hand the business to me at some point and I would continue to pay him well into retirement. He purchased a life insurance policy and set me as the beneficiary. If he died before he was able to retire, I could pay his family and continue to run the business.</p>

<p>ButtonWiz continued to get more and more popular and was now bringing in a few hundred dollars a month. One day the boss suggested that I stop working on my side projects and double-down at the office. So, I shelved work on ButtonWiz and let it wither away over the next few years while I focused on the company I worked for.</p>

<p>Now eight years into my Career here, the company had grown from the two of us to around ten employees. Among those employees a few family members had been introduced, but I was still employee number two. Then the boss dropped a bomb that didn’t completely surprise me. There were people in the family showing interest now and he had decided to keep the business in the family. I can’t blame him. One of the reasons I’ve always wanted to build a business is to support my family and, if it’s really successful, more of those around me. But, suddenly, my career felt like another job, so I started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>4. Break Googles TOS and accidentally commit click fraud while your at it</strong></p>

<p>Growing more and more frustrated with the stress of my job, I started to run. I would run at a park by my office every day on my lunch break. I also started watching my weight and I started writing software again.</p>

<p>I had tried a bunch of calorie trackers but logging all the specific foods I ate was too much for me. I decided to create a calorie tracker that was fast. I would just enter the number of calories I ate and the web app would timestamp them. No more looking up foods.</p>

<p>At the top of the app I created a search box and I pointed that to a webview that opened to Google. I modified the search a little by adding the word “calories” to the end of it. That way, I could search for something like “pizza” and it would return a set of results for “pizza calories”, often with the actual number of calories right there at the top. I also signed up for Google advertising and embedded a mobile ad unit on the page. I released it for the iPhone and published it free on the web app directory on Apple.com (the App Store didn’t exist yet).</p>

<p>The money started rolling in. Lots of users were downloading the app and using it and the ad revenue was crazy high. It made a ton of money for a couple weeks and then I started looking at my ad click rates. They were astronomical. In fact, my click through rate was so high, it had to be an error. I started digging in.</p>

<p>What I found is that the search box and the ad unit were in close proximity to each other and users were accidentally clicking on the ad when they were trying to enter calorie counts. Oops.</p>

<p>I adjusted the placement of the two UI elements to be far apart. While I was doing that, I found a piece of information in Google’s Terms of Service that said you weren’t allowed to alter the search term a user entered. I was relying on Google for all my income here, so I also updated my search box so that it didn’t add the word “calories”, even though it made the search results significantly less relevant. Hopefully users would learn to do that themselves.</p>

<p>When I released the new version, as you might expect, the ad revenue tanked. Nearly all of the advertising clicks were users clicking by mistake.</p>

<p><strong>5. Write a book about a platform that changes a lot</strong></p>

<p>Since I was writing software again, I decided to give Facebook Apps a try. The app setup process was complex and confusing so I started to take detailed notes. After creating a “Hello World” app, I followed my instructions again and repeated the process for something more interesting. I refined my notes as I went, creating several test apps along the way. When I got done, I realized I had enough information to teach other developers how to do this. At the time, the Facebook documentation was sparse and hard to find. I had learned most of it by trial and error. I was also interested in trying self publishing. So, I decided I would spend the next weekend formatting this into a small book and self-publishing it on Amazon.</p>

<p>The book was selling a few copies a week and was getting great reviews.</p>

<p>About three months later, the book suddenly started to get bad reviews. I opened the book and followed it myself. Facebook had updated the process and things were different now. I made new notes and figured out the new process and …</p></div></div>

    <blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There’s that sort of sense that many technical people will see or feel when you see something and you know what it could be, and you know it could be important, and you see companies just doing it wrong — there’s that powerful desire to fix it and do it right and show them sort of how it’s supposed to be done”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dIUBGf1RHU&amp;t=9m17s">John Carmack at GDC 2015</a>, in what’s likely to be the most reused quote on this blog.</p>

<p>I just bought Doom Eternal. Excited to see the download has completed I fired it up and.. nothing. Just a bunch of resolution changes, then nothing - not even an error message. I’m back to the desktop right where I started. My first go-to was the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/782330/announcements/detail/1806446683757378310">Doom Eternal support article on Steam</a>, where I was greeted with this gem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Issue: DOOM Eternal fails to launch or crashes while launching on my Laptop.
Resolution: We do not officially support laptop hardware. Laptops that conform to the supported hardware specifications may run DOOM Eternal. Make sure the laptop uses its dedicated GPU and that the laptop is plugged into power. (This may also help with some desktops that use motherboards that have integrated GPUs.)
For NVIDIA users, your NVIDIA driver needs to be setup to pick the dedicated GPU.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did happen to be using a laptop — a Razer Blade advanced model with a GeForce RTX 2080. It’s not like it’s an alien computer from outer space, and software shouldn’t have trouble running on a laptop versus a desktop. Let’s try to read between the lines and see how iD Software might be failing here. First there’s “Make sure the laptop uses its dedicated GPU” — most users aren’t technically inclined enough to know <em>how</em> to make sure the laptop does that, and in Doom Eternal’s case being powered by a Vulkan renderer means that at one point they need to be calling <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.html">vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices</a> to, ahem, enumerate the physical GPU devices on the system. Almost all hybrid systems will be using an Intel integrated GPU plus an NVIDIA or AMD discrete GPU — is this too hard to detect? Is a heuristic picking the non-Intel GPU when faced with two GPUs too much work? Such a heuristic would save Bethesda the effort of writing the above support message and quite a few support calls, and I’m not even going to touch upon lost sales. Direct3D users have <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgifactory-enumadapters">IDXGIFactory::EnumAdapters</a>, which does the same thing. There’s really no excuse for requiring that the user, every user, jump through hoops when GPU selection is something that can be done in a few lines of code on the application’s side.</p>

<p>As for the second part, “Make sure… that the laptop is plugged into power” — can’t someone just call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getsystempowerstatus">GetSystemPowerStatus</a> and display a warning? There’s no reason an app shouldn’t work on battery power (that’s pure madness if you ask me), but it’s reasonable to show a warning saying you’ll either drain your battery really fast or you’ll suffer decreased performance.</p>

<p>Later down in the same support document I came across another embarrassing answer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Issue: Game crashes on launch with two AMD GPUs installed.
Resolution: Issue is caused by having multiple monitors plugged into different GPUs. Plug both monitors into the primary GPU to fix.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously? There’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiadapter-enumoutputs">IDXGIAdapter::EnumOutputs</a>, and you can use the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0-wsi_extensions/html/vkspec.html#VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR">VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2</a> extension to map a Vulkan device’s LUID to a DXGI device’s LUID.</p>

<p>It seems like Doom Eternal’s code, as technically impressive as its core renderer is, seems to only work fine on the authors’ computers and nothing significantly different — if you even hook up your monitors differently you’re shit out of luck. There isn’t even any effort to detect the known-bad cases and show an error message, you just get a blank screen then back to the desktop and then have to go through the support document and figure out what might apply to your case. Even if you ignore the time saved for customers, the dollar-amount cost for Bethesda in terms of support effort makes detecting such situations financially worth it.</p>

<p>Fabian Giesen once wrote a <a href="https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/smart/">blog post</a> discussing the difference between intelligence and a high level of technical skill. There’s no doubt that the core tech in Doom Eternal is showcasing a level of technical skill unmatched by almost everyone else in the game development circles — but the end product, the thing that you can not inspect quality into as Harold F. Dodge once said, doesn’t seem like the work of someone very intelligent.</p>

<p>One of the biggest threats to a high quality end-product is highly skilled unintelligent people in a driver’s seat.</p>

    <p>I’ve spent a good deal of my professional life arguing against using protobuffers. They’re clearly written by amateurs, unbelievably ad-hoc, mired in gotchas, tricky to compile, and solve a problem that nobody but Google really has. If these problems of protobuffers remained quarantined in serialization abstractions, my complaints would end there. But unfortunately, the bad design of protobuffers is so persuasive that these problems manage to leak their way into your code as well.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hoc-and-built-by-amateurs">Ad-Hoc and Built By Amateurs</h2>
<p>Stop. Put away your email client that is half-way through writing me about how “Google is filled with the world’s best engineers,” and that “anything they build is, by definition, not built by amateurs.” I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>Let’s just get this out of the way. Full disclosure: I used to work at Google. It was the first (but unfortunately, not the last) place I ever used protobuffers. All of the problems I want to talk about today exist inside of Google’s codebase; it’s not just a matter of “using protobuffers wrong” or some such nonsense like that.</p>
<p>By far, the biggest problem with protobuffers is their terrible type-system. Fans of Java should feel right at home with protobuffers, but unfortunately, literally nobody considers Java to have a well-designed type-system. The dynamic typing guys complain about it being too stifling, while the static typing guys like me complain about it being too stifling without giving you any of the things you actually want in a type-system. Lose lose.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc-ness and the built-by-amateurs-itude go hand-in-hand. So much of the protobuffer spec feels bolted on as an afterthought that it clearly <em>was</em> bolted on as an afterthought. Many of its restrictions will make you stop, scratch your head and ask “wat?” But these are just symptoms of the deeper answer, which is this:</p>
<p>Protobuffers were obviously built by amateurs because they offer <em>bad solutions to widely-known and already-solved problems.</em></p>
<h3 id="no-compositionality">No Compositionality</h3>
<p>Protobuffers offer several “features”, but none of them see to work with one another. For example, look at the list of orthogonal-yet-constrained typing features that I found by skimming the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">documentation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> fields have dedicated syntax for their keys and values, but this isn’t used for any other types.</li>
<li>Despite <code>map</code> fields being able to be parameterized, no user-defined types can be. This means you’ll be stuck hand-rolling your own specializations of common data structures.</li>
<li><code>map</code> fields cannot be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map</code> keys <em>can</em> be <code>string</code>s, but <em>can not</em> be <code>bytes</code>. They also can’t be <code>enum</code>s, even though <code>enum</code>s are considered to be equivalent to integers everywhere else in the protobuffer spec.</li>
<li><code>map</code> values cannot be other <code>map</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>This insane list of restrictions is the result of unprincipled design choices and bolting on features after the fact. For example, <code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code> because rather than resulting in a coproduct type, instead the code generator will give you a product of mutually-exclusive optional fields. Such a transformation is only valid for a singular field (and, as we’ll see later, not even then.)</p>
<p>The restriction behind <code>map</code> fields being unable to be <code>repeated</code> is related, but shows off a different limitation of the type-system. Behind the scenes, a <code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> is desugared into something spiritually similar to <code>repeated Pair&lt;k,v&gt;</code>. And because <code>repeated</code> is a magical language keyword rather than a type in its own right, it doesn’t compose with itself.</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine for why an <code>enum</code> can’t be used as a <code>map</code> key.</p>
<p>What’s so frustrating about all of this is a little understanding of how modern type-systems work would be enough to <em>drastically simplify</em> the protobuffer spec and simultaneously <em>remove all of the arbitrary restrictions.</em></p>
<p>The solution is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make all fields in a message <code>required</code>. This makes messages <em>product types</em>.</li>
<li>Promote <code>oneof</code> fields to instead be standalone data types. These are <em>coproduct types</em>.</li>
<li>Give the ability to parameterize product and coproduct types by other types.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! These three features are all you need in order to define any possible piece of data. With these simpler pieces, we can re-implement the rest of the protobuffer spec in terms of them.</p>
<p>For example, we can rebuild <code>optional</code> fields:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">product Unit {</span>
<span id="cb1-2">  <span>// no fields</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3">}</span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">coproduct Optional&lt;t&gt; {</span>
<span id="cb1-6">  t    value = <span>0</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-7">  Unit unset = <span>1</span>;</span>
<span id="cb1-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Building <code>repeated</code> fields is simple too:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">coproduct List&lt;t&gt; {</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  Unit empty = <span>0</span>;</span>
<span id="cb2-3">  Pair&lt;t, List&lt;t&gt;&gt; cons = <span>1</span>;</span>
<span id="cb2-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the actual serialization logic is allowed to do something smarter than pushing linked-lists across the network—after all, <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/follow-the-denotation/">implementations and semantics don’t need to align one-to-one</a>.</p>
<h3 id="questionable-choices">Questionable Choices</h3>
<p>In the vein of Java, protobuffers make the distinction between <em>scalar</em> types and <em>message</em> types. Scalars correspond more-or-less to machine primitives—things like <code>int32</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>string</code>. Messages, on the other hand, are everything else. All library- and user-defined types are messages.</p>
<p>The two varieties of types have completely different semantics, of course.</p>
<p>Fields with scalar types are always present. Even if you don’t set them. Did I mention that (at least in proto3<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) all protobuffers can be zero-initialized with absolutely no data in them? Scalar fields get false-y values—<code>uint32</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> for example, and <code>string</code> is initialized as <code>""</code>.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to differentiate a field that was missing in a protobuffer from one that was assigned to the default value. Presumably this decision is in place in order to allow for an optimization of not needing to send default scalar values over the wire. Presumably, though the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding guide</a> makes no mention of this optimization being performed, so your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>As we’ll see when we discuss protobuffers’ claim to being god’s gift to backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs, this inability to distinguish between unset and default values is a nightmare. Especially if indeed it’s a design decision made in order to save one bit (set or not) per field.</p>
<p>Contrast this behavior against message types. While scalar fields are dumb, the behavior for message fields is outright <em>insane.</em> Internally, message fields are either there or they’re not—but their behavior is crazy. Some pseudocode for their accessor is worth a thousand words. Pretend this is Java or something similar:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>private</span> Foo m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-2"></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>public</span> Foo foo {</span>
<span id="cb3-4">  <span>// only if `foo` is used as an expression</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5">  get {</span>
<span id="cb3-6">    <span>if</span> (m_foo != <span>null</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-7">      <span>return</span> m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-8">    <span>else</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9">      <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span>();</span>
<span id="cb3-10">  }</span>
<span id="cb3-11"></span>
<span id="cb3-12">  <span>// instead if `foo` is used as an lvalue</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13">  mutable get {</span>
<span id="cb3-14">    <span>if</span> (m_foo = <span>null</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-15">      m_foo = <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span>();</span>
<span id="cb3-16">    <span>return</span> m_foo;</span>
<span id="cb3-17">  }</span>
<span id="cb3-18">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The idea is that if the <code>foo</code> field is unset, you’ll see a default-initialized copy whenever you ask for it, but won’t actually modify its container. But if you modify <code>foo</code>, it will modify its parent as well! All of this just to avoid using a <code>Maybe Foo</code> type and the associated “headaches” of the nuance behind needing to figure out what an unset value should mean.</p>
<p>This behavior is especially egregious, because it breaks a law! We’d expect the assignment <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code> to be a no-op. Instead the implementation will actually silently change <code>msg</code> to have a zero-initialized copy of <code>foo</code> if it previously didn’t have one.</p>
<p>Unlike scalar fields, at least it’s possible to detect if a message field is unset. Language bindings for protobuffers offer something along the lines of a generated <code>bool has_foo()</code> method. In the frequent case of copying a message field from one proto to another, iff it was present, you’ll need to write the following code:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>if</span> (src.has_foo(src)) {</span>
<span id="cb4-2">  dst.set_foo(src.foo());</span>
<span id="cb4-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that, at least in statically-typed languages, this pattern <em>cannot be abstracted</em> due to the nominal relationship between the methods <code>foo()</code>, <code>set_foo()</code> and <code>has_foo()</code>. Because all of these functions are their own <em>identifiers</em>, we have no means of programmatically generating them, save for a preprocessor macro:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>#define COPY_IFF_SET</span>(src,<span> </span>dst,<span> </span>field)<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>if</span><span> </span>(src.<span>has_</span><span>##</span>field(src))<span> </span>{<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>  </span>dst.<span>set_</span><span>##</span>field(src.field());<span> </span>\</span>
<span id="cb5-4">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>(but preprocessor macros are verboten by the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Preprocessor_Macros">Google style guide</a>.)</p>
<p>If instead all optional fields were implemented as <code>Maybe</code>s, you’d get abstract-able, referentially transparent call-sites for free.</p>
<p>To change tack, let’s talk about another questionable decision. While you can define <code>oneof</code> fields in protobuffers, their semantics are <em>not</em> of coproduct types! Rookie mistake my dudes! What you get instead is an optional field for each case of the <code>oneof</code>, and magic code in the setters that will just unset any other case if this one is set.</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems like it should be semantically equivalent to having a proper union type. But instead it is an accursed, unutterable source of bugs! When this behavior teams up with the law-breaking implementation of <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code>, it allows this benign-looking assignment to silently delete arbitrary amounts of data!</p>
<p>What this means at the end of the day is that <code>oneof</code> fields do not form law-abiding <code>Prism</code>s, nor do messages form law-abiding <code>Lens</code>es. Which is to say good luck trying to write bug-free, non-trivial manipulations of protobuffers. It is <em>literally impossible to write generic, bug-free, polymorphic code over protobuffers.</em></p>
<p>That’s not the sort of thing anybody likes to hear, let alone those of us who have grown to love parametric polymorphism—which gives us the <em>exact opposite promise.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-lie-of-backwards--and-forwards-compatibility">The Lie of Backwards- and Forwards-Compatibility</h2>
<p>One of the frequently cited killer features of protobuffers is their “hassle-free ability to write backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs.” This is the claim that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</p>
<p>What protobuffers are is <em>permissive.</em> They manage to not shit the bed when receiving messages from the past or from the future because they make absolutely no promises about what your data will look like. Everything is optional! But if you need it anyway, protobuffers will happily cook up …</p></div></div>

<p><em>BlackRock-managed funds and accounts lead investment in Astra to launch a new generation of space services to improve life on Earth</em></p>
<p>ALAMEDA, Calif., February 2, 2021 – Astra, the fastest privately-funded company in history to demonstrate orbital launch capability, and Holicity Inc. (NASDAQ: HOL) (“Holicity”), a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”), today announced a definitive business combination agreement that will result in Astra becoming a publicly traded company. The transaction reflects an implied pro-forma enterprise value for Astra of approximately $2.1 billion. Upon closing, the transaction is expected to provide up to $500 million in cash proceeds, including up to $300 million of cash held in the trust account of Holicity and an upsized $200 million PIPE led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock.</p>
<p>“This transaction takes us a step closer to our mission of improving life on Earth from space by fully funding our plan to provide daily access to low Earth orbit from anywhere on the planet,” said Chris Kemp, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Astra.</p>
<p>“I have long believed space provides an unmatched opportunity to benefit and enrich society,” said Craig McCaw, Chairman and CEO of Holicity. “Astra’s space platform will further improve our communications, help us protect our planet, and unleash entrepreneurs to launch a new generation of services to enhance our lives.”</p>
<p>In December 2020, Astra joined a small, elite group of companies that have made it to space. With over 50 launches in manifest across more than 10 private and public customers, including NASA and DOD, Astra has booked over $150 million of contracted launch revenue. Astra will begin delivering customer payloads this summer and begin monthly launches by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Following the closing of the transaction, the combined company will continue to be led by Founder and CEO Chris Kemp. It is expected that Craig McCaw will join Astra’s board of directors.</p>
<p>The proposed transaction, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021, has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Astra and Holicity and remains subject to approval by Holicity’s stockholders. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company will be named Astra and will be listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “ASTR.”</p>
<h3>Transaction Overview</h3>
<p>Holicity, which currently holds over $300 million of cash in trust, will combine with Astra in a</p>
<p>transaction that is estimated to result in a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion. Cash proceeds in connection with the transaction will be funded through a combination of Holicity’s $300 million cash in trust and a $200 million fully committed common stock PIPE at $10.00 per share, led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. Astra’s existing shareholders will hold approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company immediately following the consummation of the transaction, assuming no redemptions by Holicity’s existing public stockholders. Astra’s founders will hold their interest in the pro forma combined company through super-voting (10:1) common stock.</p>
<p>Completion of the proposed transaction is subject to approval of Holicity’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including a registration statement being declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021.</p>

                    <p>To properly test and track, you need software that makes the feedback process fast and easy. However, not all software applications live up to their advertised promises. If you want a fast, smooth, and accurate bug tracking and testing process, you need the following types of software applications.</p>

                    <h2>1. Task management software that supports task grouping</h2>
                    <p>You probably have task management software already. That’s great, but does your task management program support grouping your tasks or hiding tasks that aren’t pressing for the day? And how about setting reminders and flagging tasks as high priority to ensure they get done on time?</p>
                    <p>Technically, you should have separate bug tracking software, but you’ll need to break that process down into multiple tasks and maybe even sub-tasks. That’s where things can get messy in your task management application.</p>
                    <p>Tasks related to fixing bugs are more likely to be ongoing with a future due date that changes as you progress. This means you’ll always see those tasks in your daily to-do list and that can feel overwhelming.</p>
                    <p>Working on your daily tasks can be stressful when you can’t categorize or tag tasks in a meaningful way. You’ll see every task at once and that creates pressure.</p>
                    <p>If you’re going to manage your debugging tasks, your software needs several capabilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ability to hide tasks or at least separate them from your normal daily tasks.</li>
                        <li>The ability to group tasks together to organize your workspace.</li>
                        <li>The ability to track progress, set due dates and reminders.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Being able to see how a development project looks in different browsers is critical. Whether you’re launching a website or a software application, browsers will display your project differently. Slight differences may not be a problem, but when a user reports a major problem on a specific device, you’ll want to see exactly what they see.</p>

                    <h2>3. Userback for collecting specific feedback</h2>
                    <p>You need to generate specific, actionable feedback throughout the development process. It’s not enough to ask clients or end users to email you their thoughts if they run into problems. If you go that route, you’ll end up with an abundance of emails that might feel more like nit picking than usable feedback. </p>
                    <p>One of the biggest frustrations developers face is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-07-19-a-devs-eye-view-of-bugs">getting unspecific comments from users</a>. Expert game developers constantly lament over comments like, “your game is broken—please fix it.” Software developers experience the same frustration. However, when you don’t give people an opportunity to provide specific feedback, you can expect random emails with generalized demands to fix unspecified problems.</p>
                    <p>If you’re going to collect feedback productively, you need a way to provide immediate feedback as they experience the problem. Otherwise, random, unspecific feedback is all you’ll ever get.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://www.userback.io/use-cases/bug-tracking">Userback solves this problem</a> by making it effortless for clients and customers to send you detailed, specific feedback regarding bugs as they occur. All they have to do is click a button on the side of your page and give feedback by typing into a text box, recording a video of a bug, or taking a screenshot with annotations directly from the webpage.</p>

                    <h2>4. Userback for visual bug reporting software</h2>
                    <p>You’re probably already using bug tracking software to identify bugs and find repetitive issues. Hopefully, your bug tracking software prioritizes issues so you can focus on the high priority issues first. All this is absolutely necessary, but it’s not enough if your goal is to fix bugs fast.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://dzone.com/articles/why-is-bug-tracking-tool-so-important-for-the-test" target="_blank">Bug testing and reporting are critical</a>, but traditional bug reports are challenging and time-consuming to decipher. To fix a bug, you need to replicate that bug, and text summaries make that difficult. </p>
                    <p>Most people don’t have the patience or technical knowledge to describe a bug in full detail, which means you may not be able to easily replicate that bug when reported. You might need to do some guesswork, set up specific parameters, and run your program over a period of days or weeks in an attempt to replicate a bug.</p>
                    <p>When you can’t replicate a bug, you can’t solve the problem. When you can’t replicate a bug quickly, you’ll be slow to solve the problem, which will only upset your end users and your clients. Userback solves this major issue and makes bug reporting and resolution fast.</p>
                    <p>With a simple screen recording, <a href="https://www.userback.io/blog/visual-bug-tracking">Userback collects bug reports in a visual format</a>. For example, a client or customer can record a bug in action using the video screen capture feature. It’s hard to replicate a bug based on text-only summaries. When you can see a video of what the user did to initiate the bug, you’ll know exactly how to replicate it, and you’ll be one step closer to a solution.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Every few months I end up in the a shady corner of the internet, with twenty tabs open searching for variations on <em>‘why the $%^&amp;!@ does this not work’</em>. Hours later I end up re-discovering the truth: using binary libraries in <code>$CURRENT_YEAR</code> still pretty much sucks.</p><p>So let’s try and get something positive out of this, and at least write up the facts of the situation. Here’s to hoping someone comes along and shows me I missed that “one weird trick” that will make all of this make sense.</p><p>So here we are, in no particular order, a bunch of hard-learned facts about using libraries (on unix-flavored operating systems)</p><div>
<li>
<p><em>Dynamic</em> or <em>shared</em> libraries are loaded up by your program at runtime. They contain lookup tables that map symbols to shared executable code. If you give someone a binary that links a dynamic library that they don’t already have, the OS will complain about missing libraries when they try to run it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic or “shared” libraries have names that start with <code>lib</code> and finish with <code>.so</code>. Unless you’re on a Mac, where they end with <code>.dylib</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic libraries themselves can link other dynamic libraries. These are known as <em>transitive dependencies</em>. All dependencies will need to be found to successfully run your binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to move a binary from one machine (where it was compiled) to another, you’ll almost certainly find that at least some of the shared libraries needed by your binary are no longer found. This is usually the first sign of trouble…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linux knows how to find libraries because it has a list of known locations for shared libraries in <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>. Each time you run <code>ldconfig</code>, the OS updates its cache of known libraries by going through directories in this file and reading the libraries it finds. OS X works differently… see <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/dyld/">dyld</a> and friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>ldd</code> (linux) or <code>otool -L</code> (OS X) to query your binary for the missing libraries. Beware that it is <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html">not safe</a> to do this on a binary you suspect may be malicious 😞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can safely copy dynamic libraries from one machine to another. As long as the environments are similar enough…<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> . In a perfect world (on linux), you could just copy the library you want to use into <code>/usr/local/lib</code> (the recommended place for unstable libraries) and then run <code>ldconfig</code> to make your OS reload its library cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, on OS X things work totally differently. Dynamic libraries have an <em>install name</em> which contains the absolute path. This path is baked into your binary at compile time. You can use <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/install_name_tool/">install_name_tool</a> to change it. Good luck!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On linux, Adding libraries to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> makes them visible to everything, so you may want to copy your library somewhere else so that only <em>your</em> binary knows how to find it. One way to do this is using <em>rpath</em>…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can set the <em>rpath</em> attribute of your binary to contain a directory hint for your OS to look in for libraries. This hint can be <em>relative</em> to your binary. This is especially useful if you always ship libraries in a relative directory to your binary. You can use <code>@origin</code> as a placeholder for the path of the binary itself, so an rpath of <code>@origin/lib</code> causes the OS to always look in <code>&lt;path to your binary&gt;/lib</code> for shared libraries at runtime. This can be used on both OS X and linux, and is one of the most useful tools to actually getting things working in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your OS isn’t finding a dynamic library that you <em>know</em> exists, you can try helping your OS by setting the environment variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to the directory containing it - your OS will look there first before default system paths. Beware, this is considered <a href="http://xahlee.info/UnixResource_dir/_/ldpath.html">bad practice</a>, but it might unblock you at a pinch. OS X has <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, which is similar, and also <code>DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, which is similar, but different (sorry).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dynamic libraries also have a thing called a <em>soname</em>, which is the name of the library, plus version information. You have seen this if you’ve seen <code>libfoo.so.3.1</code> or similar. This allows us to use different versions of the same library on the same OS, and to make non backwards-compatible changes to libraries. The soname is also baked into the library itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often, your OS will have multiple symlinks to a single library in the same directory, just with different paths containing version information, e.g. <code>libfoo.so.3</code>, <code>libfoo.so.3.1</code>. This is to allow programs to find compatible libraries with slightly different versions. Everything starts to get rather messy here… if you really need to get into the weeds, <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html">this article</a> will help. You probably only need to understand this if you are distributing libraries to users and need to support compatibility across versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, even if your binary only depends on a single symbol in a dynamic library, it must still link that library. Now consider that the dependency itself may also link other unused transitive dependencies. Accidentally “catching a dependency” can cause your list of shared library dependencies to grow out of control, so that your simple <code>hello world</code> binary ends up depending on hundreds of megabytes of totally unused shared libraries 😞.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One solution to avoiding “dependency explosions” is to statically link symbols directly into your binary, so let’s start to look at <em>static linking</em>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Static</em> libraries (<code>.a</code> files) contain symbol lookup table, similarly to dynamic libraries.
However, they are much more dumb and also a total PITA to use correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you compile your binary and link in only static dependencies, you will end up with a <em>static binary</em>. This binary will not need to load any dependencies at runtime and thus much easier to share with others!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>People On The Internet</em> will recommend that you do not not distribute static binaries, because it makes it hard to patch security flaws. With dynamic libraries, you just have to patch a single library e.g. <code>libssl.so</code>, instead of re-compiling everything on your machine that may have linked the broken library without your knowledge (i.e. everything).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who build production systems at companies recommend static libraries because it’s wayyyy the hell easier to just deploy a single binary with zero dependencies that can basically run anywhere. No one cares about how big binaries are these days anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still more people on the internet remind you that only one copy of a dynamic library is loaded into memory by the OS even when it is used by multiple processes, saving on memory pressure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The static library people remind you that modern computers have plenty of memory and library size is hardly the thing killing us right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OS X people point out that OS X <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1118/_index.html">strongly discourages</a> the use of statically linked binaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static libraries can’t declare any kinds of library dependencies. This means it is <em>your</em> responsibility to ensure all symbols are all baked correctly into your binary at link time - otherwise your linker will fail. This can make linking static libraries painfully error-prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you get <em>symbol not found</em> errors but literally swear that you linked every damn thing, you probably linked a static library, and forgot a transitive dependency that is needed by it. This pretty much sucks as it’s basically impossible to figure out where that library comes from. Try having a guess by looking at the error messages. Or something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and you must ensure that you link your static libraries in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45135/why-does-the-order-in-which-libraries-are-linked-sometimes-cause-errors-in-gcc">correct order</a>, otherwise you can still get <code>symbol not found errors</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are starting to think it might be hard to keep track of static libraries, you are following along correctly. There are tools that can help you here, such as <code>pkgconfig</code>, <code>CMake</code>, <code>autotools</code>… or <code>bazel</code>. It’s quite easy to get going, and achieve deterministic platform-independent static builds with no dynamic dependencies… Said no one ever 😓.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One classic way to screw up, is to compile a static library without using the <code>-fPIC</code> flag (for “position independent code”). If you do not do this, you will be able to use the static library in a binary, but you will not be able to link it into a dynamic library. This is especially frustrating if you were provided with a static library that was compiled without this flag and you can’t easily recompile it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware that <code>-fpic</code> is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3544035/what-is-the-difference-between-fpic-and-fpic-gcc-parameters">not the same</a> as <code>-fPIC</code>. Apparently, <code>-fPIC</code> always works but may result in a few nanoseconds of slowdown, or something. Probably you should use <code>-fPIC</code> and try not to think about it too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your compiler toolchain (e.g. <code>CMake</code>) usually has a one-liner way to link a bunch of static libraries into a single dynamic library with no dependencies of its own. However, should you want to link a bunch of static libraries into another static library… well I’ve never successfully found a reliable way to do this 😞. Why do this you may ask? Mostly for cffi - when I want to build a single static library from C++ and then link it into e.g. a go binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware that your compiler/linker is not smart! Just because the header files declare a function and your linker manages to find symbols for it in your library, doesn’t mean that the function is remotely the same. <a href="https://github.com/libspatialindex/libspatialindex/issues/93">You will discover this when you get undefined behavior at runtime.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and if the library you are linking was compiled with a <code>#define</code> switch set, but when you include the library’s headers, you do not set the define to the same value, welcome again to runtime <a href="https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG/issues/1474">undefined behavior land</a>! This is the same problem as the one above, where the symbols end up being incompatible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are trying to ship C++, another thing that can bite you is that the C++ standard library uses dynamic linking. This means that even the most basic <code>hello world</code> program cannot be distributed to others unless they have a compatible version of <code>libstdc++</code>. Very often you’ll end up compiling with a shiny new version of this library, only to find that your target is using an older, incompatible version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way to get around <code>libstdc++</code> problems is to statically link it into your binary. However, if you create a static library that statically links <code>libstdc++</code>, and your library uses C++ …</p></li></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install atomicwrites <span>1.4</span>.0 successful

  ✔ Install pytest <span>4.6</span>.11 successful
  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>
<p>For more features and demos, please refer to the <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM's website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frostming/pdm">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="some-random-words"><a href="#some-random-words" aria-label="some random words permalink"></a>Some random words</h2>
<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kubernetes, also known as k8s, is an open-source system for managing containerized applications. Since its introduction in 2014, Kubernetes has revolutionized modern application building towards containers and microservices.</p><p>It has automated the previously manual task of deploying and managing containerized applications, allowing easier scalability and simplifying the manual management required of infra teams.</p><p>As a result, Kubernetes is the go-to platform for companies scaling their applications and engineering teams.</p><p>The increased engineering efficiency and stability provided by the extensive Kubernetes platform also comes with increased complexity.</p><p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/03/04/2019-cncf-survey-results-are-here-deployments-are-growing-in-size-and-speed-as-cloud-native-adoption-becomes-mainstream/" target="_blank">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, over half of companies deploying applications on the Kubernetes platform have over 250 deployed microservices. In addition, according to a <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/03/04/2019-cncf-survey-results-are-here-deployments-are-growing-in-size-and-speed-as-cloud-native-adoption-becomes-mainstream/" target="_blank">report</a> polling 950 IT leaders, over 56% of companies planned to expand their use of microservices and deployments on Kubernetes in the next 12 months.</p><p>From these numbers, it's clear that most companies using Kubernetes either already have a staggering amount of microservices or are quickly on their way there. As companies begin to scale with Kubernetes, new problems of service overload arise. With so many Kubernetes deployments, service visibility is naturally obscured and difficult to avoid.</p><p>When you're running 50 or 500 services, it's much harder to keep track of service owners, oncall information, and other important information for each service than when you're running 5 services.</p><p>That's where Cortex comes in. With the new Cortex Kubernetes integration, you can quickly and easily map and keep track of your services and their owners, so whether you're running 5 or 500 services, you know what's happening with each. You can augment each k8s service with critical pieces of context like ownership (linked to your identity provider), documentation, on-call info, latency graphs, and more.</p><figure id="w-node-462784fda960-f078b551"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b30f41fbfce2f0104b295_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_12.55.09_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>While this may seem like a problem only applicable to large companies with those 500 services, it's never too soon to start cataloging and organizing your services. If your company has recently adopted or is considering adopting Kubernetes, chances are you're either already experiencing rapid growth of services and engineering or you anticipate it coming soon.</p><p>With Cortex, you can easily start mapping your Kubernetes services. Cortex grows with you as your cluster grows, making sure new services play well with the old ones and old ones don't get lost along the way. Your existing services get automatically mapped to the Kubernetes deployments, so getting started is extremely simple!</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b311a63ba4e69a5b356bd_Screen_Shot_2020-12-14_at_4.04.14_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So what happens if all your services have already gotten lost along the way and you already have those 500 services? If you have an established cluster and many services, the new Cortex Kubernetes integration helps you un-clutter in the click of a button.</p><p>Cortex automatically detects all your Kubernetes deployments and allows you to easily import all of them in a single click. You can quickly see your services, map them to owners, and start making sense of the clutter. The best part is, as your cluster inevitably grows even more, Cortex will continue to detect all your new Kubernetes services and map them automatically.</p><p>In addition to easily importing all your Kubernetes services to Cortex, you'll also soon be able to see important Kubernetes information for each service such as replica count, restarts, status, etc. directly from your catalog. Want to also see which k8s services are not conforming to standards on your team? You can use scorecards to score and monitor each service in your cluster for deployment health and readiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/601b3138bb1299f5719162ee_Screen_Shot_2021-02-01_at_1.19.02_PM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Each k8s service can be graded on rules you define in a scorecard</figcaption></figure><p>Sign up for a demo <a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and we'll send you a helm chart to try it out in your own cluster!</p></div></div>]]>

February 3, 2021 | https://wilw.dev/blog/2021/02/03/rss-rise-fall-rise/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wilw.dev/blog/2021/02/03/rss-rise-fall-rise/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Many people would consider RSS - Really Simple Syndication - to be a relic of the past. However I think it has been making a comeback.</p>
<p>RSS is a mechanism by which people can automatically receive updates from individual websites, similar to how you might follow another user on a social networking service. Software known as RSS <em>readers</em> can be used to subscribe to RSS <em>feeds</em> in order to receive these updates. As new content (e.g. a blog post) is published to an RSS-enabled website, its feed is updated and your RSS reader will show the new post the next time it refreshes. Many RSS readers have an interface similar to an email client, with read/unread states, folders, favourites, and more.</p>
<h2>The rise</h2>
<p>RSS was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">first released</a> in early 1999, and it steadily gained popularity amongst content producers and consumers, with adopters from media outlets and software implementations making their way into early Internet Eplorer and Firefox versions, amongst others. These were the days before the "real" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> hit, and in which websites were very much more silos of information. Tools like RSS were powerful then because they enabled the easy <em>aggregation</em> of information from multiple sources.</p>
<p>Not too long after this (Web 2.0 'began' in the mid 2000's), and during the years ever since, mainstream social networks became ubiquitous. Many people flock(ed) to these as a way to share and subscribe (by following others) to receive updates in real time, several times a day and from lots of different people and organisations. These services enabled features far beyond aggregation by allowing easy sharing, rating (e.g. likes) and commentating such that today such services have become the primary means of information and news sharing and reception for many people.</p>
<h2>The fall(?)</h2>
<p>At that time RSS was still very much "a thing" for many people (though the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader#Discontinuation">discontinuation of the hugely popular Google Reader in 2013</a> was a bit of a bummer to these communities). However new people now joining the web scene would be far more likely to instead engage with these extremely well-funded, well-marketed, and <em>centralised</em> social platforms - <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">perfectly engeineered to be addictive</a>, entirely driven and propagated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out">FOMO</a>, and focused on content-sharing (even if the content is often <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/30/facebook-letting-fake-news-spreaders-profit-investigators-claim">misinformation</a>) - where <em>you</em> are the product, rather than spend the time researching and subscribing to individual RSS feeds.</p>
<p>To some commentators in this space the concept behind all of these social platforms is known as the <em><a href="https://jackcheng.com/essays/the-slow-web/#the-fast-web">fast web</a></em> - a web that tells you when and what information to consume rather than letting you make that decision for yourself. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and others all started as just a <em>chronological</em> timeline of interesting content from friends and family. On all of these services today the "algorithm" determines what (and who) goes in your timeline, and it constantly learns what to feed you - and when - in order to get those few extra minutes from you each day. This is literally its business model.</p>
<p>What used to be an innocent bookmarking tool, Twitter's "favouriting" mechanism is now essentially a game of <strong>retweet roulette</strong> in which the algorithm will every now and again choose to include your "bookmarks" (not just retweets) on the feeds of people who follow you. If that's not anxiety-inducing or user-hostile then I don't know what is!</p>
<p>Of course this is something Facebook has done for a while too, except perhaps in a more sinister way - such as implying <a href="https://www.baekdal.com/thoughts/facebook-graph-search-privacy-woes">a user has liked something when they haven't at all</a>.</p>
<p>Other social networking tools can be more user-friendly. For example, the open-source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">Mastodon</a> software powers distributed social networks that aren't fuelled by addiction and instead give you more control over what you receive and where your posts go. However these tools still have some way to go to becoming anywere near mainstream.</p>
<p>I want to caveat some of the above: I obviously don't think any of this is the fault of the individual. These social platforms are fantastically easy places to set-up a web presence. Creating an Instagram, Facebook, or Tik-Tok account for you (or your business) takes literal seconds. Within a minute you can have your profile setup and be following a dozen people, and already getting engagement and "reactions" from others (remember those "Your friend, X, is now on Instagram!" type notifications?).</p>
<p>With all of this power and efficiency at the fingertips it's no wonder that people don't create their own personal websites anymore, or feel the need to reach out to actively keep-up with other such sites. What's the point in re-inventing the wheel when I can easily create a Facebook page for myself that includes an inbuilt blog "feed", a space for links, photos, and more? And it's "free"! The barrier to creating a self-owned personal space on the internet for yourself is considered too high for most people, and is probably still seen as "geeky" even if it does come with all the benefits of privacy and control.</p>
<p>And I'm not saying that self-owned spaces, RSS, and that whole ecosystem are related, or the opposite to, mainstream social media; more that it is a useful way to compare and contrast different ways of accessing and disseminating information and the level of control one has over this.</p>
<p>This probably feels like I'm going way off-piste, and I sort of have, but my key meaning here is that for several years the concept of RSS has evaporated from popular knowledge because people haven't <em>needed</em> it - either as a tool for receiving <em>or</em> disseminating information. Ask your non-tech friends and family if they've heard of RSS (and know what it is for a bonus point) - I bet the positive response rate will be low in most cases, especially in younger respondents.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think this is solely the fault of the social giants. Online media outlets - which would have needed to rely on RSS for years before online social media became more mainstream - now often completely ignore it or treat it as a second-class citizen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news">BBC News website</a> happily displays large friendly icons for Facebook, Twitter, and the like, but no mention of RSS (try <code>ctrl-F</code>). In fact, you'll probably need to search the web for "bbc rss" in order to find the RSS feeds that are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628494">listed on a page that hasn't been updated for over a decade</a> and which still lists IE7 and the long-discontinued Google Reader as sensible options (though ironically I suppose this does indicate the stability and robustness of the RSS system).</p>
<h2>The rise again</h2>
<p>Anyway, all that sounds a bit doom and gloom but I definitely think we are starting to see a shift in people's attitude towards and - importantly, trust in - these big tech companies. Facebook's recent attitiude towards information collection (and subsequent sharing) has <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/facebook-update-apple-privacy-ads-b1795916.html">hit mainstream headlines</a> and everyone must have seen <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/whatsapps-new-privacy-policy-requires-you-to-share-data-with-facebook">Whatsapp's popup about data sharing</a>. Too much uncertainty undermines the trust in these platforms, and people have understandably sought out other options. A few weeks ago Telegram reported an addition of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/telegram-adds-25-million-new-users-in-just-72-hours-as-rival-apps-falter">25 million new users within 72 hours</a> as a result of these policy "changes".</p>
<p>My parents aren't really tech-aware at all but even they were telling me last week on a video call about this "new app Signal" they had downloaded and begun to use with their friends - without any of my input.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what it is, but people seem to <em>care</em> more about their data these days. Whether that's because of GDPR, the fact that coronavirus means people aren't endlessly scrolling through social feeds on their daily commutes anymore, or something else or a mixture of everything. And that extends to being more picky about the information they receive too.</p>
<p>Either way, I've noticed more and more <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2021/rss.html">posts like this</a> (and the subsequent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26014344">reactions and discussions</a>) recently, and the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a> movement has brought about a surge in people - myself included, really - creating their own longer-form content, for which RSS is a perfect distribution mechanism.</p>
<p>I think we're on a bit of a brink representing a general - but real - change in attitude from people towards data, and the time that they choose to give to now lesser-trusted platforms. It is our responsibility to help educate about the alternative options so that those around us can make their own decisions. Whilst I am relatively new to RSS in the grand scheme of things (having only really started properly engaging with it about a year ago), it already makes me feel more in control of what I view, and when.</p>
<p>Whilst this concept doesn't need to be limited to RSS, it's a great starting point as it's easy to understand. It "feels" friendly, it helps power connections to the decentralised and <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">small web</a>.</p>
<p>It, as a concept, has no business model. Though of course you can pay for the software you use, and websites can make money through ads, but at least you have a <em>choice</em> regarding who you subscribe to and the software you use to do it through (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">there are lots of choices</a>). You aren't tied into anything and it respects your privacy - you don't need to "sign-up", provide your details, and sites don't know that <em>you</em> personally have subscribed.</p>
<p>RSS may be age-old, but it is an excellent way to still get the information you need as you begin to use mainstream social media less, and - although it doesn't need to be slow in itself - it is a fantastic tool to combine with the growing and user-respecting world of the <a href="https://jackcheng.com/essays/the-slow-web#timely-vs-real-time">slow web</a>, in which timeliness (where you're in control) is far more important than "real-time".</p>

<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>I've received some replies to this post that talk about the lack of mentions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)">Atom standard</a> and podcasts. RSS certainly is (and has been) a fantastic way to subscribe to podcasts. Its flexibility and ease of use has been a great tool for both content creators and consumers, and has helped to build the ecosystem of podcast apps and services we see today. And of course, there are other very useful distribution mechanisms and standards available for distributing information, such as Atom. This post was …</p></div></article></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<div><p>Back in 2013 exactly 1 year after the first Raspberry Pi was sold RS components – One of two licenced Raspberry Pi Manufacturers at the time released a limited production run of 1000 blue Raspberry Pis. </p><p>They came with a Certificate of Authenticity signed by Eben Upton and a matching Blue case from One Nine Design in Wales.   </p></div>

<div><p>There was a pretty big catch though. They were never available to purchase. So how did you get one? </p><p>The majority of them were donated to charities involving kids educations and some were given away as competition prizes. Although it seems like a few slipped through the net!</p></div>



<div><p>I managed to get my hands on one and there are several available on eBay. I spoke to the eBay seller and he claims his Friend that used to work for RS Components gave him them. </p><p>Lets take a look at mine.</p></div>

<p>The first thing you come across as the box is opened – the Certificate of Authenticity. Each Blue Pi has a number, mine is #80. </p>

<p>Carefully opening the boxed Pi and managing to not destroy the holographic security seals I found the Blue Pi in all its glory. Also included is a quick start guide and the Regulatory information. <br></p>

<p>Other than the Colour the Blue Pi is identical to a Rev 2 Model B as can be seen above – The only other difference is that the Ethernet port is covered with a holographic RS Components logo. <br></p>

<p>It turns out the Rev 2 Model B doesn’t only come in Blue and Green. Egoman (A Chinese electronic device manufacturer) were licenced to produce a Model B for the Chinese Market with a Red PCB to make the device easy to distinguish. The reason for this was simple, the boards are missing the FCC/CE markings making it illegal to import them into the EU or USA. It seems that very few did make it into the UK although they are around, a popular Crypto mining ASIC used the Red Pi as a controller board. If anyone has one for sale I would be very interested in purchasing one to complete my collection! </p>



<h2>Conclusion </h2>



<p>The Blue Pi is a cool device however its nothing more than a collectors item at this point. I haven’t even attempted to power this one on although I fully expect it will work!</p>



<p>More information can be found in the original press release <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/blue-pi/">here</a>. </p>



<p>There are also a few for sale on eBay <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/early-raspberry-Pi-Blue-Case-Collectors-Rare-Limited-Edition/333871943231?hash=item4dbc518e3f:g:qAcAAOSwtD5gExmD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> but be quick! They end tomorrow.  </p>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I avoided touching SVGs when working with front-end code. Iâ€™d have no trouble with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but SVGs always intimidated me with their bizarre syntax and those weird, indecipherable strings of letters and numbers. You know the ones:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;path</span> <span>d=</span><span>"M 4 4 h 16 a 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 v 14"</span> <span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I needed icons for a project, Iâ€™d install one of the many icon libraries that are available, but that always left me unsatisfied. Sure, thereâ€™s nothing wrong with using libraries, but itâ€™s always a good idea to know how the tools you use really work under the hood. So why not also learn how to draw your own SVG icons by hand, even if you end up using a library in the end?</p>

<p>As youâ€™ll see in this tutorial, coding SVG icons by hand is actually fairly straightforward once you master the basic shapes and syntax. Weâ€™ll draw a bunch of icons to help you hone your SVG skills. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at all of the icons weâ€™ll create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="32" height="32">

      <polyline points="16 5.5, 20 5.5, 20 9.5"></polyline>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re curious, I took inspiration for these SVG icons from <a href="https://feathericons.com/">Feather Icons</a>, a fantastic library created by <a href="https://colebemis.com/">Cole Bemis</a>. These icons will help us learn how to draw the following shapes with SVG:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lines</li>
  <li>Polylines</li>
  <li>Circles</li>
  <li>Polygons</li>
  <li>Curved paths</li>
</ul>

<p>Once youâ€™ve learned the basics, you can draw almost anything with SVGs.</p>

<p>I hope youâ€™re excited to get started! Feel free to jump around if you want, but Iâ€™ve structured this tutorial intentionally so that each section builds on new knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-svg">What Is an SVG?</h2>

<p><strong>SVG</strong> stands for <strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong>; itâ€™s a vector image format that allows you to draw shapes using a standard markup (XML) syntax. The â€œscalableâ€� part of the name is a key characteristic of SVGsâ€”unlike other image formats, they donâ€™t lose quality when you scale them beyond their original size. Whereas images store their data using fixed-size pixels, SVGs store them as XML definitions for shapes, which can easily be scaled responsively to any size.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also worth noting that you can animate SVGs; <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/">Joshua Comeau</a> uses this to great effect on his site, creating a delightful and interactive user experience.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-svgs-drawn">How Are SVGs Drawn?</h3>

<p>There are two ways to draw SVGs: by hand, where you define the markup explicitly using HTML, or through a <strong>vector image program</strong> like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png" alt="Inkscape's user interface consists of drawing tools on the left-hand side, page alignment and setup options on the right, and a canvas in the center." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/inkscape.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>These programs come with basic shapes, color pickers, drawing tools, and path manipulation, allowing you to create complex drawings with greater ease than if you were to do them by hand. Youâ€™ll typically see designers and logo artists using GUIs like Inkscape rather than coding SVGs by hand. Still, understanding how SVG markup works is a valuable learning experience. At the end of the day, these programs output <code>.svg</code> files; if you inspect those files, youâ€™ll find that their markup is just XML, and you can make sense of it if you understand how SVGs work.</p>

<h2 id="svg-101-how-to-code-svgs-by-hand">SVG 101: How to Code SVGs by Hand</h2>

<p>I know youâ€™re itching to get to the examples, but first things first!</p>

<p>All SVG shapes are defined within the SVG element itself, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- stuff goes here --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, thereâ€™s more to it than just that. Letâ€™s explore the basic anatomy of an SVG.</p>

<h3 id="svg-namespace-declarations">SVG Namespace Declarations</h3>

<p>If youâ€™ve ever inspected the contents of an <code>.svg</code> file, like one created by Inkscape or some other vector image program, you may have seen this <code>xmlns</code> attribute on the <code>svg</code> element itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is known as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course#declaring_namespaces">namespace declaration</a>. In simple terms, a namespace declaration helps a user agent like your browser to understand and parse an elementâ€™s syntax. Here, weâ€™ve declared that our namespace is SVG. A namespace declaration is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18468348/5323344">not required if youâ€™re rendering inline SVG icons</a>, like in HTML. But if youâ€™re including SVG <em>files</em> (e.g., as an image), then the SVG does need to specify its namespace. Iâ€™ll omit the namespace in this tutorial since we donâ€™t need one.</p>

<h3 id="svg-viewbox-and-size">SVG <code>viewBox</code> and Size</h3>

<p>Youâ€™ve probably also seen these three attributes: <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>viewBox</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span>
  <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span>
  <span>width=</span><span>"24"</span>
  <span>height=</span><span>"24"</span>
<span>&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, the <code>viewBox</code> attribute defines <strong>the dimensions of the viewport (â€œcanvasâ€�) for our SVG</strong>. The first two numbers allow us to pan the SVG viewport horizontally or vertically, giving it an appearance of some sort of inner offset relative to the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. Here, we have an offset of <code>0 0</code>, meaning the top-left corner of the viewport <em>is</em> the origin, <code>(0, 0)</code>. The last two numbers control the base size of the viewport, before the SVG is scaled. Larger numbers lead to a larger viewport and more space to work with, while smaller numbers lead to a smaller viewport and less space to work with. Here, the viewport size is declared to be <code>24x24</code>, so our coordinates range from <code>(0, 0)</code> (top-left) to <code>(24, 24)</code> (bottom-right):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png"><picture>
    <source srcset="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates-placeholder.webp" type="image/webp" data-srcset="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.webp">
    <img src="https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png" alt="An SVG's coordinate system has an origin of (0, 0) at the top-left corner. For an SVG whose viewBox is 0 0 24 24, the bottom-right corner is at (24, 24)." data-src="/assets/images/posts/svg-tutorial-how-to-code-svg-icons-by-hand/coordinates.png">
  </picture></a></p>

<p>The other two attributes, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, work just as youâ€™d expect: They define the width and height of your SVG element, in pixels. You can also change an SVGâ€™s size with CSS using <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, so while the SVG above has a starting width and height of <code>24px</code>, it doesnâ€™t <em>always</em> have to be that size. Thatâ€™s the whole point of SVG, after allâ€”they can scale to <em>any</em> size!</p>

<p>Moreover, note that the the width and height of an SVG donâ€™t need to match the <code>viewBox</code>â€™s size. In fact, the coordinates of all SVG shapes that we draw are relative to the <code>viewBox</code>, not to the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the SVG.</p>

<p>For example, if our <code>viewBox</code> is <code>0 0 24 24</code> but weâ€™ve set the width and height to be <code>32</code>, or some other number, then weâ€™re still working within a base viewport size of <code>24x24</code>, so thereâ€™s no visible point like <code>(25, 25)</code>. Everything will just get scaled up by a factor of <code>1.3</code> to give us a bigger SVG drawing. This is really useful because it means we can draw all of our icons using a fixed viewport size, and if we later want to scale it up, we donâ€™t have to adjust the shapes and their coordinatesâ€”the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> will scale everything for us.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, Iâ€™ll use a <code>viewBox</code> of <code>0 0 24 24</code>, but dimensions of <code>64x64</code> so theyâ€™re easier to see. You can use any values that you want, though, so long as you adjust your markup accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="svgs-and-pixels">SVGs and â€œPixelsâ€�</h3>

<p>Before we move on, a clarifying note on pixels and SVGs: With the most basic SVG, one pixel unit maps to exactly one unit on your screen. But as noted on the MDN docs, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Positions#what_are_pixels">this isnâ€™t always the case</a>. SVGs are scalable, after all, so <code>1px</code> in the SVG definition may actually map to <code>4px</code> if the SVG has been scaled to a larger size with <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. This is unlike the behavior of images, where one â€œpixelâ€� is always a fixed-size unit of measurement. Key takeaway: Wherever I use <code>px</code> as a unit, donâ€™t take that to mean one literal output pixel on the userâ€™s screen.</p>

<h2 id="creating-basic-shapes-with-svg">Creating Basic Shapes with SVG</h2>

<p>The best way to learn how to draw SVG icons by hand is to work with basic shapes. To get started, weâ€™ll draw some icons using lines. This will get us familiar with some of the basics of SVG before we dive into more advanced shapes.</p>

<h3 id="1-lines">1. Lines</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ll practice our line-drawing skills by recreating the three icons below. Youâ€™ll find these in lots of text editors that offer text alignment options, so while this exercise may seem trivial, itâ€™s actually very practical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="9.4" x2="16" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="19.8" x2="16" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="9.4" x2="18" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="6" y1="19.8" x2="18" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
  <li>
    <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="64" height="64">
      <line x1="2" y1="4.2" x2="22" y2="4.2"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="9.4" x2="22" y2="9.4"></line>
      <line x1="2" y1="14.6" x2="22" y2="14.6"></line>
      <line x1="8" y1="19.8" x2="22" y2="19.8"></line>
    </svg>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, these all consist of just four horizontal lines.</p>

<p>To draw a line in SVG, we need two things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A starting point: <code>(x1, y1)</code>.</li>
  <li>An ending point: <code>(x2, y2)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a reminder, an SVGâ€™s coordinate system starts with <code>(0, 0)</code> at the top-left corner. The <code>x</code>-values increase as you move to the right, and the <code>y</code>-values increase as you move down.</p>

<p>SVGs allow us to specify the starting and ending points for lines using four attributes: <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>, and <code>y2</code>. So, to draw a simple horizontal line, we could do the following:</p>


<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;svg</span> <span>viewBox=</span><span>"0 0 24 24"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"64"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"64"</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;line</span> <span>x1=</span><span>"0"</span> <span>y1=</span><span>"4.2"</span> <span>x2=</span><span>"24"</span> <span>y2=</span><span>"4.2"</span><span>/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can think of this as telling the browser to put an imaginary pen down at <code>(0px, 4.2px)</code> and move it right until it reaches <code>(24px, 4.2px)</code>.</p>

<p>If you use this markup on your end, you wonâ€™t see anything just yet. Thatâ€™s because we havenâ€™t told the browser what color to use for the line! There are two ways we can do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> attribute on the SVG element or any of its individual shapes.</li>
  <li>Setting the <code>stroke</code> property via CSS, on the SVG element or any of its shapes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both will do the same thing, but I prefer the CSS approach since it means writing less code. You can either pass in a hard-coded color, like a hex value, or use the magic <code>currentColor</code> value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>svg</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>stroke</span><span>:</span> <span>currentColor</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In CSS, <code>currentColor</code> always references the current text <code>color</code>, which is either the color inherited from the parent or whatever color youâ€™ve explicitly defined for that element. I prefer <code>currentColor</code> for SVGs, as it makes it easy for me to insert my icons anywhere I want, and theyâ€™ll inherit the surrounding text color. Moreover, if that text color is set using CSS custom properties, <code>currentColor</code> will change whenever the custom property changes! This is useful for styling SVG icons in apps that have both a light and a dark mode (like this …</p></div></article></div></div>

The sensor is in the small window near the “SpotON” port.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=hs0FdiTHMbc">Video explanation</a> of the principal of operation.</p></div>
<p>About a year ago, my girlfriend says, “I think we can sequence DNA in our extra room.” She showed me the website of Oxford Nanopore, which makes a USB DNA sequencer. We joked about it for a bit and that was that.</p>
<p>Until October, when I decided to buy her one for Christmas. I punched my credit card into their nice online store and waited for my shipping confirmation, which never arrived. Finally, I emailed them and found out I needed to join their “community.” At this point, I should mention that I’m not a biologist and I’m certainly not qualified to join a community of researchers. And they wanted to have a phone call. And this thing had better arrive by Dec. 25.</p>
<p>So I fessed up to my girlfriend (who has a PhD in genetics) and she wrote me a notecard with exactly what to say. I studied up. The day comes and I’m all nervous. The rep, I’ll call her Alice, phones and I proudly explain all the things I’m going to do, straight off my notecard.</p>
<p>Then Alice starts asking questions. I was not prepared for questions. Do I have a temperature controlled fridge? Duh, of course (in the kitchen)<span id="easy-footnote-1-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-233" title="it wasn&amp;#8217;t and we soon acquired a new fridge"><sup>1</sup></a></span> A freezer? Yes obviously<span id="easy-footnote-2-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-233" title="yeah we bought a new one of those too"><sup>2</sup></a></span>. A centrifuge and thermocycler? “Uh sure yeah I have that<span id="easy-footnote-3-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-233" title="hope that thing I just claimed to own isn&amp;#8217;t too expensive"><sup>3</sup></a></span>.” Then Alice started asking questions about my research. Uh oh. I repeat something about bacterial colonies from my card but she isn’t buying it. I manage to get out that I understand this isn’t a spit-in-the-tube-and-done thing and that’s all I’ve got. She keeps pushing and I eventually admit that I’m really buying it for my girlfriend for Christmas. Apparently that’s okay, since once Alice finishes laughing she said that it will arrive by Dec. 25 but they don’t offer a gift-wrap service.</p>
<p>The box arrives, packed in some sweet dry ice stuff. Dec. 25 comes and I get a set of pipettes and a PCR machine.</p>
<p>The obvious thing to sequence is one of us but the MinION can only do 1-2 billion bases per run<span id="easy-footnote-4-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-233" title="in our hands; Oxford Nanopore <a href=&quot;https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion&quot;>claims 10-20 Gb now</a>"><sup>4</sup></a></span>; to have decent quality for a human you need more like 90 billion <span id="easy-footnote-5-233"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-233" title="there&amp;#8217;s a lot of variables here, go read this: <a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4060&quot;>Nanopore sequencing and assembly of a human genome with ultra-long reads</a>"><sup>5</sup></a></span>. We decide to swab our mouths before brushing our teeth and find out what’s in there. My girlfriend whips up some media, we plop our swabs in, and put the tubes in the $30 chicken egg incubator she found on Amazon. Two days later I’m informed that the cultures smell like “really really bad breath,” and that I “really ought to smell them for myself,” which I studiously avoid for the next two months.</p>
<p>With the help of a <a href="https://greenbioresearch.com/product/genomic-dna-isolation-extraction-purification-kit-for-blood-bacteria-cell-tissue-samples/">$80 genomic DNA extraction kit</a>, we cut up the cells, filter all their bits out, and have genomic DNA ready to go. First we run a gel electrophoresis to prove to ourselves that we didn’t mess up the extraction too much.</p>
<p>At this step, all the real biologists out there are assuming I’m going to talk about quantifying the DNA to make sure we had the right concentration before blowing a $500 flow-cell (the consumable part of the MinION) on this. Yeah, that would be a lot of work and the line is pretty bright in the gel…</p>
<p>We open the fridge to get out the sequencer’s flow-cell and notice that everything is frozen. Oh %$@*#@#*. I set the fridge to “10” because that seemed like a good idea. Alice definitely isn’t going to buy my warranty-return story. Two days later we’ve got a new thermometer and are praying that 100 freeze-thaw cycles are, uh, totally fine.</p>
<p>Happily the MinION comes with a calibration program that doesn’t seem to notice our substandard storage: all green. At this point we discover that Oxford Nanopore helpfully sends everyone a set of sample DNA to run first. We decide that sounds like a really good idea.</p>
<p>The promotional videos for the MinION claim, “simple 10 minute setup.” About two hours later, we’ve done the library prep, and we’re pipetting into the device. There are lots of warnings on their webpage about how you really can’t let air into the thing (permanent destruction of the flow-cell, blah blah). So of course the first thing we do is introduce an air bubble. But it only covers half the sensor. I think it’s the most expensive 5µL of air I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>It turns out the sequencer produces so much data the minimum requirements are a 1TB SSD and a quad-core CPU. My girlfriend’s laptop has 200 GB and a dual core, so that will have to suffice. We fire it up and it starts producing reads. We’re over the moon. 6-hours later the run finishes, but only 10% of the bases have been “called.” The way the system works is by reading tiny changes in electric current as the molecules pass through the nanopore. Apparently the signal processing is kind of hard because 2 days later it’s still going. I play Overwatch by myself.</p>
<p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" width="99%" height="150"><source src="https://i.imgur.com/Mlg4V3f.mp4"></video><br>
<em>Sequencing. You can see the 512 ports on the laptop screen. Approximately half are green (sequencing or waiting for DNA) and the other half are blue (air-bubbled).</em></p>
<p>The Oxford Nanopore website supports automated uploading and analysis of some datasets, including the calibration run. <a href="http://www.abarry.org/likelytobeforgotten/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Selection_120.png">Our run</a> produced 983 million (aligned) base pairs, which any professionals reading this are scoffing at, but I’m pretty sure Celera circa 2000 would have been impressed. I certainly am. The last time I did anything close to this, we tested PTC tasting with a gel electrophoresis that took all day and effectively sequenced 1 base. We prep and load our mouth-bacteria genomic DNA into the sequencer. We’re reusing the flow-cell to save money and it’s hard to load correctly. We’re all paranoid about air bubbles now, but there’s a ton of them in the little fluid pipes. Eventually we look at each other, shrug, and put the sample in. It goes nowhere.</p>
<p>The library prep includes adding “loading beads” to the sample which give the liquid a ghostly white color. You can see if your sample is on the sensor by tracking the movement of that color, and ours clearly was stuck on the top of the port. Eventually we searched the forums and found someone else incompetent enough to have the same problem, with a solution that can be summarized as, “pull some liquid out of a different port and hope.” It worked great.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a few last years I’ve been learning programming in various languages, on and off, with more or less success. Some languages that I’ve tried include Python, Java, Haskell and even JavaScript. And of course Clojure. But it has been going slowly, not because those languages (or programming in general) are hard. It’s because I lacked consistency in doing things on regular basis due to lack of time and energy; I’ve often been mentally exhausted at my regular IT work. Here’s how I finally managed to organize myself and actually started getting it!</p><h3 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h3><p>I’ve been interested in computers for most of my life. It can be shortly described as ‘power user’ e.g. <em>system configuration, setup, various audio/video editing tools…</em>, but I’ve never really took up programming until 2017. (You can read about my contemporary views <a href="https://savo.rocks/posts/an-unexpected-toolbox-for-a-beginner-programmer/" target="_blank">here</a>). Back then I managed to learn some Python syntax, but it all came down to following the materials I have been learning from, and I gave up after some time. In the meantime I have been dabbling with various languages and technologies, but never crossed the chasm to serious work beyond tutorials and books.</p><h3 id="recent-development">Recent development</h3><p>When I wasn’t trying to learn programming I was playing guitar with various bands I had and worked in several companies on various positions in IT departments. Those positions included various tasks such as system administration &amp; maintenance, vendor coordination and even IT support call-center coordination. During that time I still managed to dabble with programming irregularly, mostly with Clojure because I liked how it doesn’t get in my way. It can be set up almost instantly and the syntax is very minimal, which lets me concentrate on shaping my ideas into code. But very often the workload was big enough to keep me from programming constantly, so I didn’t get very far. However, recently I decided to concentrate on programming, as I realized that it brings me much joy, even when I am completely lost in the process, because when I overcome obstacles it feels phenomenal.</p><h3 id="current-situation">Current situation</h3><p>I discovered a one-step-beyond-basics book that suits my needs perfectly: <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dswdcloj3" target="_blank">Web Development with Clojure</a> and bought a copy. I’m getting serious now :) Currently, the book is in beta, but it is expected to be finished very soon. This book shows in detail how to build modern web applications using various Clojure libraries. Clojure is different from other languages in that matter: it doesn’t have a <em>web-app framework</em>. Instead, the programmers combines various libraries which suit their particular needs.</p><h3 id="the-approach">The approach</h3><p>So, how is this time different than any other when I tried to learn programming? Read on.<br></p><ul><li>Walk the unwalked path: This time, instead of just following the book, I decided to explore the documentation of libraries that were introduced, and to try to experiment with them myself. There are often multiple libraries that serve the same purpose, and the author is kind enough to mention them in his book. One such example is two libraries for HTML templating: <a href="https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer" target="_blank">Selmer</a> which uses Django-like syntax, and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup" target="_blank">Hiccup</a> which converts Clojure vectors to html, so <code>[:h1 "Hello There"]</code> becomes <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello There&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. Hiccup-way seemed more attractive to me, so I decided to write the whole template in in, and I have learned more doing that, than I have ever learned following book-code. I was forced to try various approaches out, read the documentation, ask around online for solutions and in the end I felt I understand what I wrote much better.</li><li>Do things regularly: There is a wise saying which goes something like: <em>it is better to perform average every day, than to be excellent once in a while</em>. OK, it probably sounds better than I wrote it, but the point is there. I try to follow it, and to program every day for 6-8 hours. I realized that sometimes can be difficult to even start, so I start my programming day by doing <u>one</u> <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/" target="_blank">4clojure</a> exercise per day. This helps me to get <em>warmed-up</em> as I can start solving the problem immediately, because the tasks usually require just using the right Clojure function (or combination of functions), so I make sure to search this awesome <a href="https://jafingerhut.github.io/cheatsheet/clojuredocs/cheatsheet-tiptip-cdocs-summary.html" target="_blank">Clojure Cheatsheet</a> for the functions that I’ll use, and usually manage to find them. After that I just open my project, the book and code away!</li><li>Revisit previous chapters: I like to come back a little after some time to re-read previous materials to see if I’ll have new insight and maybe notice something that I missed the first time when I read the chapter. Usually there are <em>a-ha</em> moments, and makes this part very valuable in the process.</li></ul><p>The book guides reader through building a microblogging platform, kind of like a social network, where multiple users can have their message boards and interact with each other, have their feeds, etc. The first few chapters deal with crash-course setting up a page where all the messages are displayed (no multiple users), and the form for entering a message is present, then it moves on to teach about core components of a web app (creating web server, request routing, handling, middleware…), another chapter deals with what <a href="https://luminusweb.com/" target="_blank">Luminus</a> templating library provides, then it moves on to using ClojureScript for SPA approach, which teaches very powerful and modern concepts. I decided to build something like a <em>beer-log</em> application, where I will keep track of craft beers that I’ve tried. I wanted to do something different, rather than following book paren-for-paren. Who knows, maybe my beer app will someday be good as, I don’t know, <a href="https://untappd.com/" target="_blank">Untappd</a> maybe?</p></div></div>]]>

<h3><strong>How our for-profit company became a nonprofit, to better tackle the digital divide.</strong></h3>



<p><em>Originally posted on the <a href="https://www.endlessos.org/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endless OS Foundation blog</a>.</em></p>



<h4><strong>An 8-year journey to a nonprofit</strong></h4>



<p>On the 1st of April 2020, our for-profit Endless Mobile officially became a nonprofit as the Endless OS Foundation. Our launch as a nonprofit just as the global pandemic took hold was, predictably, hardly noticed, but for us the timing was incredible: as the world collectively asked â€œWhat can we do to help others in need?â€�, we framed our mission statement and launched our .org with the same very important question in mind. Endless always had a social impact mission at its heart, and the challenges related to students, families, and communities falling further into the digital divide during COVID-19 brought new urgency and purpose to our teamâ€™s decision to officially step in the social welfare space.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>On April 1st 2020, our for-profit Endless Mobile officially became a nonprofit as the Endless OS Foundation, focused on the #DigitalDivide.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Our updated status was a long time coming: we began our transformation to a nonprofit organization in late 2019 with the realization that the true charter and passions of our team would be greatly accelerated without the constraints of for-profit goals, investors and sales strategies standing in the way of our mission of digital access and equity for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for 8 years we made a go of it commercially, headquartered in Silicon Valley and framing ourselves as a tech startup with access to the venture capital and partnerships on our doorstep. We believed that a successful commercial channel would be the most efficient way to scale the impact of bringing computer devices and access to communities in need. We still believe this – weâ€™ve just learned through our experience that we donâ€™t have the funding to enter the computer and OS marketplace head-on. With the social impact goal first, and the hope of any revenue a secondary goal, we have had many successes in those 8 years bridging the digital divide throughout the world, from Brazil, to Kenya, and the USA. Weâ€™ve learned a huge amount which will go on to inform our strategy as a nonprofit.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-9s0us"><p><strong>Endless always had a social impact mission at its heart. COVID-19 brought new urgency and purpose to our teamâ€™s decision to officially step in the social welfare space</strong>.</p></blockquote>



<h4><strong>Our unique perspective</strong></h4>



<p>One thing we learned as a for-profit is that the OS and technology weâ€™ve built has some unique properties which are hugely impactful as a working solution to digital equity barriers. And our experience deploying in the field around the world for 8 years has left us uniquely informed via many iterations and incremental improvements.<br></p>

<p>With this knowledge in-hand, weâ€™ve been refining our strategy throughout 2020 and now starting to focus on what it really means to become an effective nonprofit and make that impact. In many ways it is liberating to abandon the goals and constraints of being a for-profit entity, and in other ways itâ€™s been a challenging journey for me and the team to adjust our way of thinking and let these for-profit notions and models go. Previously we exclusively built and sold a product that defined our success; and any impact we achieved was a secondary consequence of that success and seen through that lens. Now our success is defined purely in terms of social impact, and through our actions, those positive impacts can be made with <em>or without</em> our â€œproductâ€�. That means that we may develop and introduce technology to solve a problem, but it is equally as valid to find another organization’s existing offering and design a way to increase that positive impact and scale.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>We develop technology to solve access equity issues, but it’s equally as valid to find another organization’s offering and partner in a way that increases their positive impact.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The analogy to Free and Open Source Software is very strong – while Endless has always used and contributed to a wide variety of FOSS projects, weâ€™ve also had a tension where weâ€™ve been trying to hold some pieces back and capture value – such as our own application or content ecosystem, our own hardware platform – necessarily making us competitors to other organisations even though they were hoping to achieve the same things as us. As a nonprofit we can let these ideas go and just pick the best partners and technologies to help the people weâ€™re trying to reach.</p>



<figure><a href="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="347" height="231" src="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg" alt="School kids writing on paper" srcset="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg 347w, https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Students_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px"></a></figure>



<h4>Digital equity â€¦ 4 barriers we need to overcome</h4>



<p>In future, our decisions around which projects to build or engage with will revolve around 4 barriers to digital equity, and how our Endless OS, Endless projects, or our partnersâ€™ offerings can help to solve them. We define these 4 equity barriers as: barriers to <strong>devices</strong>, barriers to <strong>connectivity</strong>, barriers to <strong>literacy</strong> in terms of your ability to use the technology, and barriers to <strong>engagement</strong> in terms of whether using the system is rewarding and worthwhile.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-5r9ec"><p><strong>We define the 4 digital equity barriers we exist to impact as:</strong><br>1. barriers to <strong>devices</strong><br>2. barriers to <strong>connectivity</strong><br>3. barriers to <strong>literacy</strong><br>4. barriers to <strong>engagement</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>It doesnâ€™t matter who makes the solutions that break these barriers; what matters is how we assist in enabling people to use technology to gain access to the education and opportunities these barriers block. Our goal therefore is to simply ensure that solutions exist â€“ building them ourselves and with partners such as the FOSS community and other nonprofits â€“ proving them with real-world deployments, and sharing our results as widely as possible to allow for better adoption globally.</p>



<p>If we define our goal purely in terms of whether people are using Endless OS, we are effectively restricting the reach and scale of our solutions to the audience we can reach directly with Endless OS downloads, installs and propagation. Conversely, partnerships that scale impact are a win-win-win for us, our partners, and the communities we all serve.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Engineering impact</strong></h4>



<p>Our Endless engineering roots and capabilities feed our unique ability to build and deploy all of our solutions, and the practical experience of deploying them gives us evidence and credibility as we advocate for their use. Either activity would be weaker without the other.</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-1i0jh"><p><strong>Our engineering roots and capabilities feed our unique ability to build and deploy digital divide solutions.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Our partners in various engineering communities will have already seen our change in approach. Particularly, with GNOME we are working hard to invest in upstream and reconcile the long-standing differences between our experience and GNOME. If successful, many more people can benefit from our work than just users of Endless OS. Weâ€™re working with Learning Equality on Kolibri to build a better app experience for Linux desktop users and bring content publishers into our ecosystem for the first time, and weâ€™ve also taken our very own Hack, the immersive and fun destination for kids learning to code, released it for non-Endless systems <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.hack_computer.Clubhouse">on Flathub</a>, and made it fully open-source.</p>



<figure><a href="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="347" height="231" src="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg" alt="Planning tasks with sticky notes on a whiteboard" srcset="https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash.jpg 347w, https://ramcq.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/231_Planning_Endless-OS-Foundation_unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px"></a></figure>



<h4><strong>Whatâ€™s next for our OS?</strong></h4>



<p>What then is in store for the future of Endless OS, the place where we have invested so much time and planning through years of iterations? For the immediate future, we need the capacity to deploy everything weâ€™ve built â€“ all at once, to our partners. We built an OS that we feel is very unique and valuable, containing a number of world-firsts: first production OS shipped with OSTree, first Flatpak-only desktop, built-in support for updating OS and apps from USBs, while still providing a great deal of reliability and convenience for deployments in offline and educational-safe environments with great apps and content loaded on every system.</p>



<p>However, we need to find a way to deliver this Linux-based experience in a more efficient way, and weâ€™d love to talk if you have ideas about how we can do this, perhaps as partners. Can the idea of â€œEndless OSâ€� evolve to become a spec that is provided by different platforms in the future, maybe remixes of Debian, Fedora, openSUSE or Ubuntu?&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Build, Validate, Advocate</strong></h4>



<p>Beyond the OS, the Endless OS Foundation has identified multiple programs to help underserved communities, and in each case we are adopting our â€œbuild, validate, advocateâ€� strategy. This approach underpins all of our projects: can we <strong>build</strong> the technology (or assist in the making), will a community in-need <strong>validate</strong> it by adoption, and can we inspire others by telling the story and <strong>advocating</strong> for its wider use?</p>



<blockquote id="viewer-3t3do"><p><strong>We are adopting a â€œbuild, validate, advocateâ€� strategy.</strong><br>1. <strong>build</strong> the technology (or assist in the making)<br>2. <strong>validate</strong> by community adoption<br>3. <strong>advocate</strong> for its wider use</p></blockquote>



<p>As examples, we have just launched the Endless Key (link) as an offline solution for students during the COVID-19 at-home distance learning challenges. This project is also establishing a first-ever partnership of well-known online educational brands to reach an underserved offline audience with valuable learning resources. We are developing a pay-as-you-go platform and new partnerships that will allow families to own laptops via micro-payments that are built directly into the operating system, even if they cannot qualify for standard retail financing. And during the pandemic, weâ€™ve partnered with Teach For America to focus on very practical digital equity needs in the USAâ€™s urban and rural communities.</p>



<h4><strong>One part of the world-wide digital divide solution</strong></h4>



<p>We are one solution provider for the complex matrix of issues known collectively as the #DigitalDivide, and these issues will not disappear after the pandemic. Digital equity was an issue long before COVID-19, and we are not so naive to think it can be solved by any single institution, or by the time the pandemic recedes. It will take time and a coalition of partnerships to win. We are in for …</p></div></div>

              </p> <p>o what is a species? In the seventeenth century, European thinkers proposed that a group of organisms that could breed with each other could be called a species. A century on, Carl Linnaeus, the pioneering Swedish naturalist, popularised the use of combining two Latin terms: first the name of the genus,
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="u7ivdfqvucs5">[8]</sup>
            </a>
           then that of the species. The yellow-eyed bush frog has the name <em>Raorchestes </em>because it signifies the genus <em>Raorchestes</em>, which encompasses almost 65 species of bush frogs mostly from South Asia; <em>flaviocularis</em>&nbsp;is its species.</p></div><p>For all this time, scientists have been having furious arguments about the best way to classify species. There are presently more than 30 approaches to define a species, variously based in ancestry, ecology, appearances, even sound. The general consensus these days is to take an “integrative” approach. So Vijay started off with <em>flaviocularis</em>’s distinct looks––its morphology––and then worked on tracing its family tree in the DNA lab. The distinctiveness of its metallic calls, as well as its geographical distribution, helped along the hypothesis that <em>flaviocularis</em> was a species that hadn’t been described previously.</p><p>“Documenting the existence of a species is the first step to understanding our biodiversity,” Shanker said. It’s an exciting field because there is so much we don’t know. Ecologists have terms of art associated with these knowledge gaps. The Linnean Shortfall refers to the problem of undescribed lineages. A Wallacean Shortfall
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="wszrks8kngx3">[9]</sup>
            </a>
           refers to the lack of information about a species’ geographical distribution. “These shortfalls are the starting point for our exploration of ecology and evolution. There are lots of questions that can be answered once both these knowledge gaps are addressed,” said Shanker.</p><p>One set of questions is evolutionary in nature: Where did a species originate? If it started from Africa, how did it find its way into Asia and diversify? That’s how we got Asian elephants for instance: fossil remains indicate that the first elephant ancestors originated in Africa during the geological epoch known as the Early Pliocene.
            <a href="" onclick="return!1">
              <sup id="hfc0ff8tqwol">[10]</sup>
            </a>
           Recent genetic and fossil studies now confirm that their descendants moved into Asia 2-4 million years ago, and gave rise to the modern Asian elephant just 2.5 lakh years ago.</p><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>Geographic barriers such as deep gorges and wide rivers also affect dispersal, and can isolate populations. The gaps and valleys of the Western Ghats explain why there are so many different kinds of bush frogs. A species’ own ability to move around determines the kind of places it eventually gets to: birds are likelier than frogs to move from one mountain to another, for example.</p><p>Then they could ask after ecological factors such as rainfall, temperature and altitude, gradients along which species can adapt and evolve into different groups. </p></div><p>Finally, there are questions related to conservation. Research may focus on the availability of a type of plant if it appears that a species relies on it for survival. This data is analysed to help us approach answers to speculative questions like: what could happen to the species a hundred years from now; how would they adapt to climate change? </p><p>One of the things that is clear after a couple of centuries of study is that the species richness of a region increases as you move from the poles to the tropics. Within the tropics, you get “biodiversity hotspots.”

           These are sites that represent only 2.4% of the earth’s land surface, support more than 40% of endemic fauna, and are threatened by human habitation.</p><p>The Himalayas, with an estimated 10,000 species of plants including more than 3,100 endemics, is one of them. The states of north-eastern India that form part of the larger Indo-Burma hotspot are another. But easily the most well-studied hotspot in India is the Western Ghats.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Two</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>he Western Ghats stretch almost parallel to India’s west coast. They variously constitute about 1600kms of sparse and dense forests, blue mountains, steep cliffs, thorny bushes, flat plateaus, leech-ridden swamps and windy grasslands. At one end, they start as shrub-bearing hillocks about 10km north of India’s southernmost tip. Then, they become the Ashambu Hills, mighty granite mountains forming a natural border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and in the shadow of which lie spice gardens and homesteads.</p></div><p>Then comes the Shencottah Gap. After those 7km, the Ghats rise again to form the Meghamalai Hills, home of <em>flaviocularis</em>, the yellow-eyed bush frog. These are followed by a small plateau which leads to the hills of Palani and Anamalai. Cardamom, coffee and tea plantations blanket the slopes here. Look up, and mist permitting, you can see some of the tallest peaks in the south—“sky islands,” hosting ecosystems wildly different from those of the surrounding lowlands. In the shallow valleys of these highlands, naturally stunted forests known as the “sholas” occur alongside open grassland patches. </p><p>North of the Anamalais come the Nilgiris. But first, there’s a deep valley. At 32km wide, 100m above sea level, the Palghat Gap is the widest and lowest pass in the Ghats. A dusty national highway cuts right through it, connecting Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu and Palakkad in Kerala.</p><p>Beyond, the Ghats stretch into north Kerala and Karnataka, its high peaks separated occasionally by shallow valleys. They almost kiss the Arabian Sea before swerving east into Goa. By the time they taper off amidst the sugarcane fields of Maharashtra, they are less imposing and more climbable, now ambling along until they reach their other end in the deciduous forest tracts of south Gujarat.&nbsp; </p><p>The remarkable contiguity broken by wide gaps and valleys, the sheer range of landscapes, the distance covered: all this should indicate why the Ghats are a species discovery hotspot. They comprise less than 6% of India’s land area but are home to more than 30% of all plant, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird and mammal species found in the country. Of the 406 known frog and toad species in India, more than 200 are endemic to the Ghats. Over a hundred of these endemics have been discovered only in the last 20 years. </p></div></div></div></div></section></div><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><section data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p data-v-2fd21b62=""><h3>Three</h3></p> <div data-v-2fd21b62=""><div data-v-2fd21b62=""><p>

              </p> <p>NA-based techniques have transformed new species research across the world. Uma Ramakrishnan, a conservation geneticist and professor at Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences who led the genetic component of the research on sholakilis and chilappans, told me that India was still heavily reliant on morphological methods and distribution information till about a decade ago. Now there’s a whole suite of new technologies, including better computational and simulation programmes, that have popularised the use of genetic techniques to answer ecological questions. These technologies both advance and confirm the educated hunches researchers develop as they work.</p></div><p>There’s a flip side to this, too: taxonomic inflation, the over-categorisation of newly sighted animals. Some experts feel that researchers have begun claiming the tag of “new species” in cases where it is clearly unwarranted. Robin Kurian Abraham, a researcher at the University of Kansas, told me that the “overinflation” problem afflicts some Indian frog lineages too. Often, “new species” might just be sub-species, or different populations of the same species. “Why is it that we rarely hear of sub-species in frogs? There are even five extant sub-species of tigers across the world,” Abraham asked me.</p><p>The ‘species versus sub-species’ debate has been raging for years. Take the world of wolf taxonomy as an example. The grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus)</em> is found in most parts of the world. In 2018, a paper published in <em>Global Ecology and Conservation</em> by a team of researchers led by Geraldine Werhahn created a splash. DNA analysis using scat and hair samples of the Himalayan wolf had revealed a genetic adaptation to cope with the lower oxygen levels of high altitudes.</p><p>It provided a massive shot in the arm to the theory that the Himalayan wolf is evolutionarily distinct: its lineage diverged before the radiation of the modern grey wolf. But the journey to species-hood is long and arduous. In February last year, Werhahn told <em>The Guardian</em> that researchers needed to obtain one final piece of higher-quality genomic data for the separate species case to succeed with the International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN, the global organisation which evaluates and assesses conservation status. That quest is still on.</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

But, when compared to optical approaches, radar resolution is challenging, especially at orbital altitude due to the large physical antenna sizes necessary for handling electromagnetic waves 4,000x longer than visible light. To improve resolution, <a href="https://medium.com/the-downlinq/sar-101-an-introduction-to-synthetic-aperture-radar-2f0b6246c4a0" target="_blank">Synthetic Aperture Radar</a> (SAR) combines data from multiple radar pulses as a platform moves past a target, creating images with resolutions comparable to an infeasibly large <a href="http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/radariii.html" target="_blank">real aperture radar</a>. (Another way to visualize SAR is that it works similarly to <a href="https://www.radartutorial.eu/06.antennas/Phased%20Array%20Antenna.en.html" target="_blank">phased-array antennas,</a> but multiplexes a single antenna in time relative to a stationary target vs multiple antennas in space relative to a moving target.) SAR, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic-aperture_radar#History" target="_blank">first developed in the ‘50s</a> for military applications, has led to important scientific findings, such as the <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html" target="_blank">terrain imaging of Venus</a> and the detection of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan (<a href="http://lunar.earth.northwestern.edu/courses/450/titanlakes.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>). Today’s SAR systems have increased resolution and decreased cost, leading to a boom in smallsat SAR data from multiple new providers, including <a href="https://www.ursaspace.com/" target="_blank">Ursa</a>, <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/" target="_blank">Capella</a>, <a href="https://www.iceye.com/" target="_blank">ICEYE</a>, <a href="https://i-qps.net/" target="_blank">iQPS</a>, <a href="https://www.predasar.com/" target="_blank">PredaSAR</a>, <a href="https://synspective.com/" target="_blank">Synspective</a>, and <a href="https://umbra.space/" target="_blank">Umbra</a> (who <a href="https://spacenews.com/umbra-raises-32-million/" target="_blank">just raised $32 million in additional funding</a>). Capella Space is one of the industry leaders with resolutions of 50cm x 50cm from a 10-meter antenna deployed from a ~40kg smallsat (two of these were on Transporter-1, see below). According to Capella's lead SAR scientist, this resolution would require a real aperture radar of 49 km (yes, <em>kilo</em>meters). SAR resolution along the orbital ground track (aka “azimuth” or “cross-range” resolution) is determined by radar pulse processing frequency—and therefore doesn't degrade with altitude, unlike optical and real aperture radar—, while the side looking "range" resolution is primarily determined by the radar's wavelength (many high-res SAR platforms use the ~3 cm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_band" target="_blank">8–12 GHz X-band</a>, including Capella). SAR's drawbacks include vertical height distortion (called layover and foreshortening) and shadowing due to its side-looking orientation in relation to the craft's ground track (SAR cannot look straight down). SAR is also unable to accurately observe moving targets and can produce significant amounts of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_(interference)" target="_blank">speckling</a>” and noise due to reflectance from rough surfaces and corners (a good <a href="https://youtu.be/u2bUKEi9It4" target="_blank">recent video overview</a> of SAR). But, its side-looking orientation enables its high range (or “cross-track”) resolution, and when paired with elevation maps it can be used to reconstruct 3D models of the observation area—an <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/join-mission/training/english/introduction-synthetic-aperture-radar" target="_blank">intro to SAR course from NASA</a>. Commercial applications of high-resolution SAR data have been speculated on (including your usual suspects of maritime tracking, crop monitoring, defense intelligence, and climate, with compelling all-weather natural disaster response added to the mix), but we don’t have many examples of real-world commercial use-cases just yet. Related: the <a href="https://asf.alaska.edu/#" target="_blank">Alaska Satellite Facility</a> has a good repository of SAR data available if you’d like to experiment with some yourself.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" title="" target="_blank"> <img alt="" src="https://mcusercontent.com/e215b9e6f9a105b2c34f627a3/images/c4984c9b-9c36-45b2-aaea-f57a94b357f4.jpg" width="564"> </a></td></tr><tr><td><p>A <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/capella-space-releases-the-highest-resolution-commercial-sar-imagery-in-the-world-876646188.html" target="_blank">SAR image</a> of a floating Chinese solar farm including panels, apparently laid out to resemble a fish.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">¶</a><strong id="all-the-missions-on-transporter-1">All the missions on Transporter-1.</strong> So what was in the flotilla of 143 satellites launched on SpaceX’s Jan 24th Transporter-1 rideshare mission?

<p><strong>Pipenv</strong> is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds (bundler, composer, npm, cargo, yarn, etc.) to the Python world. <em>Windows is a first-class citizen, in our world.</em></p>
<p>It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the ever-important <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code>, which is used to produce deterministic builds.</p>
<p>Pipenv is primarily meant to provide users and developers of applications with an easy method to setup a working environment. For the distinction between libraries and applications and the usage of <code><span>setup.py</span></code> vs <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> to define dependencies, see <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setuppy"><span>☤ Pipfile vs setup.py</span></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"><img alt="a short animation of pipenv at work" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jlusk/855d611bbcfa2b159839db73d07f6ce9/raw/7f5743401809f7e630ee8ff458faa980e19924a0/pipenv.gif"></a></p><p>The problems that Pipenv seeks to solve are multi-faceted:</p>
<ul>
<li>You no longer need to use <code><span>pip</span></code> and <code><span>virtualenv</span></code> separately. They work together.</li>
<li>Managing a <code><span>requirements.txt</span></code> file can be problematic, so Pipenv uses <code><span>Pipfile</span></code> and <code><span>Pipfile.lock</span></code> to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.</li>
<li>Hashes are used everywhere, always. Security. Automatically expose security vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Strongly encourage the use of the latest versions of dependencies to minimize security risks <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities">arising from outdated components</a>.</li>
<li>Give you insight into your dependency graph (e.g. <code><span>$</span> <span>pipenv</span> <span>graph</span></code>).</li>
<li>Streamline development workflow by loading <code><span>.env</span></code> files.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can quickly play with Pipenv right in your browser:</p>

<h2>Install Pipenv Today!<a href="#install-pipenv-today" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you already have Python and pip, you can easily install Pipenv into your home directory:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install --user pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or, if you’re using Fedora 28:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo dnf install pipenv
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It’s possible to install Pipenv with Homebrew on MacOS, or with Linuxbrew on Linux systems. However, <strong>this is now discouraged</strong>, because updates to the brewed Python distribution will break Pipenv, and perhaps all virtual environments managed by it. You’ll then need to re-install Pipenv at least. If you want to give it a try despite this warning, use:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>
I've been using Kubernetes for almost a year now and, to be honest, I like the experience so far. Most of my use cases were rather trivial and thanks to its declarative approach, Kubernetes makes deploying and scaling stateless services pretty simple. I usually just describe my application in a YAML file as a set of interconnected services, feed it to Kubernetes, and let the built-in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loops</a> bring the state of the cluster closer to the desired state by creating or destroying some resources for me automagically.</p>
<p>However, many times I've heard that <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/the-staying-power-of-kubernetes-with-kelsey-hightower/">the real power of Kubernetes comes with its extensibility</a>. Kubernetes designed for automation. It brings a lot of useful automation out of the box. But it also provides extension points that can be used to customize Kubernetes capabilities. The cleverness of the Kubernetes design is that it encourages you to keep the extensions feel native! So when I stumbled upon the first few Kubernetes Operators on my Ops way, I could not even recognize that I'm dealing with custom logic...</p>
<p>In this article, I'll try to take a closer look at the Operators pattern, see which Kubernetes parts are involved in operators implementation, and what makes operators feel like first-class Kubernetes citizens. Of course, with as many pictures as possible.
<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-objects-and-controllers">Kubernetes Objects and Controllers</h2>
<p>Everything in Kubernetes seems to revolve around <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/">objects</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">controllers</a>.</p>
<p>Kubernetes objects such as Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, or Events are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Objects are also used as "records of intent." By creating (or removing) objects one can describe the <em>desired</em> state of the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p><i>Objects are like data structures.</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, controllers are infinite loops that watch the <em>actual</em> and the <em>desired</em> states of your cluster. When these two states diverge, controllers start making changes aiming to bring the current state of the cluster closer to the desired one.</p>
<p><i>Controllers are like algorithms.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-control-loop-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes Control Loop">
</p>

<p>I'll get to the controllers part later in this article and now let's focus on the objects.</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-api-architecture">Kubernetes API Architecture</h2>
<p>All interactions with Kubernetes objects, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/">directly</a> or <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/">indirectly</a>, happen through <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/">Kubernetes API</a> - a highly structured masterpiece of software design.</p>
<p>There is a ton of documentation written on Kubernetes API and related topics and I spent quite some time digesting it. Since we are going to talk about the Kubernetes Operator pattern which heavily depends on the capabilities of the Kubernetes API, it's important to familiarize ourselves with the API design principles first. Following is my super-condensed excerpt from the docs.</p>
<p>Kubernetes offers a RESTful declarative HTTP API. Still remember those Kubernetes objects? <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources">A collection of objects of a certain kind form an <em>API resource</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A resource is an endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores a collection of API objects of a certain kind; for example, the built-in pods resource contains a collection of Pod objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can always check the list of available API resources using <code>kubectl api-resources</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-resources
NAME          SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION   NAMESPACED   KIND
namespaces    ns           v1           false        Namespace
nodes         no           v1           false        Node
pods          po           v1           true         Pod
deployments   deploy       apps/v1      true         Deployment
jobs                       batch/v1     true         Job
...</code></pre>
<p>OK, great, we've got resources. But Kubernetes evolves quickly. What if a new attribute needs to be added to an existing resource definition? API versioning is always hard. <i>&lt;speculation mode&gt;</i>Apparently, Kubernetes API started with a common prefix <code>/api/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;resource&gt;</code> for all the API resources. However, a change in a single resource would require a whole API version bump. So, with the growth in the number of available resources, the need for some sort of grouping and subversioning emerged.<i>&lt;/speculation mode&gt;</i></p>
<p>API groups to the rescue! <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups-and-versioning">A bunch of related resources forms an API group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make it easier to evolve and to extend its API, Kubernetes implements API groups that can be enabled or disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also check the list of available API groups and their versions using <code>kubectl api-versions</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl api-versions
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
apps/v1
...</code></pre>
<p>Well, at this point, I should warn you - it seems that in the documentation, the term <em>resource</em> is often used in the meaning of an <em>object</em> (but not vice versa). So, context matters.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, objects of the same kind are distinguished by their names. So, if you start two Pods, both should get a unique name. But clusters can be pretty big and since names are supposed to be unique within a cluster, we need a mechanism to prevent collisions. Something like lots of logical clusters within one physical cluster. Allow me to introduce you to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#when-to-use-multiple-namespaces"><em>namespaces</em></a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, API objects are fully qualified by their API group, resource type, namespace (unless cluster-scoped), and name.</p>
<p>Have you become totally confused by this time? No, worries, I've got a <del>simple</del> diagram for you 🙈</p>

    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-structure-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API structure"></p><p><i>Kubernetes API structure.</i></p>
</div>

<p>So, a quick summary - we've learned about objects, resources, groups, and namespaces. But what's up with the promised customization?</p>
<h2 id="kubernetes-custom-resources">Kubernetes Custom Resources</h2>
<p>It seems like there is <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-api-machinery/README.md">a great deal of effort</a> in keeping the Kubernetes API coherent but extensible.</p>
<p>What do I mean by <em>coherent</em> here? Kubernetes API consists of endpoints called <em>resources</em>. These API resources adhere to a set of common requirements - they are nouns and manipulated in a declarative manner (RESTful CRUD), they should be updated relatively infrequently and be reasonably small in size, their names should be <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names">valid DNS subdomains</a>, etc.</p>
<p>These restrictions allow unifying the resource workflows. For instance, you can get, describe, or update a collection of Pods in pretty much the same way as a collection of Services, Nodes, or RBAC roles:</p>
<pre><code>$ kubectl get pods
$ kubectl get services
$ kubectl get roles

$ kubectl describe pods  # or services, or roles

$ kubectl edit pods  # or services, or roles</code></pre>
<p>Not only <code>kubectl</code> benefits from this uniformity. Here is a full list of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#common-features">common features</a> enabled by the unified design:</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/kubernetes-operator-pattern/kube-api-common-features-3000-opt.png" width="100%" alt="Kubernetes API common features"></p>
</div>

<p>It's pretty handy, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, if I were to extend the API, it'd be reasonable for me to expect that my endpoints would benefit from this common functionality as well. But that would mean that the API extension should be done by adding more resources!</p>
<p>And indeed, in Kubernetes, one can easily register <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-resources"><em>custom resources</em></a>. The procedure is fully dynamic and doesn't require restarting or updating the API server.</p>
<p>How such a custom resource can be added? Well, again, it's Kubernetes! Of course, by interacting with another, already existing resource! There is a special API resource called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions">CustomResourceDefinition (CRD)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The CustomResourceDefinition API resource allows you to define custom resources. Defining a CRD object creates a new custom resource with a name and schema that you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#create-a-customresourcedefinition">from another documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you create a new CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-create-custom-resource">How to Create Custom Resource</h2>
<p>Let's try to create a custom resource. Remember, a resource specifies a certain kind of Kubernetes object. Canonically, objects possess some attributes. So, our CustomResourceDefinition should be mostly concerned with describing the attributes of our future resource. Additionally, it's good to know that custom resources can be either namespaced or cluster-scoped. This is specified in the CRD's scope field.</p>
<pre><code>apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1

<p><strong>Friendly tracebacks</strong> - Simplified Python tracebacks translatable into

<div id="in-a-nutshell">
<h2>In a nutshell<a href="#in-a-nutshell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There exists many Python projects, including some listed below,
whose <strong>primary</strong> goal is to supplement the information
given by Python traceback to make them more useful for <strong>advanced</strong> programmers.
Friendly-traceback is <strong>not</strong> one of these projects.</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be useful for advanced programmers,
it is aimed aimed primarily at beginners and/or at users
who would like to get information about traceback in their own language.
Friendly-traceback can give more detailed information as to
<strong>where</strong> an exception occurred, <strong>what</strong> a given exception means and
<strong>why</strong> it might have occurred (sometimes adding a way to fix it.)</p>
<p>While Friendly-traceback can be used on its own with a specially
designed console, a better option would be to use it together with
GUI-based editors/IDE including Jupyter lab and notebooks.
We explain how to do so later.
For now, we just show one quick example.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-quick-look">
<h2>A quick look<a href="#a-quick-look" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, we show what happens when we use Python

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a> uses lots of <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html">GHC language extensions</a> to create the
“magic” that comes along with the framework. One the the first nonstandard language extensions
you’ll come across while developing with IHP is the fancy “@” symbol.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>action</span> <span>UsersAction</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
    users <span>&lt;-</span> query <span>@</span><span>User</span> <span>|&gt;</span> fetch
    render <span>IndexView</span> { <span>..</span> }
</code></pre></div><p><code>@User</code> appears like a normal parameter to the function, which can be highly misleading if you try and extrapolate this idea into other contexts.
When I first started working with IHP, I assumed this was the equivalent to
Swift’s <code>self</code> property on types, which gives you a <em>value</em> representing the type that can be passed around:</p><p>This is not the case however!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span>
  typeOfUser <span>=</span> <span>@</span><span>User</span>
<span>in</span>
  <span>-- parse error!</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So what’s actually happening here?</p><h3 id="whats-the-type">What’s the type?</h3><p>Say we want to test the behavior of Haskell’s <code>read</code> and <code>show</code> functions, which
each have a corresponding type class which defines which values can be passed to these functions.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>read</span> <span>::</span> (<span>Read</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> a
<span>show</span> <span>::</span> (<span>Show</span> a) <span>=&gt;</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Given any value which has both <code>Read</code> and <code>Show</code> instances defined, we should be able to convert back and forth between it and its String representation.</p><p>Let’s test for integers:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> intString <span>=</span> <span>"123"</span>
<span>read</span> intString

<span>***</span> <span>Exception:</span> <span>Prelude</span><span>.</span>read<span>:</span> no parse
</code></pre></div><p>Huh? Of course <code>read</code> should know how to parse a simple integer, right?</p><p>If you think about the above code carefully, you might notice that Haskell
has no way of knowing what type <code>read intString</code> should be! Obviously to us it
represents an integer, but in Haskell’s eyes it’s given an arbitrary string
and has no way of knowing which instance of the type class <code>Read</code> it should produce.</p><h3 id="-me-bro">@ me bro</h3><p>Type application to the rescue! The “@” symbol allows us to explicity pass
a type to the function:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>let</span> intString <span>=</span> <span>"123"</span>
<span>read</span> <span>@</span><span>Int</span> intString

<span>123</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Note, <code>@Int</code> is <strong>not a regular parameter!</strong>
The regular parameters we’re used to working with are actually called
<em>value parameters</em>, and <code>read</code> only has one: a String.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Haskell also includes <em>type parameters</em> which specify
the types that satisfy a function’s <em>constraints</em>, or the stuff before
the <code>=&gt;</code> symbol in function declarations.</p><p>Normally Haskell can do this for us:</p><pre><code>readFn :: String -&gt; Int
readFn intString = read intString

readFn "123"

123
</code></pre><p>Since the function returns an Int, the type parameter can be inferred.
In the simple example earlier however, this was not the case.</p><h2 id="type-application-in-ihp">Type Application in IHP</h2><p>Say we’re writing a script that wants to print out the name of the newest user to signup for our application.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>run</span> <span>::</span> <span>Script</span>
<span>run</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
    user <span>&lt;-</span> query <span>@</span><span>User</span> <span>|&gt;</span> orderBy <span>#</span>createdAt <span>|&gt;</span> fetchOne
    print (get <span>#</span>createdAt user)
</code></pre></div><p>To understand what <code>@User</code> is doing, we need to look at the definition of <code>query</code>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>query</span> <span>::</span> forall model table<span>.</span> table <span>~</span> <span>GetTableName</span> model <span>=&gt;</span> <span>DefaultScope</span> table <span>=&gt;</span> <span>QueryBuilder</span> table
</code></pre></div><p><code>query</code> doesn’t take any value parameters! All the info that gets passed to the function is contained in its type constraints. So if we omitted <code>@User</code>, Haskell would have no way of knowing what the <code>model</code> type should be.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Type application is extremely powerful and is used all over both the
IHP codebase and IHP applications. Understanding what’s going on when you see
the <code>@</code> symbol is a good first step for uncovering some of the “magic” behind
the framework.</p><p>Does anything else in IHP confuse you? Let me know below and I will write about
it in a future article! Thanks for reading!</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Decentralization Is a Narrative Mirage]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Technology is a concentrating force. It always has been.</p>
<p>Everybody sewed their own clothes until we built textile factories.</p>
<p>It used to take one farmer to feed four people. Now each farmer feeds 130 people.</p>
<p>Home Depot killed thousands of local hardware stores. Opendoor is replacing legions of Keller-Williams agents. Salman Khan teaches algebra to more kids than the next 10,000 math teachers combined.</p>
<p>Gold, silver, <span>USD</span>, <span>CNY</span>, and <span>EUR</span> are all converging on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Human history is a story of increasing centralization. From roaming the plains of Africa, to settling down and building homes, to buying food in central markets, to instituting courts of law. Progression is compression. <em>How can I make it so everybody isn’t making their own shirts? Deciding their own justice? Tabulating their own spreadsheets?</em></p>
<p>The internet, contrary to popular opinion, is accelerating the pace of centralization.</p>
<p>Software is centralizing in the App Store. Compute is centralizing in AWS-US-EAST-1. Culture is centralizing on TikTok. Stock trades are centralizing in Citadel’s dark pool. Politics are centralizing around personality. Work and cities are centralizing online.</p>
<p>Decentralization is a narrative mirage because three trends are frequently misinterpreted: the downfall of institutions, the death of the gatekeeper, and remote work.</p>
<p>These aren’t representative of decentralization, but instead are examples of increasing concentration.</p>
<h3 id="institutions-are-failing.">1.<span></span> <span>“</span>Institutions are failing.”</h3>
<p><a href="https://secondbreakfast.co/personality-is-the-force-majeure-of-the-internet">Personality is the force majeure of the internet</a>. In a noisy world, it’s much easier to diligence an individual than it is to understand institutional motives. <em>Who supports NPR? Who’s the <span>NYT</span><span></span><span>’</span>s customer? Advertisers? <span>PR</span> people? Me? What are we being sold?</em></p>
<p>Institutions aren’t crumbling because of decentralization, but rather the opposite: institutional power is being compressed into personalities.</p>
<p>Trump became the <span>GOP</span>. <span>AOC</span> is becoming the <span>DNC</span>. Dave Portnoy is becoming <span>ESPN</span>. Sam Harris is now <span>NPR</span>. Elon is Tesla.</p>
<p>Organizational power is inherently decentralized. Shareholders vote for board members. Boards approve plans. Plans coordinate across loosely-coupled internal orgs.</p>
<p>But individual power, like autocratic government, is singular.</p>
<p>Directives no longer need to flow through layers of hierarchy. Tesla no longer needs a network of dealers to sell cars on <a href="https://tesla.com/">tesla.com</a>, nor do they need an army of salespeople. Why listen to Bob at the local showroom when you can follow Elon on Twitter?</p>
<p>It’s the same in politics. We used to elect state representatives who would elect electors in the legislature who would elect a President. Then communication and transportation improved. We got railroads and national radio, so we put the Presidential candidates directly on the ballot.</p>
<p>Nowadays the President doesn’t even need <span>TV</span> stations: they can instantly drop messages into the pockets of <span>80M</span> followers.</p>
<p>Betting on the internet means betting against institutions,<a href="#footnote-11TX" id="ref-11TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> not because institutions are exploding supernovas but because institutions are imploding black holes.</p>
<h3 id="the-gatekeepers-are-dead.">2.<span></span> <span>“</span>The gatekeepers are dead.”</h3>
<p>It’s true, gatekeepers are dead. It’s a huge improvement over the pre-Internet era.</p>
<p>I never learned about Richard Dawkins growing up. Then I went down a Carl Sagan <em>Pale Blue Dot</em> rabbit hole. I discovered Christopher Hitchens talking about evolution, consumed all of his religious debates, and then came across this Oxford evolutionary biologist who wore funny ties. <em>The Selfish Gene</em> fundamentally changed the way I view the world.</p>
<p>YouTube extends far beyond space videos. There’s debates about quantum theory, <span>DIY</span> construction how-to’s, makeup tutorials, and an unbelievable amount of unboxing videos.</p>
<p>The best part? There’s no school board deciding what you can and can’t watch and there’s no <span>MTV</span> exec telling David Dobrik what he can and can’t upload.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think the unlimited nature of content is a decentralizing force. Yet the reality is that winning content in an unlimited world is watched over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift can reach billions of listeners, Salman Khan can teach algebra to millions of students, the best Stack Overflow answers get upvoted thousands of times.</p>
<p>Imagine if San Francisco had no zoning rules. There’d be cranes and giant skyscrapers everywhere. The city would be reaching Tokyo-level density, concentrating people in the Bay Area from across the country.</p>
<p>The internet is a supercharged no-zoning Bay Area. YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, Shopify are all limitless. Their success is exponential, like the weight of gravity, pulling in more and more eyeballs.</p>
<p>The gap between first place and second place is far more pronounced online than it ever was offline. 30-45% of all e-commerce goes through Amazon. Walmart managed to handle only 9% of physical retail at their peak.<a href="#footnote-21TX" id="ref-21TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Power is shifting to the dancer who can get featured by TikTok’s algorithm, to the business that can place first in Google’s results, to the reseller that pays the most to top Amazon’s catalog, to the singer that can get featured in Spotify’s <em>Discover Weeklies</em>.</p>
<p>The long tail of content is a distraction from the reality: online power is concentrating in an extreme power law. Yes, anybody can build a following. But the winners dwarf the long tail.</p>
<p>After all, audiences are so concentrated that it only took three companies to silence the sitting <span>POTUS</span>.</p>
<h3 id="but-what-about-remote-work">3.<span></span> <span>“</span>But what about remote work?”</h3>
<p>I miss going into Industrious. I’d wake up, walk to FiDi, pour myself a cup of coffee in a grey mug, sit in a mid-century modern green chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>When I flew to Chicago, I’d take a train to the Fulton Market Industrious, pour myself coffee in a grey mug, sit on a mid-century chair, and get to work.</p>
<p>Fly to Atlanta? Ride to Ponce. Coffee, grey mug, green chair, work.</p>
<p>New York? Union Square. Coffee. Chair. Work.</p>
<p>As people move their work lives online, the experience everywhere is going to be the same. Morning ride on the Peloton, get to WeWork, drink some Blue Bottle, hop on a video call, order groceries from Instacart, rinse and repeat. The only difference will be whether we see palm trees or wildfire smoke out the window.</p>
<p>The<span></span> <span>“</span>everyone is leaving <span>SF</span><span></span><span>”</span> narrative isn’t about decentralization, it’s about centralizing online. Everybody is on Zoom now.<span></span> <span>“</span>Remote work” doesn’t mean you can now live some exotic life in a faraway place, it means that people in Birmingham can live the same as those in Cow Hollow. And work for the same companies, too.</p>
<p>Not only are we all working on Zoom, but we’re all shopping on the same<span></span> <span>“</span>hip” street, the one with Warby Parker and Bonobos and Lululemon and La Colombe all lined up side by side. Sub-in Blue Bottle, and I’ll tell you if you’re east or west of the Mississippi.<a href="#footnote-31TX" id="ref-31TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of it is that capital is cheap and management can be centralized, so chains are able to grow quickly nationwide without leaning on franchise models.<a href="#footnote-41TX" id="ref-41TX" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>But the other part is that our tastes as Americans are compressing. Every town has incredible breweries, third wave coffee, Trader Joe’s, and a Costco out in the suburbs. We’re all watching Netflix and Charli D’Amelio. We’re all peddling to the same bike instructors as Biden. How much longer until we all lose our regional accents, too?</p>
<h3 id="uploading">Uploading…</h3>
<p>Everything is shifting online. From how we find office space, to get rides, to feed ourselves, to exercise, to work and to live.</p>
<p>The meme that this constitutes<span></span> <span>“</span>decentralization” is like the ocean on the edge of the Saharan horizon. It is an illusion.</p>
<p>The spectrum of opinions, of tastes, of behaviors is compressing. The platforms and personalities with power will continue to grow in size. The power law of the internet remains irrefutable.</p>
<p>Soon one farmer will feed 1,300 people, robots will sew our Nikes, there will be one nationwide math teacher and a single wealth ledger.</p>
<p>And our lives will be fully uploaded.</p>

If you’re starting with this one, you may want to have a look at: </em><a href="https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager"><span><em>https://www.jlgoodwin.com/words-pictures/2020/9/17/management-the-job-of-a-manager</em></span></a></p><p>Amazing, talented, hard-working, accomplished folks who’ve reported to me over the years have asked: “What do I need to do to get to the next level?” In most cases, because I needed them, I have to admit I have sometimes stopped short of complete candor. If I could have, I would have said: “Find the job you want to have at another company and then quit this one.” There is also the version of: “Find the job you want at this company and then transfer to that one.” I’ve never stood in the way of anyone leaving my team and getting their next job, and I’ve always helped in any way I could to make it happen. So, my career advice is “Be a quitter.” There are some dimensions to that reductionist statement…</p><p><em>My very first programming job was when I was sixteen years old, when I worked for a company creating educational games for the TRS-80, Apple II, Atari, and IBM PCs. When I had worked for them for about three years and was heading to college, they were still paying me eight dollars an hour. I was as good or better than their older programmers so I asked them for a raise to fifteen dollars an hour. They had recently started to become more of a “business” and had hired a biz school grad to manage their operations. He wouldn’t go for it. I quit and took a job cooking in a restaurant that happened to be on the ground floor of my girlfriend’s dorm building for fifteen dollars an hour. I got some good cooking experience and a few months later I got another software job with a company that did portfolio accounting for big Wall Street firms. They paid me a lot more than fifteen dollars an hour, and I later dropped out of college to work for them full time.</em></p><p>Right from the start of your career I recommend that you pay attention to what engages you about your job and what turns you off. Make pro/con lists at some regular intervals, perhaps at quarterly review time. Are you getting enough of the pros from your job vs. the cons? Are there opportunities to shift the balance in your current role? Are there things you could add that would be pros that you’re not doing at all? Are there things that you’ve only done once in that last quarter that you really enjoyed? Try to do that again. Don’t pay that much attention to what you “should” do, pay attention to what you want to do.&nbsp;</p><p>If money is on your list, find out what you’re worth by spending some time getting some other offers. Don’t try to coerce your manager into paying you more by dropping offer letters in front of them. Instead, just talk to them about what you think you should be making in your current role and why.</p><p>If you really don’t see a way to pursue the things that motivate you via your current role, then this is a signal to start looking inside and outside the company for your next role.</p><p><em>I was a principal software engineer on a large team writing business productivity software. I wanted to be a software architect. I had been working fairly autonomously on a feature that touched every damn thing in the product. So you could say I was already doing software architecture work. But, because I was young they were reluctant to promote me. I saw another team that was fucking up wildly and they desperately needed architectural guidance. So I talked to my boss and asked to help them out. It was a huge mess to unravel but I managed to create a good architecture out of it and rewrite a lot of it. I also got the team members contributing better as well. After that, when I asked for a promotion they gave it to me. Partly because they acknowledged that I was qualified, and partly because I owned two large feature areas and they couldn’t afford to lose me.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em>If you want to get to the next level, ask for next level responsibilities when there is an opportunity. A new project, a new sub-team, a crisis that needs to be sorted out, etc.--any of these are places where you can volunteer to take on more scope. Essentially that is what “career growth” is: getting more scope of influence. This kind of informal tryout is good for you and for your boss. It lets you figure out if these are really the things that motivate you and whether you are any good at them. It lets your boss see you as the next level without committing to a promotion. Of course some bosses are assholes and (even if you do well) will just try to use you again in this role without a promotion. I would say that risk is worth it to get the tryout and if you have an asshole boss you should (you guessed it) quit.</p><p>I can’t tell you the number of people who have pursued me for promotions who weren’t good at their current job. I’m sure that works with incompetent managers who want to just pass their problems along to other folks while failing up themselves, but I’m not talking about them. You’ll know you’re great at your current job when the 360 feedback from peers, supervisors, and stakeholders confirms this--that’s when you should try to get the next job. A real challenge in this is that sometimes you’re good at something that you don’t like all that much. You are left with a choice: Pursue the thing you’re strong at or perhaps go for something that makes you happy that you’re just okay at. I don’t know the right answer; you have to choose.</p><p><em>After some years at a Very Large Multinational Technology Company I had reached a point where I was flying back and forth across the United States with PowerPoint decks telling “stories” to partner companies. I wasn’t learning anything except how to get the most frequent flyer points. I was not happy. I went looking for a company that was smaller, more focused, and where I could be an individual contributor again. I found a little place doing cool work that I was interested in. They were a small tight knit group of really talented folks. The interview was really hard. I learned a lot about truly collaborating on a project, taking feedback, and using asynchronous communication effectively. I got deep into Linux, Python, test automation, Windows distributed security, and about a thousand other things. I started coding for fun again during that job and haven’t really stopped since. There was a lot of blunt feedback, but in response to that, I got even better than I thought I was going in.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The worst place to learn anything is a place where you are the smartest person in the room. When you’re interviewing companies (or other teams), one of your goals should be to see if you are going to learn anything from them. That education is worth more than money. Learning is what gives drive and interest to your career. If you’re not learning, you’re sliding backwards. This is why chasing easy money, and hopping from money-wasting startup to money-wasting startup, is not a good way to develop a strong career. It isn’t always easy to be learning on the job, and it comes with stress and sometimes uncomfortable feedback, but I think it is worth it in the long run.</p><p><em>I was leading a scrum team at a small e-commerce company and as part of a project we were doing, someone had to write some deployment scripts. This involved writing some shell script and a little work in Lua on Nginx. When the task came up during planning, the task wasn’t claimed so I assigned it to one of the more senior engineers. The next several stand up meetings this engineer was in a very bad mood with me. I finally had a talk with them and they informed me that they were a “Java Engineer” and that they didn’t appreciate being given tasks that weren’t Java. I told them that their job title was “Software Engineer,” and that they would use whatever software tool was required to build the systems we needed. Needless to say, this conversation didn’t help them in their quest for advancement. I can only imagine what has happened to this person since then, with the rise of JavaScript on the backend and the long dragged out death of Java.</em></p><p>It is okay to get to a certain point and just stay there because you’re happy, challenged, and still learning. A key thing to be wary of in these contexts is to not let the market leave you behind. Don’t be a Java engineer or a Python engineer: be a Software Engineer. Be comfortable in multiple environments and idioms. In the software field, languages and tools and operating systems go out of style. It isn’t that there is really something better, it is just that people tend to herd towards new things periodically. You should pay attention and update your skills, put the new tech into your current job (or get a new job with new tech). I’ve had to lay folks off in the past and there is nothing sadder than “senior” folks, whose skills are a decade out of date, trying to attain the same level in a market that has moved on. You become at best an entry level person with commensurate lower salary expectations.</p><p>Don’t take a management role if you don’t like it and/or you don’t have any aptitude for it. There are plenty of ways to figure this out before taking a management role. Being a great engineer is not an important qualification for being a great manager. Many companies make this stupid assumption because they were founded by engineers, and they typically have a lot of crappy managers (who are former engineers) who really don’t like managing people. You are much better off solving your money problems or level problems inside the engineering track than switching over to the management track. Also, the employees that would have to suffer under you will appreciate you staying in the engineering track.</p><p>In the long run, it is better to have the right role than to always have a steadily increasing salary. Of course, this assumes that you have your finances in order and can afford to do this. I would say that being able to have this option is very useful in career progression. I’ve done it more than once, because as a great …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/google.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/google.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-sign-out.png" alt="Google warning: 'Couldn't sign you in'"></p><p>I saw the above warning using <a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi</a>: a successful and powerful Chromium based browser. There's nothing insecure about it. I tried to fix the problem by disabling all extensions, clearing all browser data, and enabling “less secure app access” in the Google account settings. Alas. The only solution I found was reinstalling the browser. But after having done so—five times—each time when clearing the cookies, or enabling a VPN, it wouldn't let me sign in again. Then the following email found my inbox.</p>

    <p><img src="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/media/google-warning.png" alt="Google warning: someone knows the password to your linked Google account"></p><p>“Someone knows the password to your linked Google Account”… Me. It was <em>me</em>! Obviously <em>I</em> know the password to my linked Google account. Forced to change my password I was duly annoyed. I realized how dependent I was. If Google unpredictably revokes access to your account, you can't log into anything else of their services: YouTube, Gmail, Play Store, Docs, Drive, Calendar, etc. Fortunately I already did a partial Google and social media exodus. Nevertheless, even when only using YouTube and Google Play, losing access startled me. Therefore, because I don't want to be put in this position again, I completed the exodus: discarding the need for a Google account.</p>

    <p>A quick aside, I have nothing against monopolies as a general rule. Usually they grow so big because of a significantly superior service <sup>(1)</sup>. But as convenient as they may be—even though their products aren't superior anymore—if their power goes to their head and they start pulling insidious shenanigans, like using false claims to deter people from browsers other than Chrome, then I'm out.</p>

    <p>So that's exactly what I did and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. Believe it or not but my phone is more responsive and the battery lasts longer. Although the former might be due to the factory reset, I assume the latter has to do with the decrease in background processes due to 1. removing my Google account 2. subsequently disabling Google Play Store 3. disabling everything in the settings tab called Google services &amp; preferences. Digital minimalism, it's so incredibly satisfying. You should try it. Your life was perfectly fine before you had all that extra stuff to worry about (or pay for); I learnt that from my teacher, Diogenes of Sinope, 404 – 323 BC.</p>

          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Alternatives to Google.</h2>
    <p>Diogenes would suggest living on the streets, but I'm unsure if that's feasible, and you'd still be overwhelmed by ads. So what to do? One could completely avoid Google as there is plenty competition to choose from. A quick search for “Google alternatives” or a peek at <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com/">No More Google</a> or <a href="https://degoogle.jmoore.dev/">degoogle</a> can suffice. Although, realistically, one will want to keep using some of their services, preferably without an account. As was the case for me.</p>

    <h3>YouTube.</h3>
    <p>YouTube has a lot of content nowhere else to be found. Fortunately one doesn't need an account (yet) to simply watch these videos. However, sometimes logging in is required. To <strong>circumvent logging in</strong>, use the YouTube front-end <a href="https://invidio.us/">invidio.us</a>, and select an instance such as ytprivate.com. It uses YouTube in the background, but discards the bullshit, making the website much faster. Just enter a search term, or copy-paste the YouTube URL or video ID, and you're good to go. If you require <strong>playlists</strong> or <strong>subscriptions</strong>, Invidious supports that too if you register. Importing or exporting data from other Invidious instances is possible as well.</p>

    <p>If you want to manually create a playlist on YouTube without an account, append the following URL with the YouTube video IDs separated by commas, for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=xUozVQVt1xI,ed0fRdTma9I.</p>
    
    <p>When on <strong>mobile</strong>, <a href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a> is the way. There are other YouTube front-ends, but I strongly recommend NewPipe because: it is highly configurable, it supports background play on a locked phone, it features easy downloading, it has <em>no</em> ads, it works hand in hand with PeerTube and Invidious, it's super fast, etc.</p>
    
    <h3>Google Play Store.</h3>
    <p>The Google Play store is something I was most worried about. I assumed using “their” apps necessitated a Google account. Not necessarily. <strong>The free apps don't require an account, the paid apps do</strong>. For example, I purchased Wolfram Alpha but can't install it without Google Play Store. And even if I could, I'd need my Google account as a receipt to reactivate it. In total I have 14 apps and one digital book I paid for. But as time passed I found better and free alternatives to all of them, or I merely donated to support their decision to refuse ads, not their premium functions. However, I can understand if this is a dealbreaker to those who are dependent on non-free apps.</p>
      
    <p>Anyway, to install an app you just need an .apk file. But to avoid a time-consuming process, there are alternative app catalogues such as <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a> and <a href="https://auroraoss.com/app_info.php?app_id=1"><strong>Aurora Store</strong></a>, these will serve most of your needs. I suggest perusing F-Droid first because its apps are FOSS (Free and Open Source Software); more than half of mine are on it. Here's a list of everyting I use: <a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/software.html">quitfacebook.org/file/software.html</a>.</p>

    <p>Not going to lie, it feels good to release the shackles; Google Play Store is disabled and everything works just fine. However, Google Play <em>services</em> apparently needs to remain enabled for some crucial functionalities. I can live with that, for now.</p>

    <h3>Gmail.</h3>
    <p>I'm only keeping this account just in case I need the key to the dungeon. Otherwise I use <a href="https://protonmail.com/">ProtonMail</a> which is developed at CERN <sup>(2)</sup>; 'nuff said? Sure there are plenty of other providers, but man, developed at CERN, that's like a Vulcan salute to Trekkies.</p>

    <p>🖖</p>

    <h3>Google Chrome.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://vivaldi.com/">Vivaldi Browser</a>'s quality <em>does</em> match up to its name—and we all know <em>Four Seasons</em>. I could throw around superlatives all day, but I won't spoil the pleasant surprise. What got <em>me</em> to click “set as default browser” was Vivaldi's unmatched simultaneous customizability <em>and</em> speed. Not surprisingly, it has a thriving community forum.</p>


    <h3>Google Drive.</h3>
    <p>The only thing I used Google Drive for was backing up contacts. This can easily be replaced by exporting a .vcf file. Similarly, before a factory reset, I just manually use the export function of the few apps I want backups from.</p>

    <p>But what in the case of a hard drive crash? For the most important files I use a directory that's immediately synced to <a href="https://mega.nz/">MEGA</a> by default. For instance, I'm writing this page on a file that's sent to the cloud each time it's saved. This is probably commonplace and trivial information for IT enthusiasts, but I'm certain that's not most people.</p>

    <h3>Google search.</h3>
    <p>I admit I haven't found any search engine with better results than Google, despite its bias. However, you can have your cake and eat it too with <a href="https://www.startpage.com/">Startpage</a>. This search engine uses Google but adds privacy.<sup>(3)</sup> If you want to avoid Google completely, use <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>—but let's call it <a href="https://duck.com/">duck.com</a> from now on so we can say “duck it” instead of “google it”.</p>

    <p>Ideally, just be efficient and use shortcuts for multiple search engines.</p>

    <h3>Google Translate.</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.deepl.com/">DeepL</a>. The translations it produces are astounding; single words as well as full text translations. Try it, I'm confident you'll confirm that it beats Google.</p>

    <h3>Google Ads.</h3>
    <p>Fuck ads, and I'm being polite. To find out how I block all of them I suggest you read my post “<a href="https://www.quitfacebook.org/file/adblocking.html">Ad blocking, or how to use the Web properly.</a>”</p>

    <h2>Why do I care?</h2>
    <p>I don't have a coherent answer yet; the problem is multifold and my expertise is lacking. Regardless, things don't feel right. For one, it greatly bothers me that there is a vast collection of fantastic software that doesn't get the attention it deserves. Especially the ones made by praiseworthy developers who refuse ads and trackers. Frequently they're hidden behind products of those who can spend the most on marketing, or they suffer traffic loss by biased search results. Consequently, these virtuous mindsets don't get incentivized as they earn significantly less money. Developers with a backbone deserve to be rewarded more. Additionally, the dumbing down of devices and software decreases all-around tech savviness and makes us more reliant while hypocritically increasing the attitude of taking things for granted.</p>

    <p>To add fuel to the fire, we've become addicted to convenience because monopolies handed us everything on silver plate in return for our data, all so the consumption of whatever can be increased. It sounds like a conspiracy, but it isn't; data is seen as the new oil for just that reason: manipulation. Call me old-fashioned all you want, but I consider wilful manipulation evil. The fact that Facebook is still around after all their <em>known</em> scandals proves how hollow we've become.</p>

Browsing through companies that have recently IPO’d or raised $100M+ rounds — where one would expect a company to be able to hire junior developers — all I can find are jobs that require at least three or more years of experience or are explicitly only hiring “Senior” or “Developer II” or higher.</p><p>I have been working with bootcamp graduates and community-college graduates for years. But from my vantage point, when growth companies hire people with no development job experience, they are usually hiring top-tier, four-year college graduates. (There are some exceptions! Twitter’s <a href="https://careers.twitter.com/en/university.html">internship program</a> is admirable, although I don’t know in practice how restrictive the admissions end up being).<a href="https://twitter.com/shaft/status/1355696154990628864"></a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768"></a>One can understand wanting to make sure that the first few hires into any department have enough experience to build and maintain high quality software, except that</p><p>a) that often doesn’t prevent terrible technical debt, and</p><p>b) no one ever changes the expectations over time.</p><p>And so the culture just becomes, “we only hire people with experience.” I am a huge fan of <a href="https://www.segment.com/">Segment</a> (and a happy customer for more than five years), but despite their senior-developer-packed engineering roster, they seem to have to rebuild their <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">entire architecture</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/how-segment-redesigned-its-core-systems-to-solve-an-existential-scaling-crisis/">every</a> <a href="https://segment.com/blog/rebuilding-our-infrastructure/">few</a> years. Every company starts by hiring seniors; most seem to keep hiring seniors, and many have to keep throwing away code constantly.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BsxIM1LBghJkWOwT56C-wwa7lGYJbB9sJPYjYd-A2Dq7zKkJVO98_I3qSOZazzGzxkJkx_gqA4KBK1lm0st213MAaiRfakQxgcACtziqc7hsW5z3wfbtzmbN87DR9bB4NtACKSi2" alt=""></figure><p>Everyone agrees that talent is scarce, and that hires often fail — and that failure is expensive. Why don’t companies ever take a conscious look at how to build talent instead of buying it?</p><p>Put another way, it’s ironic that an industry that tends to want to build everything instead of buying it chooses to buy the absolute most expensive thing on the market: talent.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-the-problems-with-senior-developers">The Problems with Senior Developers</h2><p><strong>It is a fallacy that only hiring senior developers will lead to better results than hiring many junior developers</strong>. There are bad things about senior developers that no one should want in their organization, and without juniors to counterbalance, you’ll be overindexed to these downsides.</p><h4 id="h-senior-skills-can-stagnate">Senior skills can stagnate</h4><p>The most common error I see senior developers make comes, ironically, from their prior successes, combined with the pace of technology.</p><p>Most developers at the beginning of their careers are good at knowing and using most of the best practices at that time. But there is no continuing education in software development, and compensation is tied to shipping, not learning. So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.

<p><em>This article on NewSpace in Latin America was developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecuadorian Space Agency (EXA)</a>, a participant in the <a href="https://satsearch.co/membership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satsearch membership program</a>.</em></p>



<p><em>It includes a discussion of Latin America’s position in the global industry along with a deeper case study investigation into two example companies from the region; <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> and <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>.</em></p>



<hr>



<p>In recent years the space economy has grown at a rapid rate. According to the <a href="https://www.spacefoundation.org/2019/03/18/space-foundation-2018-annual-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Foundation 2018 Annual Report</a>; in 2017 it totalled USD 383.5 billion worldwide and it is projected to keep growing.</p>



<p>In addition, the report highlights that during 2017 there was a 7% increase in orbital launch attempts around the world, a 100% increase in the total number of spacecraft deployed and a 200% increase in the number of commercial spacecraft deployed.</p>



<p>As this trend continues it is reminiscent of what transpired with the aviation industry around 50 years ago. After several years of heavy regulation and the sector being dominated by a few airlines, 1970s deregulation and lower costs resulted in a huge increase in competition. This brought in new carriers and routes, leading to an increase in passenger numbers that built the multibillion-dollar industry that connects the world today.</p>



<p>We’re see the same pattern unfold right in front of our eyes with the rapid privatization and commercialization of the space sector. A new age of space exploration is emerging; one that is no longer dominated by few countries with large and established space programs, but rather by a large group of private companies, startups and other entrepreneurs that are ready to take the next steps to push the boundaries of humanity while also benefiting and profiting from space. This is known as “<a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2019-02-26-lets-talk-about-newspace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NewSpace</a>”.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Beyond the traditional powers</h2>



<p>NewSpace is opening the doors for other regions and countries, aside from the traditional dominant player of the United States of America, to take a leap of faith and start shaping the future of space exploration.</p>



<p>These nations now have the potential to become a driving force, innovate, and act, or else they risk the chance of missing out on the financial and social benefits that the NewSpace sector provides.</p>



<p>This is particularly true for the Latin American region where space exploration has always been thought of as something of a luxurious enterprise. For a region comprised mainly of emerging economies, government run and financed space agencies have always been a difficult option, as funds and resources are primarily allocated to priorities such as healthcare and education.</p>



<p>Although these priorities are perfectly valid of course, not taking part in the NewSpace industry does further the position of Latin America as an ‘underdeveloped’ region. Privatization and commercialization of space technologies in the growing, connected global market is therefore key for other private and civilian enterprises, to take the burden off the government and immerse their respective countries in the NewSpace era.</p>



<p>A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis on greater participation in the NewSpace industry in Latin America was performed in order to better characterize the prospects for the region, considering the historical, industrial, and political realities that it faces. This analysis also sets a roadmap for NewSpace integration of new actors, indicating where they can optimize their efforts and where they should be careful.</p>

<h2>Companies active in NewSpace in Latin America</h2>



<p>Two entities, <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> and <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>, have emerged as leaders in the region, proving that even for companies coming from developing countries, it is possible to be part of the global space market. These companies are an effective case study showing that achieving NewSpace integration in the region is possible.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency (EXA)</a> is a not-for-profit, non-governmental institution that follows a civilian space exploration model. It has become established as Ecuador’s first space agency and is tasked with executing the nation’s space program.</p>



<p><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> is based in Argentina and is the first vertically integrated geospatial analytics company in the country.</p>



<p>Both EXA and Satellogic were responsible for the conception, design, and manufacturing of their first and second national CubeSats; NEE-01 PEGASO and NEE-02 KRYSAOR for Ecuador, and CubeBug-1 and CubeBug-2 for Argentina. These satellites served as effective technology demonstrators that now drive the commercialization of proprietary technologies in the case of EXA, and the provision of Earth Observation and analytics services in the case of <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a>.</p>



<p>The sections below include more information on each of these businesses.</p>



<hr>



<h2>EXA – helping Ecuador join the list of countries with space programs</h2>



<p>As a research and development institution <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> has trusted <a href="http://www.cubesat.market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CubeSat.Market</a>, a commercial space company, with the promotion, marketing, and commercialization of its space products.</p>



<p>These products range from power systems to all-in-one EPS, OBC, and SDR systems. <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Find out more about this portfolio here</a>.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="582" src="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio.png 683w, https://blog-admin.satsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/210203_satsearch_exa_product_portfolio-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"></a></figure></div>







<p>EXA´s products have been chosen by several regional and international partners to fly in different missions to Earth’s orbit, to the moon and beyond.</p>



<p>One of these clients is <a href="https://www.irvinecubesat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Irvine Cubesat STEM Program</a> which is developing a fleet of 12 satellites with <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/exa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EXA</a> as its primary supplier. Another client is the <a href="https://www.unam.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)</a> that is developing its very own K´OTO spacecraft with the EXA spacecraft bus at its core.</p>



<p>In addition, EXA has developed a <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-01-22-optical-communications-for-small-satellites-and-cubesats-product-roundup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laser communication module for CubeSats</a> capable of transmitting up to 100 mbps at a maximum power of 25 Watts. This module is looking to transform how communication is performed from space to ground and in-orbit, particularly between satellites in a constellation.</p>



<p>EXA is an excellent case study into how a Latin American country such as Ecuador can lead by example, producing commercial technology for the global space market while bringing the whole region along into NewSpace.</p>

<h2>Satellogic – global growth from Argentina</h2>



<p><a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> has grown into a multinational company with offices and clients all over the world. They are currently building a 60-satellite constellation that will be able to remap the entire planet each week, providing customers with high-resolution images and processed analytics that will allow for daily decision-making support.</p>



<p>This constellation is made possible due to the creation of the NewSat microsatellite, a small, light, and inexpensive platform that carries both a sub-meter resolution multispectral imaging instrument and a 25-meter resolution hyperspectral camera.</p>



<p>Since 2016 <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> has launched 18 NewSats, with significant improvements generation to generation, totalling 21 spacecraft in orbit to date. Satellogic has also been recognized for innovative space business solutions with its dedicated satellite constellations and AI-based geospatial analytics services.</p>



<p>These achievements make <a href="https://satsearch.co/suppliers/satellogic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satellogic</a> an excellent example of how ideas and services originating from Argentina and Latin America are capable of revolutionizing how we think about space.</p>

<h2>The future of NewSpace in Latin America</h2>



<p>In August 2020 the <a href="https://iaaspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Academy of Astronautics (IAA)</a> conducted <a href="https://iaaspace.org/event/4th-iaa-latin-american-cubesat-workshop-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 4th IAA Latin American Cubesat Workshop</a> in which, on its last day, it organized a CubeSat Industry session. In this session many Latin American companies, and startups, including Satellogic and EXA, through Cubesat.Market, showcased products and services paving the way for integration of others in the region into NewSpace.</p>



<p>Some of the presenters included the University of Chile, EMSISTI, ISI-SE Senai, Orbital, CRON, Fibraforte, HORUSEYE, and Opto S&amp;D. These companies, ranging from new small startups to large established firms, are creating satellite systems for many different applications, from attitude and determination actuators for CubeSats to <a href="https://blog.satsearch.co/2020-04-03-smallsat-and-cubesat-solar-panels-on-the-global-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solar panels</a>, and fuel and oxidizer tanks for large spacecraft.</p>



<p>This session showed the wide availability of space innovation in the region and inspired the possibility of future collaboration, and larger regional projects.</p>



<p>Latin America may be historically constrained as an underdeveloped region in global terms, but these case studies show that a few private institutions are leading the way, setting an example of what is possible, expanding the state-of-the-art, proposing innovative business models and not just joining the NewSpace era, but also becoming a driving force for how it is going to continue to develop in the future.</p>



<p>These companies hope to show that it is possible for Latin American space companies to achieve such success, all while bringing the financial and social benefits of space for all its people. </p>

            <p>Don’t use Homebrew Python. It’s not meant for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>At some point Homebrew made changes that adversely affect Python development. While Homebrew’s Python formula has been the go-to choice for Python developers (including me) for a long time, that time is past — there are now <em>much</em> better options&nbsp;available.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the&nbsp;Problem?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you heard stories about why you shouldn’t use the system-bundled Python<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" title="I’ve talked about some macOS-specific reasons to eschew its bundled Python, but Ubuntu/Debian is also affected.">1</a></sup>, so instead you use Homebrew to install Python and then use its interpreter to create a virtual environment. A month later, you activate that same environment, and when you try to use it, you see this inscrutable&nbsp;error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>dyld</span><span>:</span> <span>Library</span> <span>not</span> <span>loaded</span><span>:</span> <span>@</span><span>executable_path</span><span>/../</span><span>.</span><span>Python</span>
<span>Referenced</span> <span>from</span><span>:</span> <span>/your/home/.virtualenvs/your-env-name/bin/</span><span>python</span>
<span>Reason</span><span>:</span> <span>image</span> <span>not</span> <span>found</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>What happened? The Python interpreter referenced by the virtual environment… no longer exists. But how can that be? You didn’t change&nbsp;anything!</p>
<p><em>You</em> didn’t change anything… but Homebrew did. Of the adverse changes Homebrew made recently, two stand out as root causes of this&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>First, Homebrew now upgrades dependent packages automatically. So if you upgrade <em>any</em> package that depends on the <code>python</code> formula<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" title="You can see which of your installed formulae depend on the python formula by running: brew uses python --installed … I have over 30 Python-dependent formulae installed on my workstation.">2</a></sup> (and there are nearly <strong>400</strong> of them), then your Python interpreter will be upgraded also — whether you like it or not. You have no control over&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Second, Homebrew now automatically deletes previous versions every 30 days, including of course any Python interpreters you used to create virtual&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p>The havoc wrought by the combination of these two changes is considerable. Those Python virtual environments you created over the last year? All of them are now broken. Why? Just because you ran <code>brew upgrade ponysay</code>? Yup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" title="Previously, you had to manually run brew cleanup to get yourself into this mess. Now the carnage happens automatically. Any time a new Python version is released, even patch releases such as from 3.8.6 to 3.8.7, there is the very real potential that any virtual environment that depends on the previous Python version will just break horribly and without any warning. And it’s not just your virtual environments — any software that depends on Python can have the carpet yanked out from under it, including Pipx, YouCompleteMe, and other components that you may not even realize depend on the presence of a stable Python foundation. Moreover, this problem isn’t even confined to Python. Need a specific version of Node.js to build static assets for your web application? Have an old Rails app that needs a previous Ruby version? Under the Homebrew regime, those can also be swept away at any&nbsp;time.">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="homebrew-python-is-not-for-you">Homebrew Python Is Not For&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>The web is littered with frustrated reports about this problem and replete with hacked-together Bash scripts that purport to repair damaged Python virtual environments. And all because of one core&nbsp;misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Homebrew’s Python is not for you. It exists to serve Homebrew, or more accurately, Homebrew’s other formulae. The primary purpose of Homebrew’s Python formula is to enable other Python-dependent Homebrew packages to work. If installing Homebrew’s Python allows you to run the occasional Python script or access the <abbr title="read-eval-print loop"><span>REPL</span></abbr><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" title="Assuming you’re okay with bundled Python caveats, there’s no reason to install Homebrew just for Python, since macOS includes Python 3 in its command-line tools (CLT) package.">4</a></sup>, that’s a nice side benefit, but anything beyond that — including developing software with Python — is squarely&nbsp;out-of-scope.</p>
<p>Once you come to this realization, it should be clear that this is the wrong tool for the job. So what is the right&nbsp;tool?</p>

<p>There are several solutions that put <strong>you</strong> back in control of when Python versions are installed, upgraded, and removed. Personally, I use <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/danhper/asdf-python">Python plugin</a> to do <a href="https://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/">just that</a>. I prefer <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/">asdf</a> to similar tools such as Pyenv and Pythonz because not only can you install multiple Python versions but also multiple Node.js versions, Ruby versions, and <a href="https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list">many more</a>.</p>
<p>After switching to this solution, would you like to guess how many times I’ve had something break due to a Python upgrade? Right: <em>Zero</em>. Zero times. Because <strong>I</strong> am now in control of when older Python versions are swept away, I can upgrade virtual environments at my leisure, and then, once I’ve confirmed no other environments rely on older versions, I can then uninstall those old Python versions without worrying about something&nbsp;breaking.</p>
<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>There are hack workarounds, and I’ve tried them. None of them fix the core&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>For example, the automatic monthly clean-up can be disabled by defining a <code>HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP</code> environment variable and setting it to “1”. But all it takes is one accidental <code>brew</code> invocation in a shell session where that variable is not set, and your environments are laid to waste. Plus, even if you avoid that footgun, there is no easy way to remove specific old versions that you may no longer need; you have no choice but to <code>rm -rf</code> directories in <code>/usr/local/Cellar/</code> and hope you don’t break&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>I also tried to avoid installing Homebrew Python entirely, with the idea that since I’m not using it anymore, I don’t need it to be installed. But assuming you use Homebrew to install other tools, that would be a fool’s errand — Homebrew Python will almost certainly be installed anyway when some other formula requires it. But that doesn’t mean we have to use it! Let the Homebrewed Python sit there and do its job serving other formulae, and we can forget it&nbsp;exists.</p>

            <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> is my favourite piece of software on the Mac. It's fast. It's reliable. It's unobtrusive.</p>
<p>I've been using it since I started working on macOS in 2013. In this post I would like to show you how I use it, my custom workflows and some tips and tricks. (Note: You find links to used themes and wallpapers at <a href="#themes-and-wallpapers">the end</a> of this article).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/80738e5e7573f3a72bfec04efb7b74500b8526fa/08b15/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred-themes.jpg" alt=""></p><h2>What is Alfred?</h2>
<p>macOS ships with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">Spotlight</a>. A system wide search. In Yosemite, Apple redesigned the UI and Spotlight got a lot smarter. (You can do calculations or webs searches too).</p>
<p>Alfred is Spotlight on steroids. It uses Spotlight's search index to search files on your Mac, can start any of your installed apps and you can extend Alfred with custom workflows. The worfklow features become available when you upgrade and buy the "Powerpack".</p>
<p>With the basic summary out of the way, let's get started by replacing Spotlight with Alfred.</p>
<h2>Use Spotlight Keyboard Shortcut for Alfred</h2>
<p>The first I thing I do, when installing Alfred on a Mac, is disabling the default keyboard shortcut for Spotlight (<code>⌘+Space</code>) and use it for Alfred.</p>
<p>To do that, open <code>System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts</code>. Click on  "Spotlight" and disable "Show Spotlight search".</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Disable the "Show Spotlight search" setting to free up the `⌘+Space` keyboard shortcut</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Open the Alfred settings and use the freed up <code>⌘+Space</code>-combination to launch Alfred.</p>

  <figcaption>Update the keyboard shortcut to invoke Alfred to `⌘+Space`.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Custom Web Searches</h2>
<p>Web searches are the first powerful feature we take a closer look at. I use them everyday at work; but not necessarily to search. Let me explain:</p>
<p>In summary, a custom web search allows you to set up a shortcut to start a search on any website. It just passes the given search term to a URL. For example <code>app Tony Stark</code> expands to <code>https://example.com/search?q=Tony Stark</code>. So far, so good.</p>
<p>The way I use "web searches" in Alfred, is that my input is ususally an ID for a resource in one of my most used applications and not necessarily as a search term. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the customer details page in our app. <code>app:customer 123</code> expands to <code>https://example.com/admin/customers/123/</code>.</li>
<li>Open the invoice details page in our app. <code>app:invoice 123</code> would expand to <code>https://example.com/admin/invoices/123</code>. ("invoice" is a generic example and you can adapt this to any other "thing" you use at your job (posts, sale, product, …))</li>
<li>Open a JIRA ticket. <code>jira PROJ-123</code> expands to <code>https://jira.example.com/browse/PROJ-123</code>.</li>
<li>Quickly open a personal GitHub repository by typing <code>ghm repo_name</code>. The search url looks like this: <code>https://github.com/your-username/{query}</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course I also use it as a regular search too.Here are a few examples I use regularly. (Click "Import" to import the custom web search)</p>
<ul>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developers.mozilla.org/">MDN Web Docs</a>. <code>mdn querySelectorAll</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20MDN%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/mdn/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fsearch%3Fq%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com</a>. <code>can flexbox</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Can%20I%20Use%20X%20in%20browser%20Y/can/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fcaniuse.com%2F%23search%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
<li>Search <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://caniemail.com/">caniemail.com</a>. <code>canemail grid</code>. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20caniemail.com%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/canemail/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.caniemail.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fs%3D%7Bquery%7D">Import</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also have custom searches for different ecommerce sites I regularly visit. I can type <code>groceries Toiletpaper</code> and land on the search page of the desired online shop.</p>
<p>But I think you get the gist: The sky is the limit!<br>
If you regularly go to a website and search for something or need to look up a "details page", consider creating a custom web search for it.</p>
<h2>Clipboard History</h2>
<p>Copy and pasting is something I do everyday. Be it code, files, URLs, IDs or just text. Alfred ships with a clipboard manager, which allows you to paste previously copied text into your editor or email draft.</p>
<p>The best thing about it? It also supports images and file lists! What does this mean?
Instead of just keeping track of copied text, Alfred also stores copied files and images in a buffer. You can then browse this buffer and paste text and images in any order you like.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/34c453b619069d7ad30a7dd46befb07b0acafe4a/0aa63/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_history_compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>This video shows, how I can copy multiple items into the clipboard history and retrieve them in different orders.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I've remapped the shortcut to open the Clipboard History to <code>⇧+⌘+C</code>. It's a bit more logical to me.</p>
<p>The clipboard history is something that takes some time to get used to. The first few days or weeks you forget, that it exists. But once you've understood it, are compfortable with it and know that it's available to you in every app, you don't wan't to miss it.</p>
<h2>Snippets</h2>
<p>Yet another powerful tool hidden behind "Features" in Alfreds settings are Snippets. As the name might suggest, in snippets you can store often used text snippets. Be it canned email responses, fake credit card numbers to test your Stripe integration, Emojis or Mac Symols like <code>⌘</code> or <code>⌅</code>.</p>
<p>I've updated the keyword to open the snippet search to be￼ <code>s</code>. To paste the character <code>→</code> into a document for example, I then only have to type <code>s right</code>, select the right snippet and hit enter.</p>
<h3>Markdown Fences</h3>
<p>My most used snippets do not paste readable text into the currently focused editor, but rather a set of characters. Backticks or "Markdown fences" to be exact.</p>
<p>For 20 years now, I've used keyboards with the Swiss-German layout. To denote a word or phrase as code in Markdown, you have to enclose it in backticks (`). On the Swiss-German keyboard layout you have to hit a weird combination which gets quite annoying if you have to type it a hundred times a day. I also quickly fall out of my writing flow.<br>
So I've written 2 snippets to fix that.</p>
<p>First there is the "inline Markdown code" snippet, invoked by typing <code>imdc</code>. As the name suggests it's for highlighting code inline in a sentence (Like you've seen it scattered in the article you're reading right know).
For multi-line code examples I've created a "Markdown code" snippet, invoked by typing <code>mdc</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/76011772d3b86b476840af5301be7c2ccb89f1b5/a2e5d/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_markdown.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>By using a snippet to create Markdown code fences, I can easly type my code examples without breaking my writing flow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The best thing is, that you can use the <code>{cursor}</code> variable to automatially move the cursor between the two backticks.</p>
<p>Here's is the content of those two Markdown snippets:</p>
<pre><code># Inline Markdown Code
`{$cursor}`
</code></pre>
<pre><code># Markdown Code
```
{$cursor}
```
</code></pre>
<h3>Emojis</h3>
<p>My biggest snippet collection is centered around emojis. Wether you love them or hate them, sometimes you use them.</p>
<p>Joel Califa once created an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/">"Emoji Snippet Pack"</a>. This collection of snippets allows you to type <code>:v:</code> to get the ✌️ emoji.
Since Joel released his pack, new emojis have been released, and I stepped up and created a build process to his open-sourced emoji pack (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/califa/alfred-emoji-pack/pull/1">see PR #1</a>).<br>
However, my added build process relies on dependencies which very slowly update to newly released emojis (which is okay, as these dependencies are used for something different than a snippet pack).</p>
<p>That's why I've created my own project. You can find it <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/alfred-emoji-pack">on GitHub</a>.<br>
Currently it's the same as the one from Joel, but written in PHP. The goal is, to switch the source for the emojis to the official list of available characters from unicode.org.<br>
A plus would then be to also create a new release when new emojis are being released by using GitHub Actions.
I will work on that project over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Here's a quick video on how I use the emoji snippets.</p>
<figure>
    <video loading="lazy" controls="" loop="" muted="">
        <source src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b5f4c753aa822532c8192cd048d5e90770761269/459cd/assets/images/posts/20210130-my-alfred-setup/alfred_emoji.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>By having all emojis available as snippets, I can type them out or search them in my snippets library. No need to scroll though Apple's emoji picker.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Miscellaneous Snippets</h3>
<p>I also have snippets which actually contain text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canned responses to support emails or unsolicited recruiter emails,</li>
<li>Templates for certain types of notes I take</li>
<li>Code snippets I regularly use</li>
<li>Shortcuts for CLI actions (like ziping a folder on UNIX as I will never remember the options for <code>tar</code> 😅)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Workflows</h2>
<p>Next let's cover the most famous and powerful feature of Alfred: Workflows.</p>
<p>Workflows allow you to write basic programs with a drag and drop editor. You define the event that triggers the workflow (a hotkey, a snippet, a file action), define its input (keyword, file filter) and then take action it (open a file, run a search or run a script).</p>
<p>They can wary between very simple and very complex. For example "search <em>this</em> folder for <em>that</em> file type and open the file in <em>that</em> app" is quite easy to accomplish. "Search and play Spotify playlists" however is quite complex and needs a lot of scripting work.</p>
<p>So first I would like to show you some of my own workflows. They are quite simple but save me a couple of seconds every day.</p>
<h3>Open Common Folders</h3>
<p>Eventhough Alfred comes with a backed in file browser, I often still use good old Finder.app. To get access to my most used folders quickly, I've created workflows which just open that folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>downloads</code> opens <code>~/Downloads</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>desktop</code> opens <code>~/Desktop</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>sites</code> opens <code>~/Sites</code> (where all my code projects live)</li>
<li>
<code>inbox</code> opens my <a href="https://stefanzweifel.io/posts/2020/08/04/synology-nas-setup-2020/#folder-structure--synology-drive">File Inbox</a>
</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption>The "Common Folders" workflow is simple but effective for navigating to most used folders quickly.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Workflows like these might look silly at first. But once you realize how much time you spend browsing Finder – by mouse or keyboard – you might change your mind.</p>
<h3>File Filter Workflows</h3>
<p>Not used that much anymore but still handy, is my collection of file filters. I've created several workflows to search for files with a certain extension or just folders in a directory and pass that file to an application.</p>

</figure>
<p>For example, I can type <code>phps laravel-stats</code> to open <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/stefanzweifel/laravel-stats">laravel-stats</a> in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>.</p>
<p>Or I can type <code>unzip backup</code> and Alfred will search for <code>.zip</code> files which have "backup" in their name. Selecting the zip file will open it in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?l=en&amp;mt=12">The Unarchiver</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a quick tutorial on how to set this up yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new blank workflow</li>
<li>Add a new "File Filter" input</li>
<li>Set a keyword, title and subtext that matches what you want to do.</li>
<li>Drag the file types you want to search for into the "File Types" box. For example, if you want to search for Markdown files, drag a <code>.md</code>-file into it.</li>
<li>Then create and connect a "Open File" Action with your File Filter.</li>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There’s an old saying that we can learn a lot about people by looking at their trash. The same can hold true about programming languages. More precisely, we can learn a lot about a programming language by looking at its garbage collection. This post kicks off a series of posts (and eventually a book) about Ruby’s GC.</p>

<p>Continuing with the (admitedly not great) metaphor here, we’ll start by looking at what is always in Ruby’s trash. Ruby exposes <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/GC.html"><code>GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</code></a>, so we can see what is <em>constant</em> within the garbage collector.</p>

<h3 id="gcinternal_constants">GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</h3>

<p>Printing out <code>GC::INTERNAL_CONSTANTS</code> in Ruby 3.0, we see the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>:DEBUG</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>false</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:RVALUE_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>40</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>409</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>56</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>4</span><span>,</span>
  <span>:HEAP_PAGE_SIZE</span><span>=&gt;</span><span>16384</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll go one by one through these constants, and in defining them, learn much more about how Ruby organizes its memory.</p>

<h4 id="debug--false">:DEBUG =&gt; FALSE</h4>

<p>This <code>:DEBUG</code> constant is really more useful for debugging writing Ruby source code than writing Ruby programs. Almost every Ruby program we run will have <code>:DEBUG =&gt; FALSE</code> so we don’t have to worry about it!</p>

<p>For the extremely curious, the only way <code>:DEBUG</code> is <code>TRUE</code> is if we compile Ruby source code with a cppflag setting <code>DGC_DEBUG</code> to true (see <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/66a844fd07ca0fd652a20a1973ea242422d4ae6d/.github/workflows/compilers.yml#L110">this example</a>). But, since most of the time we’re not compiling Ruby source code, it’ll almost always be <code>FALSE</code>.</p>

<h4 id="rvalue_size--40">:RVALUE_SIZE =&gt; 40</h4>

<p>It’s important to first note that the units for all of these constants which end in <code>_SIZE</code> are bytes. So this constant is telling us that each <code>RVALUE</code> is 40 bytes.</p>

<p>Neat. But, it begs the question, what is an <code>RVALUE</code>? An <code>RVALUE</code> contains basic information about Ruby objects. <code>RVALUES</code> are C structs which are unions of various C representations of Ruby objects.</p>

<p>As part of this information, they either contain the actual values of Ruby objects, or, if the values are too large for the 40 byte limit, they contain pointers to where on the OS heap the Ruby object’s value lives.</p>

<p>(Small aside, strings with 23 characters or fewer have thier values stored inside <code>RVALUES</code>, while strings with more than 23 characters have their values stored on the OS Heap. Pat Shaughnessy has <a href="http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/1/4/never-create-ruby-strings-longer-than-23-characters">a fun blog post</a> explaining this nuance.)</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_obj_limit--409">:HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT =&gt; 409</h4>

<p>Okay, next up, <code>HEAP_PAGE_OBJ_LIMIT</code>. 409 is the maximum number of objects per each <code>HEAP_PAGE</code>. But what is a <code>HEAP</code> and what is a <code>PAGE</code>?</p>

<p>The Ruby <code>HEAP</code> is Ruby’s entire Object Space, or memory. It is where all of our <code>RVALUES</code> live. The <code>HEAP</code> is segmented into <code>PAGES</code>. When the garbage collector needs more memory, it doesn’t request new memory for each individual object from the OS. As we learned above with the <code>RVALUE_SIZE</code>, this would mean requesting more memory in 40 byte segments, which would be wildly inefficient.</p>

<p>Instead, when the <code>HEAP</code> needs more memory, it requests an entire new <code>PAGE</code>. These pages each contain up to 409 objects. Some pages contain slightly fewer than 409 objects; Aaron Patterson has <a href="https://tenderlovemaking.com/2017/09/27/visualizing-your-ruby-heap.html">a great blog post</a> which explains why. But, as this constant tells us, 409 is the upper limit of objects (or <code>RVALUE</code>s) per page.</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_bitmap_size--56">:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_SIZE =&gt; 56</h4>

<p>We now know <code>HEAP</code> and <code>PAGE</code>, but what is the <code>BITMAP</code>? Well, each <code>HEAP_PAGE</code> also has a representation of its objects in a bitmap. Each object is represented by one bit.</p>

<p>Okay, so this bitmap takes up 56 bytes of memory. The math here checks out. There are 8 bits in a byte. Which means with our 56 bytes we have access to <code>56 * 8 == 448</code> objects which will safely cover all of the 409 objects we want to represent.</p>

<p>But, I still haven’t answered the question of why we need these bitmaps to represent all of the objects in the first place. This is <em>integral</em> to the actual algorithm Ruby uses for garbage collection. It’s a tri-color mark and sweep algorithm. The details of this algorithm deserve at least one of their own entire blog posts. (When I’ve written that, I’ll link it here.) For now, you’re just going to have to trust that it’s important this bitmap exists per page, and has enough space for each object within a page.</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_bitmap_planes--4">:HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES =&gt; 4</h4>

<p>I must admit, this one stumped me. So I <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/search?q=HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES">searched the Ruby source code</a>, found where it is set to 4, but absolutely no use of the variable itself. As far as I can tell, this value is unused. I then, admitedly, dove deep into a nostalgic-for-travel googling of airplanes.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the matter at hand, if anyone knows what <code>HEAP_PAGE_BITMAP_PLANES</code> means, please, please let me know, I am super curious to learn! I have a hunch that it is remnants from an older Ruby version….</p>

<h4 id="heap_page_size--16384">:HEAP_PAGE_SIZE =&gt; 16384</h4>

<p>Lastly, we have the size of the pages themselves. 16384 bytes means each page is a little over 16KB. These pages have headers with some information, and then all of their <code>RVALUES</code>. The spaces where the <code>RVALUES</code> are stored are called slots. So above, when we said the <code>HEAP_PAGE_OBJECT_LIMIT</code> was 409, another way to frame this would have been that each page has a maximum of 409 slots.</p>

<p>Again, we can check the math here. There should be enough space within each page for all of its <code>RVALUES</code>, and a little extra for the header information. We know each page has a maximum of 409 <code>RVALUES</code>, and each <code>RVALUE</code> is 40 bytes. So <code>409 * 40 == 16,306 &lt; 16384</code>.</p>

<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>For any visual learners, here’s a diagram explaining the above:</p>

<p><img src="https://jemma.dev/assets/heap-diagram.png" alt="Heap diagram"></p>

<p>And here’s a quick definition-based summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Heap</strong> (Variable size): Ruby’s Object Space, or memory. Where Ruby stores all of its Pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Page</strong> (~16 KB): How Ruby segments its Heap. Heaps contain pages. Pages contain at most 409 slots.</li>
  <li><strong>Slot</strong> (40 bytes): A space on a Page where an RVALUE is stored</li>
  <li><strong>RVALUE</strong> (40 bytes): Ruby’s C representation of objects. Sometimes contains the value of the object, sometimes contains a pointer to where the object lives in the OS heap</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s all for this post! As I referenced earlier, I will be writing much more about garbage collection (both blog posts and a book!!). If you’re interested in following along and hearing when I have new posts, please leave your email address below.</p>

a description of some property of your system from a description of the domain
over which that property must hold. For example, if you're testing the
'addition' operation, you might what to check the <em>property</em> that it's
commutative (the output is the same, regardless of the order). The relevant
<em>domain</em> here is pairs of numbers.</p> <p><span>For the mathematically inclined, you can think of the property as being a proposition with some number of free variables, and the domains as binding each free variable with a universal quantifier.

you're new to this, I recommend trying to write at least one proptest, then
reading the advice below.</p> <p>This is not going to be a basic 'How to proptest' tutorial. There are many, many
treatments of that subject; you should probably start with the documentation for
your language's proptest library. A few of my favorites are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/AltSysrq/proptest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proptest (Rust)</a> (We use this extensively at Auxon)</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/test.check" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test.check (Clojure)</a></li> <li><a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypothesis (Python)</a></li></ul> <p>Property-based testing libraries are extensively available. There's probably one
you can use in your language of choice.</p> <h3 id="why-proptest"><a href="#why-proptest">#</a> Why Proptest?</h3> <p>Testing and specification can be thought of as a spectrum of rigor. On the
least-rigorous end, we have manual testing and regular written specifications.
Moving up, we find automated unit / integration test and executable
specification languages (like Cucumber, another popular tool at Auxon). Then
there's a massive gulf, and everything gets starts getting academic and
difficult; symbolic execution, model checking, and formal proofs show up at the far end.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.auxon.io/images/posts/effective-property-based-testing-1.png" alt="property-based"></p> <p>Proptests are somewhere in the middle, just a little past the tests you're
already doing. They're a very practical way of verifying your implementation
against a rigorous, executable specification. But they're not much harder to
write than the unit tests you're already doing.</p> <h3 id="terminology-check"><a href="#terminology-check">#</a> Terminology Check</h3> <p>Different proptest libraries use different words to talk about the same thing.
In this article, I'll use 'Generator' to talk about the thing that defines the
input domain for your proptest. (Some people refer to proptests as generative
testing). This is also known as a 'Strategy' in Rust proptest / Python
hypothesis parlance.</p> <p>Code examples will be written in Rust, but the concepts and recommendations
apply to any proptest framework.</p> <h2 id="write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite"><a href="#write-em-compose-em-put-em-in-a-suite">#</a> Write 'em, Compose 'em, Put 'em in a Suite</h2> <h3 id="item-1-develop-a-generator-library"><a href="#item-1-develop-a-generator-library">#</a> Item 1: Develop a Generator Library</h3> <p>Your program probably has a bunch of classes or data structures that it cares
about deeply, that are central to its operation and passed all around the
system. You should identify theses data structures and write generators for
them. You can do this incrementally, as you begin to work with proptests.</p> <h3 id="item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators"><a href="#item-2-be-a-little-suspicious-of-type-based-generators">#</a> Item 2: Be a little suspicious of type-based generators</h3> <p>Many proptest frameworks provide a way to make a generator directly from a
structure, type, or schema definition. These are of course very convenient, and
I've used them often. But they're not as clearly good as you might think.</p> <p>First, your types may not be as precise as what you need for your generators.
Maybe you have a single type which can have two distinct data variants (maybe
both valid and invalid requests?) which you want to generate separately. Second,
event if your type definition is fully precise, you may find that practical
execution considerations require you to make size or other input domain
restrictions in the generators. This happens fairly frequently.</p> <p>For these reasons, I recommend staying away for type-based generators for all
but the most simple applications. We've found that's it's best to just start
with standalone generators; it costs a little more up front, but I always end up
converting to them later on anyways. Clojure's <code>core.spec</code>-based generators are
an exception here, as they provide an ad-hoc way to override portions of the
generated generator. But even then, it's a fairly laborious process.</p> <h3 id="item-3-touch-test-your-generators"><a href="#item-3-touch-test-your-generators">#</a> Item 3: Touch-test your generators</h3> <p>When you're writing your generators, use your language's interactive execution
facilities to try them out. It's common to find unexpected variations in
proptest-generated data, and this can help you shortcut the "WHY did my tests
fail?" process. I've had a lot of success using this technique in Clojure.</p> <h3 id="item-4-learn-your-combinators"><a href="#item-4-learn-your-combinators">#</a> Item 4: Learn your Combinators</h3> <p>Proptest libraries are built from small generators that can be combined to form
more complex structures. Some of these are language/environment dependent, but
the important ones are common:</p> <ul><li><p>Primitive types - You'll start with generators for all the primitives in your
language: integers, floats, strings, etc.</p></li> <li><p>Collection types - Look for direct support for native collections in your
framework; you can use these to generate a collection of anything else you can
generate. Note that collection size can be bounded; you'll find this necessary
when developing larger compound generators.</p></li> <li><p><code>just</code> / <code>return</code> - Proptest frameworks always have a way to 'lift' a single
value, creating a generator that just spits out that value every time.</p></li> <li><p><code>map</code> - Transform a generated value in some way. You might use this to
generate numbers that have been converted to strings.</p></li> <li><p><code>filter</code> - Throw out generated values if they don't pass some test. This is
convenient but a little dangerous; see <a href="#filtering">below</a>.</p></li> <li><p><code>tuple</code> - Get data from multiple generators together. (This is kind of like
'and')</p></li> <li><p><code>one of</code> / <code>choose</code> - Get data from one of the given generators. (This is kind
of like 'or')</p></li> <li><p>data structures - Different frameworks approach this differently, but most
provide some amount of sugar to help you generate native data structures.
Lacking that, one effective strategy is to start with a <code>tuple</code> generator with
one item for each field in your data structure, then use <code>map</code> generator to
put them all together.</p></li> <li><p>recursive structures - If you want to generate a tree or some other kind of
recursive data structure, look for direct support for that in your framework.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering"><a href="#item-5-prefer-constructive-generation-to-filtering">#</a> Item 5: Prefer Constructive Generation to Filtering</h3> <p>The <code>filter</code> combinator is really easy, and one of the first things people
reach for when writing proptests for the first time. The trouble with this
is that it's inefficient, and it can break down entirely when used broadly.</p> <p>Suppose you wanted to make a generator for even numbers. It's easy to do with <code>filter</code>:</p> <p>This works, but it's doing a lost of wasted work: half of all the numbers
generated by the first step will be thrown out. Suppose you did the same thing
to generate multiples of 10: you'll be throwing away 90% of your work. Powers of
two? That's way out of hand. Most proptest frameworks will abort execution if
they aren't able to generate a valid sample after some number of tries.</p> <p>This is not only a problem with single value generators: you'll find that as you
start to combine generators to produce more complex structures, the effects of
multiple filter-based generators will accumulate, and you'll be aborting
execution all the time.</p> <p>The solution to this is to instead build your generators constructively. Start
with a fully specified domain, then transform that to get what you want. This
can be tricky, and sometimes requires oblique thinking to get it right. In the
case of our even numbers, it's not too bad:</p> <p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule; there are plenty of times where <code>filter</code> is
the only choice. But you should beware of your <code>filter</code>'s selectivity, and be
careful of using it too much.</p> <h3 id="item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies"><a href="#item-6-use-flatmap-bind-for-data-dependencies">#</a> Item 6: Use flatmap/bind for Data Dependencies</h3> <p>Many data structures have some kind of internal consistency requirement. For
example, you might have a record that contains a vector of strings, and an index
into that list representing a cursor. We'd like to only generate valid cursors.
(Sometimes you want to generate <em>invalid</em> cursors as well, of course)</p> <p>The naive way to do this might be to start with a <code>tuple</code> of the vector
generator and a cursor generator, and then use <code>filter</code> to remove all tuples
where the cursor is out of bounds:</p> <p>This is a correct and succinct way to specify the constraint, but you'll find
that your proptest framework probably gives up after generating too many
candidates that don't match. It's radically inefficient at best.</p> <p>The constructive way to do this is to start with a generator for the list of
strings, and then use <code>flatmap</code> (or <code>bind</code>, the names vary) to generate an
in-bounds index:</p> <h3 id="item-7-bound-your-collections"><a href="#item-7-bound-your-collections">#</a> Item 7: Bound your collections</h3> <p>When you're making generators for collection-typed values (Vectors, Lists,
Maps, etc), it's tempting to say "do this for ALL the possible collections!" In
terms of specification, that's correct. But in terms of execution, it can get
out of hand. Does your system <em>really</em> need to be able to handle 200 million
distinct zip codes?</p> <p>This can get especially bad if you have compound data structures with collections nested under other collections. Even if your implementation can gracefully handle the load, you may find that your proptest framework cannot.</p> <p>You should carefully consider what you actually care about verifying,
and target that. I often choose a 'reasonable' (which depends on the context)
limit to the size of straight collections of simple values. When dealing with
nested collections, the "zero, one, many" rule of thumb applies; <code>many == 2 or 3</code> typically works well.</p> <h2 id="look-it-s-a-propiphaunt"><a href="#look-it-s-a-propiphaunt">#</a> Look! It's a Propiphaunt!</h2> <h3 id="item-8-start-small"><a href="#item-8-start-small">#</a> Item 8: Start small</h3> <p>When you're bringing proptest into a code base for the first time, it's tempting
to Specify All The Things. This is unfortunately a good way to fail. If you jump
into the deep end, you'll find that your proptests are mysteriously failing or
hanging in ways you can't explain. It's important to go at this incrementally as
you develop a feel for what kinds of generators your system needs, and what
kinds of properties you can feasibly verify.</p> <p>Start by proptesting your pure …</p></div></div>

          <section>
            <p>During this global pandemic, online video calls have become essential to the way we work. Millions of workers are now accustomed to hopping on calls with their colleagues to hash things out that they would previously have done in person. Zoom has shown itself to be a reliable partner for video conferencing. However, as a company, Zoom has given <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">plenty of</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">reasons to</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279355/zoom-end-encryption-calls-fbi-police-free-users">avoid</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/12/876351501/zoom-acknowledges-it-suspended-activists-accounts-at-china-s-request">its software.</a></p>

<p>The world’s new reliance on video conferencing got me thinking: <em>How hard could it be to build a video conferencing web application?</em> Like most things worth doing, the answer was <em>difficult, but fun</em>.</p>

<p>When I first started researching for this project, I discovered that there isn’t much information out there about building a WebRTC-based application from start to finish. Mozilla’s WebRTC documentation is invaluable, but it lacked answers to some of the questions I had. And tutorials that exist generally only cover connecting two users in a fairly basic way. I wanted to do something more ambitious.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-going-to-build">What we’re going to build:</h2>

<p>In this article, we’re going to build a real-time video chat application with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app will allow users to create video chat rooms with a unique slug, allowing any user to join.</li>
  <li>The app will keep track of which users are connected to the given room.</li>
  <li>The app will allow users to establish a group video call with eachother through WebRTC peer connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, that sounds easy enough. Creating pages with central information on the fly in a web app is the bread and butter of any self-respecting web framework—and with Phoenix it’s a piece of cake. Tracking users seems a little tricky, but if you’ve heard of what LiveView and PubSub can do, you can probably guess that we’re still on the right track. WebRTC was designed for video calls, but group video calls? That might get complex. Plus, how would that even work if each of the connections is only peer-to-peer? We’ll get to that.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://littlechat.app/">We’ve wrapped up the finished product and deployed it at littlechat.app</a>. Try creating a room and hopping on it with a friend or two. That’s what we’re going to create.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/littlelines/littlechat">You can also find the source code for this project here if you’re more of the self-guided type.</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>I’m going to assume that you are comfortable working with Elixir and Phoenix. I’ll assume that you might have toyed around with LiveView a few times before this article, but it doesn’t take much to get up to speed. Finally, I’ll assume you have no WebRTC experience beyond having heard about it a few times.</p>

<p>We will be using the latest versions of Elixir, Erlang, Phoenix, and Phoenix LiveView in this article, which are the following at the time of writing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir 1.10.3</li>
  <li>Erlang 23.0.2</li>
  <li>Phoenix 1.5.3</li>
  <li>Phoenix LiveView 0.13.3</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tech">The Tech</h2>

<h3 id="webrtc">WebRTC</h3>

<p>Web Real Time Communication, or WebRTC for short, is a technology that allows real-time, peer-to-peer communication between users. It provides an API for handling user video, audio, and other data via peer-to-peer connections.</p>

<p>WebRTC has been around since 2011, but implementation by the various browsers has been uneven over the years. Nowadays, each browser has a more consistent WebRTC implementation, making browser support much better, but implementing it can still be a dance.</p>

<p>What makes WebRTC so flexible—and, at times, confounding—is that it has no standardized server-side implementation. WebRTC does not care how users in a video chat learn about each other and send their connection information, it only handles how to connect those users once their information has been sent. This originally confused me, as I was not sure where the server-side <em>signaling</em> (the WebRTC term for the process of telling two users about each other for a peer connection) ended and the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> began. We’ll dig into this later.</p>

<h3 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h3>

<p>Elixir’s Phoenix framework allows us to build reliable and performant web applications built on Erlang’s rock-solid foundation. On any project, my first instinct these days is to reach for Phoenix. But the motivation goes deeper.</p>

<p>Elixir is built on Erlang’s VM, which was specifically developed for the challenges of the telecoms industry, where fault-tolerance and high-availability are essential. That sounds perfect for this project.</p>

<h3 id="liveview">LiveView</h3>

<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> is one of my favorite components of Phoenix. It makes real-time user interaction between the client’s UI and the server seamless, without needing to write (much) JavaScript. LiveView makes real-time user interactions much easier to build and maintain, all while working within familiar concepts: Phoenix, Elixir, and OTP.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Have you got all your tools ready? Let’s go!</p>

<p>First, we’re going to create a new Phoenix project with LiveView already configured. If you’re trying to add video chat to an existing app without LiveView already configured, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/installation.html#content">LiveView is pretty easy to set up from scratch too.</a> We’re going to call our project Littlechat, a portmenteau of Littlelines and chat.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.new littlechat --live</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let’s <code>cd littlechat</code> into our brand new app and install its dependencies.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd </span>littlechat
<span>$ </span>mix deps.get
<span>$ </span>npm install --prefix assets</code></pre></div>

<p>Standard stuff. Let’s go a little deeper.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-rooms">Creating the Rooms</h2>

<p>Users can’t connect to each other if they don’t have a place to meet, so let’s build them a room!</p>

<p>Let’s create a <em>context</em> called <code>Organizer</code> with a schema <code>Room</code>.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>mix phx.gen.context Organizer Room rooms title:string slug:string</code></pre></div>

<p>That generated a few files for us, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</code>, <code>lib/littlechat/organizer/room.ex</code>, and a migration file ending in <code>XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</code> Let’s start with our Room schema.</p>

<p>Our rooms will only have two data to start, <code>slug</code> and <code>title</code>, both strings. <code>slug</code> will be the unique identifier for the room, so we’ll need to add a unique index to the database to prevent collisions. Let’s set up the database:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># priv/repo/migrations/XXXXX_create_rooms.exs</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Repo.Migrations.CreateRooms</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto.Migration</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>change</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>create</span> <span>table</span><span>(</span><span>"rooms"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:slug</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:title</span><span>,</span> <span>:string</span>

      <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>create</span> <span>unique_index</span><span>(</span><span>:rooms</span><span>,</span> <span>:slug</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For the schema, we’re going to create a basic changeset function with the added <code>unique_constraint</code> on slug. But we’re also going to add a private function, <code>format_slug/1</code> for the purpose of cleaning our slug input.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/room.ex</span>

<p>Great! Now we can create rooms in the database. What about getting one from the DB? Easy.</p>

<div><pre><code><span># lib/littlechat/organizer.ex</span>

<span>defmodule</span> <span>Littlechat.Organizer</span> <span>do</span>

<p>Now let’s build LiveViews for creating and viewing rooms.</p>

<p>We’re going to create two LiveViews, <code>LittlechatWeb.Room.NewLive</code> and <code>LittlechatWeb.Room.ShowLive</code>, the former for creating and the latter for showing the rooms. Let’s start with <code>NewLive</code>:</p>

  <li>Inside of this template, we create a basic form for creating a new Room. Note the reference to the <code>@changeset</code> assign.</li>
  <li>We then tell the form (via LiveView) to send the event <code>"validate"</code> to the server every time user input is added.</li>
  <li>Finally, we tell the form to send the event <code>"submit"</code>, along with the associated form data, to the server when the user makes a submit action (presses enter or clicks “Submit”).</li>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-huawei-telecoms-plan/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									
<p>The German government is preparing a massive investment plan to boost the development of local telecoms firms, in an effort to pivot away from dominant suppliers like China's Huawei.</p>



<p>The plan, dubbed the "joint proposal for action" by the ministries of interior, economy, research and transport, and seen by POLITICO, lays out how the government plans to spend €2 billion in funding from its larger coronavirus recovery stimulus program <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/news/konjunkturpaket-1757640" target="_blank">presented in June</a>.</p>



<p>"The prosperity and competitiveness of Germany and Europe will increasingly depend on mastering new communication technologies," the proposal said, adding that this would "require a common political and industrial commitment at national and European level." </p>



<p>The plan comes as European governments increasingly take steps to box out Chinese tech giant Huawei from 5G-rollout plans due to security concerns. The restrictions mean telecoms operators have become more reliant on Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia, triggering calls from telecoms <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1578702">operators</a> and some lawmakers to open up the supply chain to new players.</p>



<p>The German draft proposal includes over €300 million of investment in Open RAN technology, €237 million for a 6G research hub and €250 million to boost demand and expand 5G networks.</p>



<p>The draft also earmarked €550 million of German public investment in Europe's microchip market through a joint project, <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">announced Tuesday</a>, between the government, the EU and local industry players.</p>



<p>The draft proposal was <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/open-ran-geheimpapier-milliarden-fuer-neue-mobilfunktechnik-sollen-abhaengigkeit-von-huawei-verringern/26830274.html?ticket=ST-5932468-7f1AIvazemqcyVbktwbi-ap6" target="_blank">first reported by Handelsblatt</a>.</p>



<h3>Looking for new 5G</h3>



<p>The government wants to prioritize "open RAN" technologies throughout its telecoms investment plan, a concept that would chop up the 5G supply chain into smaller pieces and break the market power of large end-to-end vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia.</p>



<p>Ericsson and Nokia "for long have held a globally good position," the text said, but "China is however technological frontrunner in 5G mobile networks." </p>



<p>"Germany and Europe need to urgently strengthen their competences and develop industrial ecosystems for Open RAN and 6G technologies, including hardware and software," it said.</p>



<p>The adoption of Open RAN could mean a blow for Ericsson and Nokia, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1431389">have benefited</a> from the pushback against Huawei. But <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/oran-reflow-huawei-europe-telecoms-5g/">the concept is heavily favored by telecoms operators</a>, who use the equipment and complain that they are too reliant on gear from the two European suppliers.</p>



<p>The plan seeks to facilitate "Germany's entry into technologies for Open RAN solutions," with hopes to establish new companies in niche markets like network integration and edge computing software.</p>



<p>These services and products are currently part of major contracts between operators and major vendors like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia. </p>



<p>Experts have warned that the Open RAN technology is still immature and it could take years for these new types of networks to function as well as conventional 5G systems.</p>



<p>But the concept has gained influence in countries including the U.S. and the U.K., where lawmakers sought ways to replace Huawei.</p>



<p>In the European Union, Germany so far has been among the most eager to promote the concept — which is also heavily favored by its telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom as it looks to exit its <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/deutsche-telekom-huawei-us-security-measures/">dependency on Huawei equipment</a>.</p>



<h3>Microchip plan</h3>



<p>Also on Tuesday, the German government said it wants to boost the German and European semiconductor industry with new EU, German and private investments to boost chip manufacturing and design firms.</p>



<p>“We want Germany and Europe to become more sovereign and independent of imports when it comes to microelectronics and communication technologies," Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement, announcing the <a href="https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2021/02/20210202-gemeinsames-europaeisches-grossprojekt-zu-mikroelektronik-und-kommunikationstechnologien-geht-in-die-startbloecke.html" target="_blank">government's plan</a> to launch a so-called Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI), elected projects that are set up to allow EU and national public funding to help private companies develop new technologies like microchips.. </p>



<p>The global semiconductor supply chain is dominated by U.S., Taiwanese, Chinese and Korean firms. Europe lags far behind in the supply of high-end chips, though it has a handful of companies that champion supply-chain niches like chip-printing machines and chips for cars.</p>



<p>The German call to launch an IPCEI project comes in the wake of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/computer-chip-shortage-disrupts-global-car-production/a-56224486" target="_blank">warnings by its car industry</a> last month that a chip shortage was disrupting its production.</p>



<p>The European Commission is also working on a strategy to catch up on chips. It <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1572339">launched discussions</a> with Europe’s leading firms in a bid to launch an “alliance” of firms, institutes and national governments to pool investments and set up joint projects this spring, including a manufacturing plant for high-end chips.</p>



<p><em>This article was updated to reflect that Important Projects of Common European Interest are approved under EU state aid rules.</em></p>

<![CDATA[Constant Folding in Python]]>
            </title>

February 3, 2021 | https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/constant-folding-python">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Every programming language aims to be performant in its niche and achieving superior performance requires a lot of compiler level optimizations. One famous optimization technique is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a> where during compile time the engine tries to recognize constant expressions, evaluate them, and replaces the expression with this newly evaluated value, making the runtime leaner.</p>
<p>In this essay, we dive deep and find what exactly is Constant Folding, understand the scope of it in the world of Python and finally go through Python's source code - <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/">CPython</a> - and find out how elegantly Python actually implements it.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">Constant Folding</a>, the engine finds and evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than computing them at runtime, making the runtime leaner and faster.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>24</span> * <span>60</span> * <span>60</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When the compiler encounters a constant expression, like above, it evaluates the expression and replaces it with the evaluated value. The expression is usually replaced by the evaluated value in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a>, but the implementation is totally up to the language. Hence the above expression is effectively executed as</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>day_sec = <span>86400</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, we could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#module-dis">Disassembler module</a> to get the CPython bytecode giving us a good peek at how things will be executed. When we disassemble the above constant expression using the <code>dis</code> module, we get the following bytecode</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> dis
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>dis.dis(<span>"day_sec = 24 * 60 * 60"</span>)

        <span>0</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>0</span> (<span>86400</span>)
        <span>2</span> STORE_NAME               <span>0</span> (day_sec)
        <span>4</span> LOAD_CONST               <span>1</span> (<span>None</span>)
        <span>6</span> RETURN_VALUE
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the bytecode, instead of having two binary multiply operations followed by one <code>LOAD_CONST</code>, is having just one <code>LOAD_CONST</code> with the already evaluated value of <code>86400</code>. This indicates that the CPython interpreter during parsing and building of Abstract Syntax Tree folded the constant expression, <code>24 * 60 * 60</code> and replaced it with the evaluated value <code>86400</code>.</p>
<h3>Scope of Constant Folding</h3>
<p>Python tries to fold every single constant expression present but there are some cases where even though the expression is constant, but Python chooses not to fold it. For example, Python does not fold <code>x = 4 ** 64</code> while it does fold <code>x = 2 ** 64</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the arithmetic expressions, Python also folds expressions involving Strings and Tuples, where constant string expressions till the length <code>4096</code> are folded.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4096</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"-"</span> * <span>4097</span>   
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = <span>"--"</span> * <span>4096</span>  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we shift our focus to the internals and find exactly where and how CPython implements Constant Folding. All AST optimizations, including Constant Folding, can be found in file <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/ast_opt.c">ast_opt.c</a>. The base function starting it all is <code>astfold_expr</code> which folds any and every expression that Python source has. The function recursively goes through the AST and tries to fold every constant expression, as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898628-38922200-511b-11eb-965f-fb4d46d3c45c.png"></p>
<p>The <code>astfold_expr</code> before folding the expression at hand, tries to fold its child expressions (operands) and then delegates the folding to the corresponding specific expression folding function. The operation-specific folding function evaluates the expression and returns the evaluated constant value, which is then put into the AST.</p>
<p>For example, whenever <code>astfold_expr</code> encounters a binary operation, it recursively folds the two child operands (expressions) before evaluating the expression at hand using <code>fold_binop</code>. The function <code>fold_binop</code> returns the evaluated constant value as seen in the snippet below.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png" alt="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/103898745-670ffd00-511b-11eb-88a9-f741157473b3.png"></p>
<p><code>fold_binop</code> function folds the binary operation by checking the kind of operator at hand and then invoking the corresponding evaluation function on them. For example, if the operation at hand is an addition then, to evaluate the final value, it invokes <code>PyNumber_Add</code> on both its left and right operands.</p>
<h3>What makes this elegant?</h3>
<p>Instead of writing special logic to handle certain patterns or types to fold constant expressions efficiently, CPython invokes the same general code. For example, it invokes the same usual <code>PyNumber_Add</code> function while folding that it does to perform the usual addition operation.</p>
<p>CPython has thus eradicated the need to write special functions to handle constant folding by making sure its code and evaluation process is structured in such a way that the general-purpose code itself can handle the evaluation of constant expressions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img alt="rails saml abstract" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4e19e5a1a96df85fc6b0aedeb7ec10a2947d23e7/44b01/img/railssaml.jpg"><h3>SAML Background<a href="#saml-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>SAML SSO refers to an authentication mechanism preferred by enterprise companies. The SSO part stands for Single Sign-On. From the enterprise’s perspective, they desire a centralized service where their employees can authenticate, which then provides authenticated access to the applications they use for work. These services are called Identity Providers (IDPs), and they are the <em>Single</em> place where enterprise employees <em>Sign-On.</em> This is an alternative to employees using password-based authentication for each of the various applications they use.</p><p>The SAML part stands for Secure Assertion Markup Language. SAML utilizes a domain-specific flavor of XML that describes an authenticated user, encoded to a string and passed to your application in a query parameter. Your application decodes the <code>SAMLResponse</code> using a key that the enterprise provides to you.</p><p>The details of the SAML Response are less important than understanding the general flow. When a user wants to sign in using SAML, you must send that user to their Identity Provider with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> that identifies your application. The user signs in to their IDP, and is redirected back to you with the <code>SAMLResponse</code>. What makes this a tiny bit complicated for a multi-tenant application is routing the user to the correct IDP, as SAML SSO breaks our common understanding of a login flow.</p><p>A typical login screen might have an email and password field, then a few buttons to sign in with OAuth services, like Google or GitHub. But now, you’ll need to gather something from the user who wants to sign in such that you can send them to the correct IDP instance.  We like to say that SAML is <em>instance based</em>, especially when <a href="https://ossoapp.com/blog/saml-vs-oauth">compared to OAuth</a>, which we can think of as <em>class based</em>. Domain is a common key for this process - you can ask a user for their email, grab the domain, and use that as a key to find the correct IDP instance and redirect the user.</p><h3>Let’s Build and Iterate<a href="#lets-build-and-iterate" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Once you wrap your head around understanding the SAML flow, it’s really not challenging to implement SAML in a Rails app - IDPs themselves offer great open source libraries to help with your integration. You can definitely get very far in a day or two. But like most things in engineering, the last 10% can take 90% of the effort, and while we all love to say “I could build that in a weekend,” we often later eat our words when we realize all of the edge cases, documentation needs, scaling challenges and unknown unknowns that make this or any other project worth doing a bit more involved than a quick weekend hack.</p><p>I’m a co-founder of an open source company Osso - our microservice is a Ruby and React app that allows you to onboard SAML SSO customers, generates custom documentation for each customer to perform their onboarding tasks in their IDP, and allows your Rails app to consume Osso using OAuth - we even provide <code>omniauth-osso</code> to make consuming an Osso instance from your Rails app incredibly simple.</p><p>Osso also offers paid plans, and you can skip right to our <a href="https://ossoapp.com/pricing">pricing page</a> to learn more about hosted Osso if you need SAML yesterday. Or you can jump right in to <a href="https://ossoapp.com/docs/deploy/overview">deploying an open source Osso instance</a> from our GitHub repo. There’s certainly the possibility of using <code>osso-rb</code> in your Rails app directly — you’ll want to mount our 3 rack based apps, pull in migrations, etc. — but this post will focus instead on a microservices approach.</p><p><strong>So</strong>, if you’d like to begin from first principles, follow along here as we build up a production-ready SAML SSO integration, starting with a single tenant approach, then layering in multi-tenancy. Once we have multi-tenant support, we’ll address questions about scalability and serviceability — how can we repeatedly add additional tenants, without spending significant engineering or customer support cycles? I <em>will</em> encourage you to use Osso, and show you exactly how, but will also highlight the things you need to be considering in order to roll out a production ready SAML integration <em>without</em> Osso.</p><p>We’ll use a single Rails app repository throughout this tutorial. The <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main branch</a> is a barebones Rails 6 app with Devise and a User model, and for each of our steps below we’ll move to a feature branch so we can see a full diff. Each step adds more functionality, getting you closer to a production-ready, multi-tenant integration. Each step also uses open source software, where the library used in the previous step is a dependency of the next step’s library. Neat!</p><p>We’ll also make use of Osso’s <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock IDP</a> and <a href="https://demo.ossoapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo instance</a>, especially when we get into multi-tenancy. You’ll still want to register with an IDP for a developer account in order to have access to an IDP for a second tenant - we recommend an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta developer account</a>.</p><h3>Base Rails application<a href="#base-rails-application" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We’ll use the same Rails 6 application for each step - the source code is available [here] (<a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/saml-rails</a>). The <code>main</code> branch adds Devise with a User model to a brand new Rails app using Postgres as the database. The application doesn’t do anything - there is an index route and a logged in route that will tell you the email for the current user. This guide assumes proficiency with Rails, so it will skip some details. We’ll also use some intentionally naive approaches to demonstrate common challenges of SAML SSO. </p><h3>Single tenant<a href="#single-tenant" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h4>With ruby-saml and mock IDP<a href="#with-ruby-saml-and-mock-idp" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>My first experience with SAML was working on <a href="https://medium.com/@tsharon/democratizing-ux-670b95fbc07f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internal software at WeWork</a> where one of my Osso co-founders was a teammate. The IT department required us to use SAML SSO, which I at first was awfully annoyed by. Google OAuth was super easy, and could be restricted to domain, so what’s the deal with this OneLogin thing? Fortunately, single-tenant SAML was just as simple to implement, and admittedly did include some better security. This is a common situation — an enterprise company requires SAML, and it might seem silly to you, but them’s the rules.</p><p>Our project was a Rails app, and we used a Ruby gem from OneLogin to handle the actual SAML encoding and decoding. Since we were building this app for WeWork employees, we had a single tenant, and didn’t need to worry about implementing a scalable solution for multiple tenants, documenting how to set SAML up for the app or training our teammates on how it worked. We also didn’t need to change our login form - we knew every user would be sent to the same IDP instance, so we were able to use a simple <em>Sign in With OneLogin</em> button.</p><p>That’s what we’ll do here, and if you’re building internal software this will be a fine approach for your production release! We’ll use Osso’s mock IDP for this single tenant to keep things simple too.</p><p>First lets install the ruby-saml gem. We’ll include it in our Gemfile and run <code>$ bundle install</code>.</p><p>We’ll use this library in two ways:</p><p>First, when a user wishes to sign in with SAML, we use ruby-saml to generate a url with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> - the URL is where we will send the user to sign in, and the <code>SAMLRequest</code> is sent along as a query param in order to identify our application to the IDP.</p><p>When the user signs in to their IDP, they will be sent back to your application with a <code>SAMLResponse</code> query param. We then use ruby-saml to decode and validate the <code>SAMLResponse</code>, allowing us to access information describing the user, such as their email address.</p><p>Lets define a couple of routes and controller actions to handle this flow.</p><p>In the <code>saml_login</code> action, we create a <code>OneLogin::RubySaml::Authrequest</code> and redirect to the return value. Later, in the callback, we validate and decode the response, and will sign the user in and redirect them if valid. Otherwise we’ll raise the validation errors to understand where our SAML config went wrong.</p><p>This callback route will also need to accept a POST request with <code>www-url-form-encoded</code> parameters, so you will need to skip the Rails <code>verify_authenticity_token</code> <code>before_action</code>:</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p>Both of these actions depend on what ruby-saml calls <code>settings</code>. These values are created via the configuration you must perform between your application and the Identity Provider. In a real-world example, your application generates a few values which you provide to your customer. The customer uses these to configure your application in their IDP and returns some data generated by the IDP. We’ll discuss this process in more detail later. Since we are using the Osso Mock IDP we can mostly skip this configuration step, but it’s worth understanding what each of these values represents, how it functions and why it might prevent your user from signing in if misconfigured.</p><p>Each of the controller actions above calls a private method <code>saml_settings</code>. Since we are dealing with a single tenant, we will essentially hardcode the SAML configuration values to support this one IDP instance.</p><div><p>app/controllers/application_controller.rb</p></div><p><strong>Values you provide</strong></p><p><strong>ACS URL</strong> - The Assertion Consumer Service URL is where the IDP will send the user with a SAMLResponse when they log in. Similar to a Redirect URI in OAuth, your application will generate this value according to how your routes are set up.</p><p><strong>SP Entity ID</strong>  - Sometimes called the Audience URI, this is a unique identifier for the tenant in your application. This can get hairy! <strong>Google</strong> requires that they be unique for a customer, so you can't just use domain, while <strong>Azure</strong> won't let you use a UUID and <strong>Ping</strong> won't let you use a url. Those are just <em>some</em> of the edge cases we've found!</p><p><strong>Values the IDP provides</strong></p><p><strong>IDP SSO Target URL</strong> - The single sign on target URL tells your application where to send a user with a <code>SAMLRequest</code> in order to sign in.</p><p><strong>IDP Certificate</strong> - An x509 certificate which includes a public key that your application uses to encode and decode the SAML request and response.</p><p>Since we are using the Mock IDP, these values can be found in the Mock IDP’s federated metadata: <a href="https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/enterprise-oss/sinatra-ruby-idp/blob/main/metadata.xml</a></p><p>To enforce good security practices, we put the certificate in Rails credentials. We won't show you our whole certificate here, but here's part of an …</p></section></div>

<p>Update: There was a delightful discussion about functional programming and the nature of Rust at <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language">lobste.rs</a>.
</p><div>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
<p>Functional languages take away mutability from the “mutability + aliasing = bugs” equation; Rust takes away the aliasing — or at least, the uncontrolled aliasing. To me, it then makes sense to feel comfortable using mutability (and the advantages it offers), safe in the knowledge that the compiler is helping you avoid bugs. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_slxmwj">vfoley</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I don’t really agree with all of this. I agree that Rust gets the nice properties of functional languages at least when it comes to mutation, but if someone read the body of Rust code I have written and came back and said, “it really resembles the code I typically write on Lisp/ML/Haskell,” then I would be really surprised. I rarely write higher order functions. I rarely write recursive functions or folds. I rarely use persistent data structures and instead use mutation without reservation. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_aucsix">burntsushi</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_zbcp7s">andyc</a> pointed to <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/">Notes on a smaller Rust
</a> and quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I said once, pure functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
</blockquote>

  </div>
  <p><a href="">expand&nbsp;</a>
</p></div>

<hr>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/">Programming Rust</a> introduces Rust as...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not really an object-oriented language, although it has some object-oriented characteristics. Rust is not a functional language […] It’s probably best to reserve judgement about what sort of language Rust is, and see what you think once you’ve become comfortable with the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time for judgement has come! In the following I will lay out my view on how Rust’s language features influence programming style. I do agree with the aforementioned quote that Rust is not a single-paradigm language. Yet, the code written in idiomatic and safe Rust shares quite some similarities with code of functional programming languages.</p>
<p>“Functional programming language” is not a clearly defined term. From the various properties that are typically associated with functional programming I only want to focus on one: “Immutability” and referential transparency. Immutability means that data structures can be treated as values - once you have them, they will not change underneath you. If you want to express modification, you can construct a new data structure, maybe reusing (unchanged) parts of existing data. This enables referential transparency: If a function (or method) cannot change anything internally, its output only depends on its input. Given some input the function evaluation and the result it returns can be treated as the same. The function is said to be pure.</p>
<p>Immutability is often regarded as a very positive property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure code is deterministic and considered to be easier to reason about as the number of possible state combinations is limited.</li>
<li>If a function only depends on explicitly defined parameters, testing it is often easier.</li>
<li>Immutable data can be passed to concurrent code without worrying about synchron^izing access.</li>
<li>And it is free of cycles (unless you allow <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot">lazily evaluation</a>), making it easier to serialize and deserialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Rust clearly allows for data to be mutable. Rust also does not provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structures</a> in its standard library (although there are <a href="https://crates.io/crates/im">third-party</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rpds">options</a>) which are typically used to model immutable data efficiently. Yet, Rust’s rules around ownership require full control over what can be changed and when. To the extent that I have been working with Rust, a lot of it feels quite similar to programming Clojure from the point of view of designing programs.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-sharing-exclusivity">Ownership, sharing, exclusivity</h2>
<p>Each piece of data in (safe) Rust has exactly one owner. In the following example the variable <code>val</code> owns the String:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>.to_string();
</code></pre></div><p>Using <code>val</code> we can create references to the string:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// both val and val_ref can be used to read the string value:
</span><span></span>println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val);
println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val_ref);
</code></pre></div><p>However we cannot modify either <code>val</code> or <code>val_ref</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// cannot borrow `val` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
</span><span></span>val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);

<span>// error: "cannot borrow `*val_ref` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference"
</span><span></span>val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>So in order to change <code>val</code> we need to declare it <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>); <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>But now we cannot take a reference at the same time anymore:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>And similarly we can write to the reference if we declare it <code>mut</code> but then we cannot get another reference at the same time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref2 <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val;
</code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates Rust’s ownership rules: We can get multiple shared (read-only) references to one piece of data but as soon as we indicate to modify the data by declaring either the owning variable or a reference as <code>mut</code> we cannot hold shared references at the same time. <code>mut</code> means first and foremost <em>exclusive</em> access to the underlying data (and only secondarily <em>mutable</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, functions that want to modify parameters (or <em>self</em> in case of methods) need to indicate that they need exclusive access. This means that the caller can only use this function it has exclusive access to the parameters to be passed as <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>add_world</span>(val_ref: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> String) {
    val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
}
<span>// ...
</span><span></span>add_world(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val);
</code></pre></div><p>All this is to say: Mutability in Rust needs to be explicitly declared and the rules around exclusive access are statically enforced. A thing can only change if no one is looking — reducing the number of accidental state combinations and highlighting the parts of the code base that can introduce change clearly. A Rust function that only accepts shared references and owned values (that do not provide interior mutability) and that does not use unsafe code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is referentially transparent.</p>
<h2 id="interior-mutability">Interior mutability</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases where not being able to modify shared references can become very limiting. For example consider this <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/">GTK+3</a> app:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-03_is-rust-fp/interior_mutability.gif"> 
  </figure>


<p>The implementation for this looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> container <span>=</span> gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, <span>2</span>);
<span>// A label that will be modified
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label <span>=</span> gtk::Label::new(Some(<span>"Button not yet clicked"</span>));
<span>let</span> button <span>=</span> gtk::Button::with_label(<span>"Click me"</span>);
<span>// We clone label so we can send it into the closure.
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label_clone <span>=</span> label.clone();
button.connect_clicked(<span>move</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> {
    label_clone.set_label(<span>"Button has been clicked!"</span>);
});
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>button);
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>label);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the <code>label</code> is added to the container so that it gets displayed <em>and</em> is bound inside the closure where it gets modified.</p>
<p>Rust uses two mechanisms in combination for that to work: The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt"><code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. First, a reference counted pointer <code>std::rc::Rc</code> that is quite similar to C++’s <code>shared_ptr</code>. <code>Rc</code> takes ownership of another object. <code>Rc</code> implements <code>Clone</code> that will increase the ref count and hand out a new pointer. Those can be passed freely around. Inside of the ref-counted pointer a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a> can be placed. It will allow to request exclusive access to the data owned. I.e. it will — at runtime! — produce a <code>mut</code> reference to the object wrapped and check that it is indeed not borrowed somewhere else. Should this not be the case, the borrow will fail (and possibly panic if <code>borrow_mut()</code> was used).</p>
<p>For more details about the internals of smart pointers and interior mutability I can highly highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo">this screen cast by Jon Gjengset</a> that walks you through possible implementations of (among others) <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code>.</p>
<p>So Rust provides ways<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> around the statically enforced access rules that normally restrict modification of data. This provides enough abstractions to even implement an interface to an object-oriented system such as Glib / GTK+. Following that, you might argue that Rust is supporting multiple paradigms, and I will agree. Yet, similar to Clojure that provides “interior mutability”-equivalents like <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atoms</a> I will point out that overly relying on those features is not considered idiomatic. In Clojure the best practice is to use atoms sparingly. Mostly at the outside of the app, extracting state that is passed into the inner layers of the app that will then transform the state immutably into a new derived version. Atoms then clearly highlight where state changes can be expected. In practice, this then provides a good compromise. In case of stateful bugs, you only have to have a limited amount of possible sources to check and possible combinations of state transitions are still limited to simplify reasoning.</p>
<p>The <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern is also not all that ergonomic. Yes, you can define type aliases like Glib does, Rust still makes it easier to not have nested, cyclic relationships between objects. To say it with book Programming Rust again (from the section “Taking Arms Against a Sea of Objects”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When everything depends on everything else like this, it’s hard to test, evolve, or even think about any component in isolation.
One fascinating thing about Rust is that the ownership model puts a speed bump on the highway to hell. […] It works unreasonably well: not only can Rust force you to understand why your program is thread-safe, it can even require some amount of high-level architectural design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is exactly the point I would like to convey with this article and the reason why I’m personally so fascinated with Rust: The set of features it does (not) provide are forcefully guiding the design of systems you build. This is quite contrary to how a lot of programming languages that attempt to provide a high degree of flexibility work (looking at you, Scala).</p>
<p>And then this is my claim: The ownership model, standard library, emphasize on iterators, and numerous other things do lead to code that is usually …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/what-is-profiling/">last post</a> in our <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/tags/profiling-in-production/">Profiling in Production series</a> we covered instrumentation and sampling profilers. We talked about “resources of interest” but which ones are the most useful for diagnosing performance bottlenecks? The most commonly used resource is time. We’ve been deliberately vague about the concept of timing so far because when it comes to computers there’s actually two types of timing.</p>
<p>The first is <em>CPU Time</em>. This is the time that your code actually spends executing code on the CPU. The other type of time that we’re interested in measuring is <em>Wallclock time</em>. Wallclock time is the total time between starting an operation and it completing.</p>
<p><img alt="A coffee shop at lunch time" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/profiling_in_production_series/coffee_shop.png" title="A coffee shop at lunch time"></p>
<p>The way that we like to think of the difference between the two types of profiling is that it's a bit like buying a coffee. If you go to any good coffee shop, or a Starbucks at lunchtime, then you'll find they tend to be pretty busy with a queue forming at the bar. In order to drink the delightful caffeinated beverage you desire you need to both get through the queue to be served and also have the barista make your coffee. CPU Time is the time that the barista spends making coffee - it's the actual time spent performing work. The Wallclock time is the total time it takes for you to get a coffee including waiting to be served.</p>
<p>Now you maybe wondering why CPU Time and Wallclock time aren’t the same number: after all your Java process doesn't have to wait in line at Starbucks. Code may not be running on a CPU for a variety of reasons. For example, it might be blocked on a lock, not scheduled on CPU due to too many threads running or have gone to sleep.</p>
<h4>So when should you use the different types of time?</h4>
<p><em>CPU Time</em> is more useful for problems where there are few threads showing high CPU usage, as many event-loop style applications do. You may see plenty of time being spent in other threads that are waiting around performing background work but aren't actually limiting the throughput of your application. So CPU Time is useful when you know you’re bottlenecked on processing capacity. This is often the case in applications where significant processing needs to happen for each request or event. Machine learning systems are a common example.</p>
<p><em>Wallclock Time</em> is useful for problems where CPU utilisation seems low but application throughput or latency doesn't meet expectations. This is because threads are probably blocked on something, for example multiple threads contenting on a lock, times when you're waiting for downstream network IO to happen or running with too many threads so some of them don't get scheduled. The trigger for looking at Wallclock time would be low CPU usage during your period of performance issues. This tends to happen in modern microservices deployments when services spend time blocked on other services - which limits overall throughput.</p>
<p>In summary, so far in this series we’ve learnt about the relative merits of instrumentation and sampling profilers and the most common timing types and where they should be used. In the next post we’re going to cover how sampling Java profilers specifically work and how to pick one that’s suitable for production.</p>

Its a modern tool that is similar to Webpack, but takes a slightly different approach. Instead of bundling our entire application and recompiling on every code change and save, snowpack only rebuilds single files where the changes have been made.

The library is a renderer for Three, using it we can skip a lot of mundane work such as scene creation and concentrate on composing our components in a declarative way with props and states.</p><p>The renderer allows us to use all of the Three classes, objects and properties as elements in our markup. All classes constructors arguments can be accessed via an <code>args</code> prop. A simple mesh with a box class can be seen below. Don't worry if you don't understand what this means, we will go over everything shortly.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>mesh</span><span> </span><span>visible</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>rotation</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>boxGeometry</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>geometry</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>args</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>meshStandardMaterial</span><span> </span><span>attach</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>material</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>red</span><span>"</span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>mesh</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>MDX</p><p>Our page will be rendered in <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a></span>, a format which allows us to write JSX and include React components in markdown files. It's a wonderful development experience and one I hope you will fall in love with once we reach the end of the tutorial.</p><p>Install the fun</p><p>I have created a handy snowpack template that creates a project with snowpack, chakra and MDX all installed. It also comes with React Router v6 but we wont be using that so will remove that boilerplate.</p><p>Open a new terminal and navigate to your desired project folder and run the following which will create our new project. Change <code>my-new-app</code> to your apps name.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npx create-snowpack-app my-new-app --template snowpack-mdx-chakra</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Next we can install our projects dependencies.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>npm</span><span> i @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion react-three-fiber three @react-three/drei react-particles-js</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Now that we have our dependencies installed we can begin to tear out some of the stuff we wont need. Our landing page will encompass a single page so we can open the <code>mdx-routes.js</code> file and remove the <code>Nav</code> component and the page-two route from the <code>MDXRoutes</code> component. We'll return to this file later to add some styling but for now we can move on.</p><p>Inside the pages folder delete page-two and remove the contents from page-one. Inside the components folder delete the emoji component and add a new folder called 3d. And that's it, we are now ready to begin coding some sick 3D landing page goodness!</p><p>The layout</p><p>Open the <code>mdx-layout.js</code> file located in the components folder. This will wrap our whole app, in our case our one landing page. Our page will consist of a css grid, we'll use grid areas to get a nice visual representation of how our page will layout. Remove what is currently in there and add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>import</span><span> React </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> Flex</span><span>,</span><span> Grid </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'@chakra-ui/react'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> desktop </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span></span></p><p><span>'edge   .       .         .'</span></p><p><span>'edge   text    product   .'</span></p><p><span></span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>MDXLayout</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> children </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Grid</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateColumns</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr 10%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateRows</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>10% 1fr 1fr</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>templateAreas</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>desktop</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>bg</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.background</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100vh</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span>children</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Grid</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> MDXLayout</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Using Chakras Grid component we set the amount of columns to have a responsive padding of 10% of the viewport width on each side of two flexible one fractional units of space. This basically means that the meat of our page will live in the two fractional columns, with each taking up as much space as they need before they hit the 10% padding on each side. Our rows follow the same logic except we save 10% for our header row and the rest takes up as much space as needed. As you can see, we have a background color set on the bg (background) prop. But where does that value come from and what does it mean?</p><p>Open the <code>theme.js</code> file located in the <code>src</code> folder. This is our global theme for our app. We are importing the default theme from Chakra, which itself uses the Tailwind default preset. We are then overriding the colors with our own brand colors. The font sizes are also being overridden to allow us to use slightly different sizes to the default. Go ahead and copy the following colors object into the file instead of the current one.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>colors: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>..</span><span>.theme.colors,</span></p><p><span>    brand: </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      red: </span><span>'#ed1c24'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      lightGrey: </span><span>'#D6D6D6'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      background: </span><span>'#090d12'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>      text: </span><span>'#FFFfff'</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>Components in MDX</p><p>MDX is just markdown that you can write JSX in. So that means that we can write normal markdown like so:</p><pre></pre><p>But we can also add to that React components We can even compose React components right in the MDX file! Let's open up the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src</code> folder and check out how we can add components to our MDX file without using imports.</p><p>Let's break down what's going on in here. If we scroll to the bottom we can see an <code>MDXProvider</code> wrapping our app. It accepts a components prop into which we have passed a components object declared above. The components object allows us to map React components to markdown elements as well as passing in custom components for use in our MDX files. As you can see, this template has set this all up for us by mapping some basic markdown elements to some Chakra components. Where there is no object key we have passed in a custom component which can be used in the MDX file without importing it as you would in a normal js or jsx file.</p><p>MDX accepts a special key called <code>wrapper</code> which will wrap the entire file with whatever is passed to it. In our case it will take our previously created layout component along with it's grid and use that to wrap our MDX file. Now that we know where the components are coming from when using them in our MDX file, let's go ahead and write some React in markdown!</p><p>The header</p><p>Opening up the <code>page-one.mdx</code> file located in the pages folder, add the following.</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span> </span><span>gridArea</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>edge</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>gridRow</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>1</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>justify</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>align</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>ml</span><span>=</span><span>{6}</span><span> </span><span>as</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>header</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Image</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>w</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100px</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>https://www.transparentpng.com/thumb/nike-logo/Blc12i-red-nike-logo-clipart-png-photos.png</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>alt</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>Red Nike Swoosh Logo</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span></p></pre></div></pre><p>We are using the Flex component provided to us from Chakra via the <code>MDXProvider</code>. This component allows us to quickly apply flex box props to the base element, a div. Even though the component is based upon a div we can give it semantic meaning by utilizing the <code>as</code> props and setting it the header. If we check our layout file again and look at our grid areas we can see that we have <code>edge</code> on the first and second rows. So we have set the grid area to edge and the row to 1.</p><p>This places our component in the top left hand corner of the page. We have given it a margin-left (ml) so that it doesn't hit the edge. As you can see from the code block above, we are inserting an image. If you navigate to <span><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.transparentpng.com/search.php?q=nike">this</a></span> url you will see that it's a Nike swish (swoosh, tick? I dunno)</p><p>The copy</p><p>Let's add some copy to our page. This will be in the first column of our two middle columns. It will hold the title to our page and some copy about the Nike Air Jordan 1's, the product we are showcasing. Directly below the first Flex code block in the <code>page-one.mdx</code> file add the following:</p><pre><div><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>gridArea</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>text</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>justify</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>center</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>direction</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>column</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>100%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>maxH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>500px</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>w</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>90%</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>p</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.lightGrey</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>6xl</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            Air Jordan </span><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Flex</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span> </span><span>h</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>80%</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>position</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>relative</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>zIndex</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>101</span><span>"</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>my</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>fontWeight</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>300</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>xl</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>borderTop</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>solid 1px</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>pt</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        The Air Jordan that was first produced </span><span>for</span><span> Michael Jordan </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>1984</span><span> was designed by Peter </span><span>C</span><span>.</span><span> Moore</span><span>.</span><span> The red and black colorway </span><span>of</span><span> the Nike Air Ship</span><span>,</span><span> the prototype </span><span>for</span><span> the Jordan </span><span>I</span><span>,</span><span> was later outlawed by then</span><span>-</span><span>NBA</span><span> Commissioner David Stern </span><span>for</span><span> having very little white on </span><span>them</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span> rule</span><span>,</span><span> known </span><span>as</span><span> the </span><span>"51 percent"</span><span> rule</span><span>,</span><span> was repealed </span><span>in</span><span> the late </span><span>2000</span><span>s</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Text</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Text</span><span> </span><span>my</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>fontWeight</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>300</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>color</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>brand.text</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>fontSize</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>xl</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>borderBottom</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>solid 1px</span><span>"</span><span> </span><span>pb</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>6</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        After the Nike Air Ship was banned</span><span>,</span><span> Michael Jordan and Nike introduced the Jordan </span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> colorways </span><span>with</span><span> more white</span><span>,</span><span> such </span><span>as</span><span> the </span><span>"Chicago"</span><span> and </span><span>"Black Toe"</span><span> colorways</span><span>.</span><span> They used the Nike Air Ship</span><span>'s ban as a promotional tool in advertisements, hinting that the shoes gave an unfair competitive advantage.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SREs are responsible for evaluating tools that can help reduce toil on their teams and make their applications more reliable for end-users. There are a lot of SRE tools out there, and it can be hard to know which ones are the most important to consider. We’ve compiled this guide to highlight the key categories of SRE tools and help you find the right fit for your team.</p><h2>Monitoring tools</h2><p>Monitoring tools are used to generate valuable metrics and insights about an application and help SREs do everything from creating benchmarks to debugging outages. Luckily, there are monitoring tools for practically anything you might want to measure relating to your application. These tools usually cover one or more of the following areas:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Application performance monitoring (APM)</strong>: Models the response times perceived by end users of your application and compares this against performance benchmarks to detect latency and outages.</li><li><strong>Network monitoring</strong>: Examines all the incoming and outgoing traffic routed through your network to help with load balancing, debug client/server issues, and stop network attacks like DOS attacks before they occur.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resource / infrastructure monitoring: </strong>Looks at the consumption rates and SLOs for the components of your application, like the CPU load for your Kubernetes clusters, to help with resource management.</li></ul><h3>What to look for in a monitoring tool</h3><p>No matter what type of monitoring tool you’re looking at, you’ll want to investigate the following important features:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Alerts: </strong>The tool should be able to generate alerts when metrics approach and exceed the thresholds that your SRE team identifies.</li><li><strong>Automated incident response: </strong>Ideally, your tools will also try to automatically fix any detected issues where possible, helping reduce your engineering overhead.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Logging: </strong>Your monitoring tool should create detailed logs that contain all the information you would need to debug an issue, with configurable highlighting for easier consumption.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Visualizations and dashboards: </strong>Monitoring tools offer various kinds of graphics and charts to help you interpret the data at a glance or communicate with your stakeholders. Depending on your use cases, you might want to look for tools that support certain types of data round-ups and visual representations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supported integrations: </strong>Your tool should work seamlessly with your application components and services.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common monitoring tools</h3><p>Here are some of the monitoring tools that we hear about often from SREs:&nbsp;</p><h4>Open-source tools</h4><p><a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank">Prometheus</a>: A popular monitoring tool with an active community and broad range of features.</p><p><a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank">Grafana</a>: Helps you make dashboards and visualizations by integrating with other monitoring tools (often combined with Prometheus).&nbsp;</p><h4>Tools you can purchase</h4><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">AppDynamics</a>: A platform focusing on APM (though it also offers network and resource monitoring).</p><p><a href="https://www.appdynamics.com/" target="_blank">DataDog</a>: Offers a suite of monitoring tools to cover many different use cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html?utm_campaign=google_amer_en_search_brand&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=Splunk_Enterprise_Demo&amp;utm_term=splunk&amp;_bk=splunk&amp;_bt=386199173970&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=43997962767&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAq8f-BRBtEiwAGr3DgVfR2eqnx8gp6gDbtDTiPEVAcjJaAjRnT_mHhy8nUGRst6ycdQC_RBoCwmkQAvD_BwE">Splunk</a>: A generalized tool for managing large-scale data and deriving actionable insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>On-call management tools</h2><p>SREs and engineers are often responsible for being on call during working and non-working hours, prepared to react immediately to resolve any issue that might threaten the system’s health. Being on call can be stressful, and you want to be careful not to burn out your team. Fortunately, there are many tools SREs can use to help reduce the burden and make being on-call a bit less painful.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an on-call management tool</h3><p>While most on-call tools also help your team manage the incident itself, we’ll be covering incident management in the next section. Here are some on-call rotation specific features to help you prioritize your assessment:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Scheduling on-call rotations</strong>: Your tool should help you distribute the on-call duty equally and fairly across your team, with flexibility in case someone needs to trade on-call rotations at the last minute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sharing on-call calendars</strong>: Sometimes an issue touches multiple components, and several on-call engineers need to be involved in the incident response. For that reason, it’s important that your tool provides a centralized way to view the on-call calendars across your organization.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Alerting on-call engineers: </strong>This one is pretty obvious, but it’s absolutely essential. Your on-call tool needs to integrate with your monitoring tools to deliver alerts, and it must provide a payload with enough context so that the on-call engineer can address the issue. Your tool should also give you rules-based configurations for alert routing and controls to combat spammy alerts, which lead to burnout.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common tools for on-call management</h3><p>Popular on-call management tools include <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/software/splunk-on-call.html" target="_blank">PagerDuty</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Splunk OnCall</a> (formerly VictorOps), and Atlassian’s <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/opsgenie" target="_blank">Opsgenie</a>.</p><h2>Incident management tools</h2><p>Inevitably, failures will occur in your system, and the person on-call is going to need powerful tools to help fix issues in the moment and make sure that they don’t happen again. According to <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/being-on-call/" target="_blank">Google’s SRE Book</a>, managing an incident successfully comes down to three things: (1) clear escalation paths, (2) well-defined response procedures, and (3) a blameless post-mortem culture. SREs can find tools to codify these practices and help your team communicate better and resolve incidents faster.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an incident management tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Issue triage: </strong>Your tool should help you configure issue types and severity levels so that you know how to prioritize and when to escalate.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Escalation pathways: </strong>Whether issues are manually or automatically escalated, you should be able to quickly get the right people involved and easily share all of the context they need to understand the issue.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Runbooks / workflows: </strong>Depending on the issue classification, your tool should hand over the runbook of predefined steps the on-call engineers need to follow. Your tool should also be able to automatically execute workflows if certain conditions are met.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Real-time communication: </strong>Your tool should integrate with the apps your team uses to communicate, like Slack, Jira, or even Zoom, to share information automatically and free you up to focus on the issue at hand. It should also create a historical document of the incident response that your team can refer to later on.</li><li><strong>Data-driven issue analysis: </strong>Ideally, your tool will give you all the data you need to understand what happened and focus on how it can be avoided next time, instead of placing blame on individuals.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common incident management tools</h3><p>All of the on-call management tools previously mentioned also feature some form of incident management. Additional dedicated tools for this purpose include <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">Blameless</a>, <a href="http://servicenow.com/" target="_blank">ServiceNow</a>, and Netflix’s open source crisis management tool, <a href="http://blameless.com/" target="_blank">Dispatch</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Configuration/Automation tools</h2><p>A main function of the SRE role is to automate away the mindless and busywork tasks of software development. Automated configurations can be used to ensure that toil is reduced and the same steps are always repeated when provisioning, managing, and destroying resources.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in an configuration tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Infrastructure as code: </strong>This paradigm means that your infrastructure specifications live in a file, which can be run to recreate your configuration in the event of an outage. Most automation tools will have their own language for declaring the desired configuration.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Execution planning: </strong>Your tool should offer a preview of the effects of your changes before you run the automation, to make sure there are no unanticipated consequences.</li><li><strong>Automated workflows:</strong> The tool should allow you to enforce steps that are always followed when performing a task, like deploying an application, and let you run these workflows automatically.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Supports container orchestration: </strong>If you use a container orchestration service like <a href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank">Kubernetes</a> to deploy your services, your configuration tool should be compatible.</li></ul><h3>Common configuration tools</h3><p>Popular tools for automating your infrastructure configurations are <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Terraform</a> and <a href="http://terraform.io/" target="_blank">Ansible</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Microservice catalog tools</h2><p>To make sure that incidents are avoided in the first place, SRE teams should look for tools that help them enforce high-level policies and best practices. A key tenet of microservice catalog tools should be governance over your service oriented architecture. Governance refers to <em>what </em>rules and processes the team follows, as well as <em>who </em>is responsible for reliability across different services and applications. This helps avoid tribal knowledge, and is especially important when teams work remotely and manage many different microservices.&nbsp;</p><h3>What to look for in a microservice catalog tool</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Supports a production readiness review (PRR): </strong>A key process for SREs is a PRR: stepping through a predefined checklist to make sure that the software is ready to deploy. This might include things like ensuring that you’ve set up load balancing and end-to-end testing.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Transparent ownership: </strong>This tool should create a catalog of services with their owners clearly identified, so it’s easy to look up who is responsible for what.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Integrates with your </strong><a href="https://www.getcortexapp.com/list/integrations" target="_blank"><strong>existing tools</strong></a><strong>: </strong>All the best practices you’re trying to enforce should be visible within one tool. This means, for example, that your APM set-up and on-call rotations should appear alongside the catalog of your services, so you don’t have to refer to multiple tools to know where to find important data.</li><li><strong>Automatic updates: </strong>When your configurations or policies change, you shouldn’t need to make manual edits in the tool.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Common microservice catalog tools</h3><p>The most common governance tool we’ve seen is unfortunately a giant spreadsheet (or, worse, several spreadsheets!). Since this is the opposite of the SRE philosophy, we’ve created Cortex to fill the gap. Our <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5f727be73405af82f83b0972_Screen%20Shot%202020-09-28%20at%205.01.49%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>microservice catalog</strong></a><strong> </strong>makes it easy to see your services and owners in one place, and we foster accountability and show you how to improve using a gamified <a href="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad1413d6c1261e587937/5ecc28b2e9133b2ab44992a2_Screen%20Shot%202020-05-25%20at%201.20.53%20PM-p-1080.png" target="_blank"><strong>scorecard</strong></a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p>With the right tools, your SRE team will be able to spend their energies improving your product’s reliability and performance instead of dealing with toil and overhead.

<p>I thank Daniele F. for donating this terminal. He contacted me from&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/donate/">donation page</a>&nbsp;at the end of May but I couldn’t&nbsp;retrieve it until&nbsp;the beginning of October, when I passed through&nbsp;Verona while I was going to Brusaporto (a few kilometres from Bergamo) where I attended an annual <a href="http://www.brusaretro.it/">retrocomputing meeting</a>.</p>

<p>The terminal, after a thorough cleaning and an accurate inspection, turned on without any problems. It was just dusty and dirty.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - dirty" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-dirty-7240-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>The first item I started to clean was the keyboard. The next picture shows it before and after the cleaning process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - keys before / after" width="1080" height="889" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-1024x843.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-keys_before-after-7241-624x514.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>
<p>I know that I’ve said it before… detaching and cleaning every single key is boring. But it is a manual and repetitive task&nbsp;that frees&nbsp;my mind, I find it quite&nbsp;relaxing, and the final result is always&nbsp;worth the time spent. Look at the next photo: beautiful, clean, shiny keys, with that mechanical feeling&nbsp;I sometimes miss on modern keyboards.</p>

<p>Here’s the keyboard board without the keys, after being cleaned:</p>

<p>The next picture shows the detail of the key.</p>

<p>There was no need for a “keycap puller”, the keys came off easily – so easily that I was lucky that no key was lost in all these years. This image is taken from the technical manual I found on the net.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png" alt="Digital VT100 - key exploded view" width="800" height="997" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key.png 800w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-300x374.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-241x300.png 241w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/key-624x778.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a></p>
<p>After the keyboard I cleaned the main unit. The “Lunar” badge was probably&nbsp;added by the seller or the distributor, but I couldn’t find any information about it. Under the badge you can see the original colour of the case. If you look closely, you can see that the CRT monitor has a ghost image caused by showing the same static text many hours a day for years.&nbsp;Here’s the teardown picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - teardown" width="1248" height="5816" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-300x1398.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-220x1024.jpg 220w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-teardown-624x2908.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>There’s a sticker under the keyboard, used to keep track of the terminal settings. In the setup screen that you can see in the first picture there are 4 series of 4 bits: each one sets an option, explained in the manual and summed up on the sticker.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png" alt="Digital VT100 - setup" width="1248" height="593" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370.png 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-300x143.png 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-1024x487.png 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/digital_vt100-setup-7370-624x297.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The unit was designed with easy reparability in mind. The top and bottom case are kept together with just four clips; a few other clips keep the main unit attached to the bottom case.</p>
<p>The motherboard and the graphic board can be pulled out by unscrewing a panel on the back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - back" width="1248" height="858" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363.jpg 1248w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-back-7363-624x429.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px"></a></p>
<p>The power supply unit can be pulled from the main by lifting –&nbsp;you’ve already guessed – some clips.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg" alt="Digital VT100 - power supply unit - insertion" width="1080" height="817" srcset="https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330.jpg 1080w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-300x227.jpg 300w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://www.oldcomputr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/digital_vt100-power_supply_unit-insertion-7330-624x472.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"></a></p>

<p>The Selanar Graphics 100 is an additional third party board that lets the terminal show&nbsp;132 columns on screen and use advanced character formatting. It’s based on an Intel 8085 processor.</p>

<p>The most useful site I found about the VT100 is <a href="http://vt100.net/">VT100.net</a>; you can find the technical manual on the <a href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_decterminaT100TechnicalManualJul82_24218672">Internet Archive</a>. The only information about the Selanar Graphics 100 came from a Google Book scan of <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=I_GaHXKwFpMC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;pg=PA48#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Computerword magazine</a> from August 1980. It cost $1195, and on the same page there’s an ad for the VT100 at $1550. That makes a total of $2745, that according to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">usinflationcalculator.com</a>&nbsp;corresponds to $7926 in 2015. For a terminal!</p>

<h2 id="announcing-krator">Announcing Krator</h2>

<p>Last September the Krustlet project refactored our API to employ a state
machine pattern for describing the lifecycle of Pods. The design of this API
was covered in depth in my
<a href="https://deislabs.io/posts/a-fistful-of-states/">previous blog post</a>.
Since then we have made a number of refinements to this interface and extended
our use of the pattern to individual containers within each Pod. These changes
also served to simplify and make more generic our API, and were done in part as
a stepping stone to the crate we are announcing today.</p>

<p>Since introducing this API, we have experienced positive feedback from the
community, including a number of requests to generalize this state machine
architecture so that it can be used to build Kubernetes Operators. It turned
out to be fairly straightforward to extract the “operator” portion of Krustlet
to a new crate, and today we are pleased to announce Krator (pronounced
crater), which stands for [K]ubernetes [R]ust st[at]e machine Operat[or].
Krator was released alongside the latest release of Krustlet, <code>0.6.0</code>, and
Krustlet now uses Krator internally to watch Pods and manage their state
machines.</p>

<p>Implementing an Operator involves a number of moving parts, so I have put
together a fairly minimal example, which I will walk through in the rest of
this post. If you just want to browse the code, it currently lives in the
Krustlet GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/tree/master/crates/krator">here</a>, and
documentation can be found on <a href="https://docs.rs/krator">docs.rs</a> (once Krustlet
<code>0.6.0</code> is released).</p>

<h2 id="writing-an-operator">Writing an Operator</h2>

<p>As an example, we will create an operator to manage <code>Moose</code> custom resources.
Using Krator, we will write a state machine that will describe the possible
states of a <code>Moose</code>, and how it should transition between these states. First,
we must write a custom resource definition, which is very easy using the
<code>CustomResource</code> derive macro from the <code>kube</code> crate!</p>

<pre><code>use kube_derive::CustomResource;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(CustomResource, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Default)]
#[kube(
    group = "animals.com",
    version = "v1",
    kind = "Moose",
    derive = "Default",
    status = "MooseStatus",
    namespaced
)]
struct MooseSpec {
    /// Shoulder height in meters.
    height: f64,
    /// Body weight in kilograms.
    weight: f64,
    antlers: bool,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each <code>Moose</code> has a spec which includes height, weight, and whether it has
antlers. <code>CustomResource</code> lets us also specify that a resource should support
the Kubernetes <code>status</code> API, which is required for a Krator Operator. We
specified that our status type was <code>MooseStatus</code> which we will define as
follows:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
enum MoosePhase {
    Asleep,
    Hungry,
    Roaming,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
struct MooseStatus {
    phase: Option&lt;MoosePhase&gt;,
    /// ~ Moose noises ~
    message: Option&lt;String&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>As our state machine transitions to new states, Krator will automatically
update the object’s status with the Kubernetes API. To do this, Krator requires
that this status type implement a trait, <code>ObjectStatus</code>:</p>

<pre><code>impl ObjectStatus for MooseStatus {
    /// Use to generate an error status if an unhandled error occurs.
    fn failed(e: &amp;str) -&gt; MooseStatus {
        MooseStatus {
            message: Some(format!("Error tracking moose: {}.", e)),
            phase: None,
        }
    }

    /// Converts the arbitrary status type to a JSON patch to send to
    /// Kubernetes.
    fn json_patch(&amp;self) -&gt; serde_json::Value {
        // Generate a map containing only set fields.
        let mut status = serde_json::Map::new();

        if let Some(phase) = self.phase.clone() {
            status.insert("phase".to_string(), serde_json::json!(phase));
        };

        if let Some(message) = self.message.clone() {
            status.insert("message".to_string(), serde_json::Value::String(message));
        };

        // Create status patch with map.
        serde_json::json!({ "status": serde_json::Value::Object(status) })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we need to define data types for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data that is shared across state handlers for a single object (moose in this
case)</li>
<li>Data that is shared across state machines (shared between objects)</li>
</ul>

<p>We must also implement a trait, <code>ObjectState</code> which lets Krator know how all
of these types relate to the state machine.</p>

<pre><code>struct MooseState {
    /// All moose names start with 'M'
    name: String,
    /// Food mass in kilograms.
    food: f64,
}

struct SharedMooseState {
    /// Map moose name to set of moose friend's names (moose friendships are directed).
    friends: HashMap&lt;String, HashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;,
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl ObjectState for MooseState {
    type Manifest = Moose;
    type Status = MooseStatus;
    type SharedState = SharedMooseState;

    /// Clean up data related to a specific object.
    async fn async_drop(self, shared: &amp;mut Self::SharedState) {
        shared.friends.remove(&amp;self.name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We are now ready to implement our state machine. Below is a diagram of the
states we will represent. When a <code>Moose</code> object is first created, Krator will
initialize the state machine in the <code>Tagged</code> state. This will populate our
shared state and then transition to the <code>Roam</code> state. The moose will roam the
wilderness and with some probability encounter other moose and become friends.
Eventually, the moose will get hungry and transition to the <code>Eat</code> state, which
will replenish its <code>food</code> level but also make it tired. It will then transition
to the <code>Sleep</code> state for 60 seconds before returning to the <code>Roam</code> state. Note
that the final state, <code>Released</code>, is only reached when the <code>Moose</code> object is
marked for deletion in the Kubernetes API and Krator interrupts the state
machine and transitions to <code>Released</code>. In some operators, end states are also
reachable under certain conditions from within the state machine graph, such as
a Pod transitioning to <code>Completed</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://deislabs.io/images/moose-state-machine.svg" alt="Moose State Machine"></p>

<p>State implementations are currently a little verbose, so I will include a
single state implementation here. The rest can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/master/crates/krator/examples/moose.rs">the complete example</a>.
The important information is within the <code>next</code> and <code>status</code> methods of each
trait implementation. The <code>status</code> method is called when each state is
<em>entered</em>, so it should describe the state it is associated with. We have
considered using macros for implementing <code>State</code>, but have not been satisfied
with Rust’s error messages for errors originating from within these macros. If
you have any experience with macros and think you can come up with something
nice, please let us know!</p>

<p>The <code>next</code> method is the main code block for each state, sometimes referred to
as the state handler. This method has a number of important arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes ownership of <code>self</code>.</li>
<li>An <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> to access shared state. For more information on this API,
see the
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.0.2/tokio/sync/struct.RwLock.html">Tokio documentation</a>.</li>
<li>A mutable reference to the object state.</li>
<li>A <code>Manifest&lt;_&gt;</code> which acts as a
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#efficient-detection-of-changes">reflector</a>.
This type implements the <code>Stream</code> API for detecting changes to the object
manifest within a state handler, or you can simply call <code>latest</code> to obtain
a clone of the current object manifest.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default)]
/// Moose is roaming the wilderness.
struct Roam;

async fn make_friend(
    name: &amp;str,
    shared: &amp;Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;
) -&gt; Option&lt;String&gt; {
    let mut mooses = shared.write().await;
    for (other_moose, friends) in mooses.friends.iter_mut() {
        if name == other_moose {
            continue;
        }
        if !friends.contains(name) {
            friends.insert(name.to_string());
            return Some(other_moose.to_string());
        }
    }
    return None;
}

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl State&lt;MooseState&gt; for Roam {
    async fn next(
        self: Box&lt;Self&gt;,
        shared: Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;SharedMooseState&gt;&gt;,
        state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: Manifest&lt;Moose&gt;,
    ) -&gt; Transition&lt;MooseState&gt; {
        loop {
            tokio::time::delay_for(std::time::Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
            state.food -= 5.0;
            if state.food &lt;= 50.0 {
                return Transition::next(self, Eat);
            }
            let r: f64 = {
                let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
                rng.gen()
            };
            if r &lt; 0.05 {
                if let Some(other_moose) = make_friend(&amp;state.name, &amp;shared).await {
                    info!("{} made friends with {}!", state.name, other_moose);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    async fn status(
        &amp;self,
        _state: &amp;mut MooseState,
        _manifest: &amp;Moose,
    ) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;MooseStatus&gt; {
        Ok(MooseStatus {
            phase: Some(MoosePhase::Roaming),
            message: Some("Gahrooo!".to_string()),
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To finish our state machine, we must define valid transitions between states.
The compiler will ensure that we do not make invalid transitions, which helps
us to avoid undefined behavior.</p>

<pre><code>impl TransitionTo&lt;Roam&gt; for Tagged {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Eat&gt; for Roam {}
impl TransitionTo&lt;Sleep&gt; for Eat {}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, Krator provides a macro for deriving this trait:</p>

<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default, TransitionTo)]
#[transition_to(Roam)]
/// Moose is sleeping.
struct Sleep;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally we must implement the <code>Operator</code> trait to tie this all together. Note
that the state machine API itself does not require that the <code>Manifest</code> is a
valid Kubernetes API resource. This allows the state machine pattern to be used
with a broader set of types (we used it for containers, which are not a
Kubernetes resource type). This, however, will require you to reimplement the
function which drives the state machine, as we did for
<a href="https://github.com/deislabs/krustlet/blob/3b120ec6a00123afd1407d049b61282c67e71676/crates/kubelet/src/container/state.rs#L18">containers</a>.</p>

<p>To get the full benefit of Krator, which watches for changes to your API
resource, spawns state machines, and handles status updates, you will need to
satisfy additional trait bounds which are placed on associated types of the
<code>Operator</code> trait. Namely, <code>Manifest</code> must be
<a href="https://docs.rs/k8s-openapi/0.10.0/k8s_openapi/trait.Metadata.html"><code>Metadata&lt;Ty = ObjectMeta&gt;</code></a>,
<code>DeserializeOwned</code>, and <code>Default</code>. <code>Status</code> must be <code>ObjectStatus</code> (as
described above).</p>

<h2 id="forward-kinematics">Forward kinematics</h2>
<p>Calculating the current coordinates of a robot’s hand is easy.</p>
<p>We just need to look at each segment of a robot’s arm–the coordinates of the segment’s base, the direction of the joint’s axis, the angle between this segment and the next one, and the length of the segment–in order to calculate where the end of this segment is. Repeat this with each segment, until we arrive at the robot’s hand. Et voilà: we determined the hand’s position.</p>
<p>This is called forward kinematics.</p>
<h2 id="inverse-kinematics">Inverse kinematics</h2>
<p>Now the robot’s arm must adjust each joint’s angle in order to move its hand over the cup. This is quite the opposite of the previous calculation - here, we start with a given position and want to know how to rotate each segment of the arm.</p>
<p>It turns out that this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_solution">much harder</a> than the forward case. And whenever something is hard to solve, there are usually several different approaches available for solving that problem. For inverse kinematics, there are three of them:</p>
<ol>
<li>The algebraic approach: This basically works by solving (frankly, rather complex) matrix equations.</li>
<li>The geometric approach: The idea is to combine knowledge about the robotic arm’s geometry with suitable trigonometric formulas.</li>
<li>The numeric approach: Take a guess and look how far we are off. Move one or more segments to locally minimize the error. Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one to pick? After all, each of them has its raison d’être.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, let’s drop the first one. It involves a lot of matrix calculations, and frankly, I haven’t done any since the last millennium or so.</p>
<p>The second one, the geometric approach, can become quite complex when the robot’s arm consists of many segments and joints. Luckily, all complexity vanishes in the case of a simple robotic arm with only two segments, so let’s go with this approach. (In a future article, I’ll give the numeric approach a try.)</p>
<p>At this point, I must admit that when I started working on this article, I expected that the formulas for the simple two-segment arm could easily be generalized to multi-segment, multi-joint robotic arms, but I found that this is not the case. So for this article, we’ll stick with what is probably the most simple robotic arm with rotary joints.</p>
<h2 id="the-scara-robot">The SCARA robot</h2>
<p>Our robotic arm shall meet the following requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The arm has only two segments of fixed length.</li>
<li>The segments can only rotate around their base joint; there is no sliding movement.</li>
<li>The axes of both joints have the same direction.</li>
<li>There is no hand attached to the end of the arm. (Robot hands would have additional degrees of freedom, and remember that we want to keep things simple. Now you know why our robot just serves tea.)</li>
</ul>
<p>A robot of this kind is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA">SCARA robot</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a schematic diagram of our robot:</p>

<p>Let me just tweak the diagram a little by replacing some of the labels and adding one line and two angles:</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/robotarm.png" alt="The SCARA robotic arm as a triangle"></p>
<p>This diagram tells us a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The segments have the length <em>len1</em> and <em>len2</em>, respectively.</li>
<li>The root joint describes an angle <em>A1</em> measured from the x axis.</li>
<li>The second joint describes an angle <em>A2</em> measured from the first segment (counterclockwise in both cases).</li>
<li>The tip of segment 2 points to <em>(x,y)</em>, and we want to calculate back from that point to the yet unknown values of <em>A1</em> and <em>A2</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the diagram you also see a new dotted line named <code>dist</code>. It points from <em>(0,0)</em> to <em>(x,y)</em>, and as you can easily see, the three lines <code>dist</code>, <em>len1</em>, and <em>len2</em> define a triangle. Furthermore, <em>dist</em> divides angle <em>A1</em> into two angles <em>D1</em> and <em>D2</em>.</p>
<p>Now is a good moment to dig out an old trig formula you may remember from school: The law of cosines.</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/lawofcosines.png" alt="The Law of Cosines"></p>
<p>The law of cosines (see the first formula in the figure above) is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem (c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> for right(-angled) triangles) to arbitrary triangles. We do not need the basic form, but rather the transformed version that you can see below the original formula. With this version, we can calculate angle <em>C</em> from the triangle’s sides <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>. This comes handy in two places, as we’ll see shortly.</p>
<p>So how do we calculate <em>A1</em> and <em>A2</em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the robotic arm diagram above (the one with <em>D1</em>, <em>D2</em>, <em>dist</em>, etc), we can directly derive the first formula:</p>
<pre><code>A1 = D1 + D2
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>D1</em> is fairly easy to calculate. In the following diagram, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>dist</em> define a right-angled triangle. Here, <em>D1</em> can be calculated in two ways: The arcsine of <em>y/dist</em> or the arctangent of <em>y/x</em>. As we have x and y readily available, let’s choose the arctangent formula.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem hidden here. The formulas certainly are correct if x and y are positive, but what if either of the two, or even both, are negative? Luckily, a solution is available in form of a method from the standard library: <code>math.Atan2(y, x)</code>. It delivers the correct result for all possible combinations of x and y. (More details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions#Application:_finding_the_angle_of_a_right_triangle">on Wikipedia</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/arctan.png" alt="D1 is calculated as arctangent of y/x"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>D2</em> requires the law of cosines.
Basically, we just map our “robot triangle” to the “law of cosines” triangle by using <em>dist</em> as <em>a</em>,
<em>len1</em> as <em>b</em>, and <em>len2</em> as <em>c</em>. The resulting angle <em>C</em> is our <em>D2</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/calcd2.png" alt="D2 and the law of cosines"></p>
<ul>
<li>Now only <em>A2</em> is left. Luckily, we can reuse the law of cosines for this. We only need to map our triangle to the one from the law of cosines with different parameter mappings than for <em>D2</em>: <em>len1</em> as <em>a</em>, <em>len2</em> as <em>b</em>, and <em>dist</em> as <em>c</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://appliedgo.net/media/roboticarm/calca2.png" alt="Calculating A2"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s it. Let’s pour this into code now.</p>
<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
</div><div>
<h2 id="homework-assignment">“Homework assignment”</h2>
<p>Why does <em>A1</em> evaluate to <code>NaN</code> (“Not a Number”) when we try moving the arm to (0,0)?</p>
<p>Hint 1: It is about the law of cosines function.</p>
<p>Hint 2: The arm does not form a triangle in this case. (Yes, this hint is actually a spoiler, sorry…)</p>
<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>
<p>In a future article we’ll look into the numeric approach. That is, we let the robot iteratively move its arm in small steps until it reaches the target.</p>
<p>Next week’s article is a lightweight take on Dependency Injection.</p>
<p>Until then, have fun!</p>

<p>Updates</p>
<p>2017-01-13: Fixed: The code uses Atan2 to calculate D1, but the text used Pythagoras.

<p><span>Y</span>esterday, I got into a verbal altercation at Starbucks.</p>
<p><span>An older man, talking very loudly, said something along the lines of “My son is golden because he has a degree from Stanford University.”</span></p>
<p><span>This comment really infuriated me because this type of outdated thinking—that a college degree from an elite, pricey university means you’re set for life—must die immediately. It falsely </span><b>signals</b><span> to employers that you’re better than the average Jane just because you have a piece of paper. In reality,</span><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <span>all it really signals is your family’s socioeconomic status</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>So I interjected and said, “Let me guess… You paid for your son’s education.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I did,” he said. “My son’s grandfather was Herbert Hoover, and my son’s degree is like gold.”</span></p>
<p><span>[Eye roll]</span></p>
<p><span>I preceded to tell him that it doesn’t matter if you have a college degree anymore to do today’s jobs and that he was basically bragging about his family’s socioeconomic status, not his son’s actual achievements. I tried to elaborate about the inequalities of higher education and why it’s an outdated metric of future success. I explained why employers are absolutely wrong for thinking his son is better than someone without a degree or a degree from a public university.</span></p>
<p><span>Then he told me to go fly a kite, because that’s usually what happens when people are wrong and have zero evidence that their stance is right and yours is wrong. (I’m always open to new ideas, SO LONG AS you present trustworthy facts, stats, and research.)</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, this man is an out-of-touch elitist, and I stand by everything I said to him.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/stanford-university"><b>Fun fact</b></a><b>: The median family income of a student from Stanford is $167,500, and 66% come from the top 20%.

<h2><span id="Degree_requirements_lead_to_less_diversity"></span><b>Degree requirements lead to less diversity</b><span></span></h2>
<p><span>Recruiters use software, known as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which I discuss in detail in a </span><a href="https://www.thevectorimpact.com/how-to-apply-for-jobs-online/"><span>previous article</span></a><span>. ATS collect, sort, and filter job applicants who apply through an online form.</span></p>
<p><span>They use this tool because the average job post receives 250 applications today, and they need a way to save time filtering down candidates.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes, online application forms will feature “knockout questions,” like “Where did you graduate from?” “What year did you graduate?” and “What did you major in?” These are meant to automatically weed out candidates who don’t meet certain criteria.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, if I—a college dropout—were to apply to a job with these knockout questions, I’d automatically be filtered to the rejection pile, with not one human actually taking the time to even scan my resume. All because I don’t have a Bachelor’s degree, despite my 10 years of professional, proven experience.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if application forms don’t feature knockout questions, recruiters are likely inputting “keywords” into their ATS, searching for words like, “Bachelor’s,” “Harvard,” etc., just to quickly filter down the amount of resumes they have to review.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me be clear: Filtering candidates by degree is the epitome of wrong and legally,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>it’s actually discriminatory</span></a><span>, which could be a massive liability for companies requiring a Bachelor’s degree or higher to even be considered for employment.</span></p>
<p><span>This sounds like crazy fake news, but according to an article on the reputable legal encyclopedia,</span><a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/is-discriminatory-require-applicants-college-degree.html"> <span>NOLO</span></a><span>, I’m right.</span></p>
<p><span>In the post, a reader asks if requiring a college degree for employment is illegal:</span></p>
<div>
<p><b>I work for a large nonprofit employer whose mission is to help inner-city children finish high school and go on to college.</b></p>
<p><span>We do fundraising, provide tutors and coaches, work with teachers and parents, and help school districts come up with strategies and resources to reduce dropout rates, among many other things. Our employees do everything from sending out mailings and answering phones to lobbying Congress to helping kids with their math homework and college applications.*</span></p>
<p><span>Recently, the Board decided to require all new employees to have a college degree. </span><b>The Board feels that it would be great for the kids and their families we work with to see the benefits of staying in school; the Board has also said that having employees who never finished high school or college runs counter to the message we’re trying to send about the importance of education.</b></p>
<p><span>I can see their point, but I’m concerned that this requirement might screen out large numbers of applicants of color. Is it legal for us to adopt this hiring requirement?*</span></p>
</div>

<p><b>*Side-note:</b><span> Why are so many entities STILL preaching college as the only way to get a job and succeed in life, when 50% of grads are underemployed or unemployed today? See chart below.</span></p>

<p><b>NOLO’s answer:</b></p>
<div>
<p><span>Whether or not a hiring requirement is discriminatory depends on its intent and its effect. Some employers adopt screening tests or criteria with the purpose of screening out certain applicants. For example, imposing a strength test would have the effect of screening out larger numbers of women. If an employer’s intent is to discriminate, and its hiring criteria are simply a smokescreen for this true purpose, then the employer is discriminating. </span><b>But even if an employer has no intent to discriminate, its hiring criteria may have that effect.</b><span> If a selection test or requirement has a disproportionate effect on applicants in a particular protected category, that might be illegal discrimination. </span><b>The key is whether the requirement is truly necessary to do the job.</b><span> For example, a strength test might screen out disproportionate numbers of female applicants, but might also be necessary for a job as a firefighter, construction worker, or logger.</span></p>
<p><b>An employer whose screening test or requirement has a disparate impact on a protected group must show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</b><span> This is intended to be a difficult hurdle, but not an impossible one. For example, an attorney needs to pass the bar exam to practice law, so requiring applicants for an associate position at a law firm to be admitted to the bar would meet this test. Similarly, </span><b>many skills tests</b><span> would pass legal muster, as long as the exam tested skills that truly were necessary to do the job.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements are more slippery, in part because it isn’t clear exactly what particular skills, aptitudes, or abilities a degree confers</b><span> (unless a particular degree is required for licensing, like a law degree or medical degree generally is). </span><b>And, degree requirements often do have a disparate impact against African American and Latino applicants.</b></p>
<p><span>…</span></p>
<p><span>Your Board has expressed a nondiscriminatory reason for its new requirement. </span><b>But a court would look at whether it really is necessary to have a college degree to do every job at your company.</b> <b>The variety of jobs employees hold is going to be a major strike against the requirement: It seems pretty evident that someone can stuff envelopes, answer phones, manage databases, and do a wide variety of other work without a college degree.</b></p>
<p><span>And, </span><b>even if a court were to accept the employer’s “role model” argument for certain positions, an applicant could still win a discrimination lawsuit by showing that there are less discriminatory alternatives available.</b><span> For example, an employee might be an even more effective advocate for staying in school if he or she can share how difficult it has been to succeed without a degree. An employee who has dropped out might be better able to relate to the decisions facing at-risk kids and better able to help them make a different choice. </span><b>In short, if a degree requirement has the effect of screening out larger numbers of African American and Latino applicants, your employer will face a very difficult task in trying to justify the disparity.</b></p>
</div>
<p><span>That last sentence is key. Today, the hot topic in HR today is “diversity.” Diversity for women, for latinos, for African-Americans, etc. But these are actually vanity metrics at best (or total lies at worst) if the company requires a college degree for employment—whether or not they realize it.</span></p>
<p><b>Degree requirements actually lead to less diversity.</b></p>
<p><b>The strongest predictor of entrance and completion of a degree at a top-tier university isn’t merit, but</b><a href="https://www.americaspromise.org/news/pbs-newshour-biggest-predictor-college-success-family-income"> <b>family ability to pay</b></a><b>.</b></p>

Did that there may be a effective bond among animals and human beings?<br>

one of the more stunning and unifying factors of humanity is witnessing the super lengths a few animal lovers will go to for his or her animal partners.<br>

Non animal lovers won't get it in any respect... yet.<br>

So right here's the aspect: They enjoy a mutual, deep bond and connection that is tough to provide an explanation for or define, however it would not make it any much less real or tangible.<br>

Many humans have learned the advantages of getting pets. And a puppy of any type, whether or not it's a cat, dog, horse, lizard, or chicken who feels cherished and comfortable, will bring superb joy to their human.<br>

while a few pet proprietors visit extravagant lengths for his or her fur babies - throwing them complex weddings or birthday events or dressing them up in excellent costumes - even the simple act of acknowledging their loyalty and love for you is a present in an effort to acquire a lifetime of rewards.</p><blockquote><b>Pets are a window to our soul.</b></blockquote>

one of the many advantages of having pets is when they show you who you certainly are. They do this by reflecting, mirroring and appearing out aspects of your inner self. And while you be aware of their messages they will let you become a better character.<br>
that is the phenomenon I name The Human Animal BodyMind Connection and it's an exquisite thing that after you understand it, it'll alternate your lifestyles.<br>
They haven't any capacity for spite or guile.<br>
while you concentrate to them, what are they announcing about how you are worrying for yourself... and them?<br>
they will innately reflect your feel of fitness and well-being. they may be attuned in your power - mind, frame and feelings - and might ship you messages about brewing troubles long before others can understand symptoms of trouble.<br>
And, they may be a tremendous comfort at some point of times of pressure, isolation or loneliness.</p><blockquote><b>Health benefits of having pets</b></blockquote>

we've got all heard clichés like, "puppies are guy's satisfactory pal."
but have you ever puzzled why? i will tell you my belief...<br>
dogs are loyal to a fault.<br>
Animals locate joy within the simplest, smallest matters.<br>
They don't have any want for excuses or pretense, they are handiest ever being themselves.
They doze off unencumbered with the aid of daily concerns and wake up each morning with a clean slate, geared up to take on the sector with sparkling eyes and spirits.<br>
Their buoyancy, resilience, devotion, willpower, and optimism are infectious.<br>
yet, many animals also have an innate feel when a person is in want of guide. They don't always take on the fear... they honestly attain out to consolation a person in ache.
now not each dog, cat, or horse can be a therapy animal who trains for care in a health center, as a provider animal or accomplice all through instances of crisis...<br>
but you ought to know that your pet is choosing up alerts from you always.
Your horse will experience the tension in you and attempt to make feel of it, then determine how to help you with that.<br>
Your canine will comply with you around the house when they examine bad strength trying to discern out what is wrong and the way to help you.<br>
you might assume they're being a pest - particularly while you're feeling agitated. stop and receive the present of their love for what it is, and have a conversation with them about what's bothering you. you'll feel better for it, and when you recognise how to talk with animals they may have the ability to inform you what they think too.</p><blockquote><b>Animals understand when things are going wrong, but they lack the power to fix them... or do they?</b></blockquote>

endless studies have proven that there may be recuperation strength in having a cat purr to your lap, having a canine rest their head on your lap, having a horse remain nonetheless even as you stroke their face.<br>
studies has found out that the bond among human beings and their pets will increase health, lowers stress, and produce pleasure to their proprietors. a number of the numerous blessings of having pets are that human beings experience:<br>
-reduced blood strain<br>
-decreased cholesterol levels<br>
-accelerated possibilities for workout and out of doors activities<br>
-decreased triglyceride tiers<br>

Pets might not will let you withdraw, isolate, or cocoon all on my own

it's very tough to socialize in trendy international... and that may magnify despair, tension, and a sense of isolation.<br>

Your pet needs your care and attention all through desirable times. They need to play games with you, pass for walks with you, study from you. And, at some point of horrific instances they nonetheless need all those things, but can sense that things are not right, when you're in pain.<br>

whilst your canine turns into obsessed on bringing you a toy, or appears to be nagging you to go for a stroll, pay attention to them.<br>

Your cat might be circling your house office chair, pouncing for your computer, intent on distracting you... however absolutely, they're in all likelihood telling you it's time to alternate your consciousness.<br>

often they will word that your respiration has end up shallow, your flow is weakening, and your strength is faltering... it worries them. Time to take a spoil!<br>

Time spent caring for a pet releases serotonin and dopamine, two hormones that cause a pleasure reaction.<br>

Pets are relatively intuitive creatures. And the more time they spend with you, the better they get to realize you and end up attuned for your lows and highs.</p><blockquote><b>The benefits of having pets go beyond heroic rescue dogs</b></blockquote>

all of us have a image in our mind of German Shepherds locating misplaced youngsters within the woods, exceedingly skilled Golden Retrievers who've learned to feel seizures of their proprietors, therapy dogs that go to hospitals to comfort patients...<br>
however pets do not should be doing "heroic" deeds to be a hero in your existence, and they don't need to all be puppies either.<br>
Birds, bearded dragons, horses, chickens all make a difference.<br>
accept as true with it or not, watching your goldfish swim in and out in their little citadel for 10 minutes lowers your blood pressure, and your stress.<br>
Having a pet...<br>
forces you to cognizance on a person vulnerable outdoor yourself, and take the time to have a tendency to their wishes which helps you generally tend on your very own desires as well

<p>For an author whose natural range tends to settle somewhere north of 500 pages of beautifully crafted fiction – his sixth, highly anticipated novel, <em>Crossroads</em>, is due later this year and promises to be another discursive, immersive classic – you could easily write off <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-If-We-Stopped-Pretending/dp/0008434042/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=franzen&amp;qid=1612359830&amp;sr=8-1"><em>What If We Stopped Pretending</em></a> as a non-fiction amuse bouche to turn your nose up at while you impatiently wait for the main course to arrive. Especially so, when the material involved is reissued work.</p> 
<p>Fans of the author will tell you, however, that his non-fiction volumes – old, new or reissued – are just as compelling as his novels. And so it is with this release, too.</p>

</div> 
<p>Franzen being Franzen means that <em>What If We Stopped Pretending</em> is an exquisitely rendered discussion on one of the most difficult conversations of our age.</p> 
<p>The author has previously angered both sides of the climate debate and been accused of being either too forceful or too weak. What emerges here is an accidental polemic and one that's worth re-evaluating, especially because our world has changed so dramatically in the past 12 months.</p> 

<p>He believes that the world is too far down the track to avoid a climate change catastrophe. It is a case of when, not if, the whole system collapses in on itself. The goal has been clear for decades, the evidence to support it is indisputable but, he writes, we have made no progress towards reaching it.</p> 
<p>He paints a bleak portrait of collective failure to solve the puzzle, imagining any future reckoning as a sequence of “severe crises … things will get very bad, but maybe not too soon, and maybe not for everyone. Maybe not to me”.</p> 
<p>This is where the work begins to intersect with our lives today.</p> 
<p>It is a little over a year since the <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion">Covid-19 crisis</a> began to rain down on us. The first cases were identified in the UAE at the end of January 2020. By the end of February, schools across the country were cancelling trips. By March 8, schools were closed. Within days, the World Health Organisation had declared a pandemic. Within a week, the UAE’s borders were closed. And so it went on, locally, nationally, regionally and internationally.</p> 
<p>The crisis, which we all may have initially imagined as a short, sharp shock, punctuated by short-term stay-at-home orders, movement permits and night-time street sterilisation campaigns, became a long and intricate fight – a sequence of severe crises, which were delivered unevenly and in complicated waves.</p>

<p>Most of us have endured some form of pain during the pandemic – of separation, loss, complication or even infection – but we have also been made more profoundly aware of how the actions of the individual and the community can truly make a difference. Governments may introduce and revise guidelines for containing the spread of the virus, but ultimately action is most effectively driven by each one of us acting responsibly and in the interests of the wider community in which we live.</p> 
<p>The distribution of vaccines in the UAE shows the power of what can be achieved by working together. By midweek, the National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority recorded that more than <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/gulf-news/coronavirus-vaccine-in-the-gulf-what-we-know-so-far-1.1158405">3.5 million vaccine doses</a> had been administered in the country.</p> 
<p>Health official Dr Farida Al Hosani said this week that “we are seeing good progress on a daily basis”. The reasons for that progress are many, including the liberal use of public awareness campaigns, the establishment of vaccine distribution centres in accessible places, the ease of registration to receive the vaccine and so on. But ultimately for the drive to be as successful as it has been to date, it also requires each individual to understand that they have a role to play by <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/to-get-the-jab-done-governments-must-show-patience-and-empathy-1.1121842">taking the jab</a>.</p>

<p>Returning to Franzen, the climate change crisis requires collective action as well, but it also needs each individual to make the right choices about how they lead their lives and to understand how even small changes to their lifestyles can still make a difference. Each of us, he says, has an ethical choice to make. “If collective action resulted in just one fewer devastating hurricane … it would be a goal worth pursuing,” he adds.</p> 
<p>The pandemic has also made it clear that generational crises are not abstract concepts but visceral realities. It has spurred some multilateral movement to combat coronavirus and given us a greater sense of the vast amount of effort, resource and capital that is required to turn the tide. We cannot just rebuild, we must regenerate. We cannot return to normal or even the so-called new normal. The challenges are too urgent and too complex to snap back into an approximation of the old order.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, John Kerry, who is the Biden administration’s climate change envoy, <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/environment/us-climate-envoy-john-kerry-to-build-ties-with-uae-to-boost-green-agenda-1.1157382">held talks with Dr Sultan Al Jaber</a>, his UAE counterpart. Mr Kerry said the US was prepared to re-energise the battle to protect the environment and spoke about making up for “lost years with humility and ambition”. That is precisely the prescription that it required to bring about a better, less calamitous future.</p>

			<p><strong>[INTERVIEW]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[00:01:31] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Hello, everybody. Thanks for tuning back in to The Secure Developer. Today, we’re going to have a DevOps-flavored episode here. I’m really happy to have with us James Turnbull, who is a VP of Engineering at Timber and also kind of a long time DevOps thought leader. He has been the chair of Velocity, has sort of been very much a core part of the DevOps journey, making him especially qualified to discuss a little bit about how it’s similar or different to the DevSecOps journey. James, thanks for coming on to the show.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:01] James Turnbull:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:02] Guy Podjarny:</strong> James, before we dig into the topic of substance, tell us a little bit about what is it that you do and maybe your journey and how we touch security?</p>
<p><strong>[00:02:10] James Turnbull:</strong> Sure. I lead engineering product teams. At the moment, I’m working a product called Vector, which is an open source observability tool. I’ve been an engineer for about 25 years. I think it’s too many years to start citing that, and I started my career off largely in sort of enterprise, banking finance, as a security engineer and a security architect for a few years in a retail bank, I built perimeter systems and ATM networks and stuff like that. In the last 10 years or so, I’ve largely worked in high-growth startups. I was an early employee at Puppet, configuration management tool. I was an early employee at Docker obviously doing containerization. I was a CTO at Kickstarter and I have done similar sorts of roles over the last few years. As you said, I was the chair of the Velocity conference for a couple years and also I write technology books. I’ve written 11 books about engineering and infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:00] Guy Podjarny:</strong> 11 books is impressive. I have a few under my belt but 11 books is definitely a notable number there.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:06] James Turnbull:</strong> No kids I think is probably an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:08] Guy Podjarny:</strong> It makes for some free time. So, I’m curious a little bit. Quite a few guests that came onto the show have gone into security from maybe the operations, and you actually were in security but then you moved outwards. Do you remember that transition, that decision point of whether you want to leave security and go to a role that doesn’t have security in the title?</p>
<p><strong>[00:03:29] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I was managing a CERT team, a Computer Emergency Response Team, at a retail bank, and one of the things I’ve been thinking about last three or four years before that was sort of large scale infrastructure management. One of the very frustrating things about being a security person in a large organization is you don’t control the infrastructure. You are largely dependent on infrastructure teams to provide you with information about vulnerabilities, about the state of the infrastructure. You’re largely reliant on them to do remediation for you. They would obviously come to me and say, “We don’t have any tools that allow us to mass maintain, mass patch all of these systems. We don’t use large-scale package management. We don’t have any configuration management tools.”</p>
<p>I sort of started to look in that area, about the same time I found Puppet. I started working on the open source Puppet tool. When they raised some money, I thought I can see the viability of this tool. I work in the environments where this is a desperate need. So, I came on board at Puppet to try and bring some of that experience, and I think I was probably our first pre-sales person, as well as being head of community and professional services, and a bunch of other things along the way. I tried to inject that flavor of this is what a large enterprise looks like. This is their experience. This is the empathy I have for their problems. The very first customer, I was involved in the New York Stock Exchange, customers that sort of flavor where my experience resonated.</p>
<p><strong>[00:04:47] Guy Podjarny:</strong> That’s a great story, and it’s interesting around this, taking ownership basically or being frustrated about not being able to control and address those issues. You very much scratched your own itch with the move to the solution itself in the world of Puppet. That’s pretty good.</p>
<p>It’s actually interesting that Puppet, I think, recently, maybe in the last couple of years, have actually launched a remediation-focused solution that indeed focuses. It sounds maybe like on the same problem space that you’ve just been describing as [inaudible 00:05:15].</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:15] James Turnbull:</strong> Yeah. I’ve had a couple of steps at it. [inaudible 00:05:17] was a product manager there for a while, originally built a sort of patch management, vulnerability management system like 2012 or 2013 but it proved to be – It’s a non-trivial problem to solve. But, yes, it’s definitely one of those areas where we have a lot of information about vulnerabilities. We have a lot more ability to interrogate hosts and work out what’s wrong. We still have the challenge of how do you remediate those in a safe and reliable way? How do you ensure that there’s no downtime?</p>
<p>I think those problems are the ones that Puppet is trying to work out, how do we solve? How do we take these feeds of data and turn them into actions or execution that organizations can undertake?</p>
<p><strong>[00:05:55] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah, very much. I mean, there’s also been some surrounding changes with the adoption of Kubernetes, as you pointed out, the ability to interrogate environments and ask for more information.</p>
<p>Let’s indeed maybe go down this path of the DevOps analogy and maybe a reverse path of your journey and talk a little bit about the analogies in the DevOps journey and in these changes of tools. Where is it that we can learn from them in security versus where do they defer and should be defined differently?</p>
<p>I thought maybe a helpful model for us to try and follow here is this people process technology type trial. Let’s start from that first one there, people. Maybe I’ll start by having you describe because people have different definitions of the people aspect of DevOps. When you think about people change is required to do DevOps successfully, how do you answer that?</p>
<p><strong>[00:06:45] James Turnbull:</strong> I mean, I think the people aspect of DevOps to me is probably the most important aspect of it. My best interactions or my best successes in building things or working on things or operating things was because I had good relationships with the folks all part of the process, whether they be software engineers, DBAs, or security people, or audit risk people. It’s a relationship-driven process.</p>
<p>To me, the DevOps thing is really about building a bridge between folks who previously perhaps didn’t have a conversation. There wasn’t necessarily any antagonism there. It was literally like, I do a job. I build an artifact. I give that artifact to some other people. Those other people do something with it, and sometimes they come and tell me that it’s broken.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously there’s a little bit of friction in there with regards to like the op side of things, get other people that live with the outage and so forth, but it’s really about like, okay, the Ops people have a set of expectations and constraints, and they have some needs. If they had a conversation with the people building the thing in the first place at first principles, would some of that process be smoother? Would the friction be reduced? Would the potential for outages be reduced?</p>
<p>To me, having a conversation, having a good relationship, understanding everybody’s needs is the key to that sort of DevOps thing. Obviously, there’s lots of tools and those bits and pieces in that automate a number of those processes and sort of reduce the human effort requirement, but it all stems from having that conversation in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:12] Guy Podjarny:</strong> Yeah. I very much relate to this but I guess maybe let me ask you, from a security change perspective. Now, when you think, okay, we’re going to do DevSecOps, and I’m using this buzzword fairly loosely over here, it’s just a simple way of saying embed security into the DevOps existence if you will, or processes, do you see the same? Do you also think really the most important piece is the people piece?</p>
<p><strong>[00:08:35] James Turnbull:</strong> I think so. I think there’s a couple of levels of this. When I started out in security, there was a generation or even a couple of generations before me who saw their role as saying no to things. They really saw themselves as guardians of the business and the enterprise. The easiest way to safeguard those organizations was to say, “No, we shouldn’t do this.”</p>
<p>I probably belong to the next generation that came along. I left security about the same time as this was becoming more sort of status quo, but a bunch of people who really said that our job is not to say no. Our job is to say present the risk, present options about how you might mediate the risk in some way, with a view to like allowing the business to do what it needs to do to make money in a fast and efficient and safest way possible. It’s their risk appetite and not our risk appetite. Our job is to explain to them the decisions they’re making and what the impact is, but it’s really their ownership. They own the business risk in a way that we don’t.</p>
<p>I feel like this resonates really strongly with me in this sort of DevOps sort of the world is ultimately the outcome is you want to move fast and ship things, right? You want to be able to take the time from code, not earning you any money on a developer’s desktop, to code running in production, and making your business money. One of the sort of caveats in there, one of the things in there, is you want to do that in a secure way, as well as an efficient set of ways. Security becomes another stakeholder in that DevOps life cycle, and their job is really to say, “Okay. We have policy or we have process, or we have information we need from you that bubbles up and allows us to do our jobs. If we give you that …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>State-of-the-art neural networks nowadays have become extremely parameterized in order to maximize the prediction accuracy. However, the model also becomes costly to run and the inference latency becomes a bottleneck. On resource-constrained edge devices, the model has a lot of restrictions and cannot be parameterized as much as we can.</p>



<p>Sparse neural networks could perform as good as dense neural network with respect to the prediction accuracy, and the inference latency becomes much lower theoretically due to its small model size. Neural network pruning is a method to create sparse neural networks from pre-trained dense neural networks.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do pruning. More details about the mathematical foundations of pruning for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Pruning/">â€œPruning for Neural Networksâ€�</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-pruning">PyTorch Pruning</h3>

<p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning, a ResNet18 model is first pre-trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of $86.9\%$. The pre-trained is further pruned and fine-tuned. The number of parameters could be reduced by $98\%$, i.e., $50\times$ compression , while maintaining the prediction accuracy within $1\%$ of the original model. The source code could be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Pruning-Example">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The pruning is overall straightforward to do if we donâ€™t need to <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/pruning_tutorial.html#extending-torch-nn-utils-prune-with-custom-pruning-functions">customize the pruning algorithm</a>. In this case, ResNet18 is able to achieve $50\times$ compression by using L1 unstructured pruning on weights, i.e., prune the weights that have the smallest absolute values.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    

    <p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/blocks.css">blocks.css</a> adds a layer of dimension to your web elements.
        It's light enough that it takes no time to set up or load, but interesting enough that it can serve as the only
        major CSS on the page.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>blocks.css is a single stylesheet. Get started by adding the stylesheet to your page's head.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/blocks.css/dist/blocks.min.css" /&gt;</pre>

    <p>This is a blocky button. It's interactive â€“â€“ try hovering and clicking on it.</p>
    

    <p>You can make any element blocky by giving it the class <code>block</code>.</p>

    <pre>&lt;button class="block"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Accents</h3>

    <p>This is an <em>accent</em> button. You can make a block accented with the class <code>accent</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Pills</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>round</em> button, also sometimes called a "pill". You can make a box round with the class <code>round</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Fixed blocks</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>fixed</em> button, which means it won't respond to any of your inputs or interactions. You can make
        a block fixed with the class <code>fixed</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Wrapper blocks</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, you want to blockify an element like <code>img</code> or <code>input</code>. But these elements can't
        have children like <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements, so blocks.css can't work its magic.
        Instead you'll have to wrap them in a <em>wrapper block</em>, using the <code>wrapper</code> class, like this.
        (The wrapper class removes padding in the block.)</p>
    <p><img src="https://linus.zone/pic" alt="Linus's picture">
    </p>

    <h3>Inline blocks</h3>

    <p>Lastly, sometimes you may want to place a block <em>inline</em>, or in the middle of a line of text. You can do
        so with an <em>inline</em> block, by adding the class <code>inline</code>. Then your blocks can be in the middle
        of text, <span>like this</span>.</p>

    <h2>Core components</h2>

    <p>We've only looked at buttons so far, but anything can be blocky. Here are a few examples.</p>

    <p>These are all just created by either adding the <code>block</code> class on a normal HTML element, or by wrapping
        normal HTML elements in <code>&lt;div class="wrapper block"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>

    

    <div>
        <pre>This is a blocky code block (inside a wrapper)</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLf9q36UsBk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
        <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Theming</h2>

    <p>You can theme button styles by customizing the colors, using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS custom properties</a>.</p>

    <p>There are four variables that blocks.css uses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-text-color</code> determines the color of text, and the border around the block and its
                shadow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-background-color</code> is the color of the button background</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-accent-color</code> is the background color of accented buttons</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-shadow-color</code> is the fill color of the shadow</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a more colorful palette, by changing the <code>--block-accent-color</code> within just this div.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a dark theme, made possible by setting the text, background, and shadow colors to be their inverses.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>

  <article>
    

    <p><strong>Monday, February  1, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>It seems like everyone these days is developing in containers. Specifically, I mean running your local development environment almost entirely in containers. There's a lot to be said for it, especially when you're bringing new developers into a project: it can be an invaluable way for anyone new to the project to quickly get all the tooling set up with a lot fewer "works on my machine" issues. But everything involves tradeoffs, so today we're going to focus on what some of the drawbacks of containers are. Also because it's my blog, so I write about what I want, dammit, and containers have been bugging me a little lately!</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that have been bugging me, and that make me just want to run processes directly on my host.</p>
<p><strong>Installing and managing packages takes extra work.</strong> Using Python as an example, it's pretty easy to get packages installed for any project that's using a modern dependency manager like <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a> or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">pipenv</a>. You just run something like <code>poetry install</code> and it will setup a virtualenv for you (essential to have reproducible builds, isolated between projects). The tool is there, and you just use it, but you can wrap it in a Makefile for convenience if you like. But if you're using Docker, you get a lot of extra steps. For one, you have to make sure that the dependency manager's generated virtualenv is persisted on your host, not just in the container, else you will be reinstalling those dependencies every time you start a container. (Or you can install the dependencies into the <em>image</em>, but then you have to rebuild the entire image and install <em>every</em> dependency to just add one for testing something out, adding unnecessary friction.)</p>
<p><strong>Actually, everything takes extra commands.</strong> You want to install a new package? Oh, open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to compile your program? Open a shell into your container, <em>then</em> install it. You want to launch the development server? You guessed it... And yes, I know the pedantic comments are going to be "well, actually you can do this in one command with <code>docker run</code>"—okay, but that's not better: now you've just made the one command you need to run <em>far</em> longer.</p>
<p><strong>File permissions are a pain in the butt.</strong> If you have a directory mounted on the host and in the container (<code>node_modules</code>, for example) then in all likelihood the files created inside the container are going to be owned by <code>root</code> since everything runs as <code>root</code> by default. When you're your normal user outside the container, you now will have challenges doing things like deleting that directory—and it produces a lot of really noisy output when you use something like <code>grep</code>, because suddenly there are a lot of files you cannot read! There are solutions to this, making the container use the same userid as your user on the system, but I have not found anything that worked well. It's just not worth the effort, and you're left with a nuisance every time you generate files inside a container.</p>
<p><strong>Retaining history is difficult.</strong> Getting your bash history retained between containers is a challenge, but I understand it's doable. Now you use a Python shell, so you need to configure that one for history as well.  Then you start using Elixir, so you need to configure history for it as well. Everything that normally works out of the box when you're developing on your host directly? You have to configure it and figure out which files you need to share between containers and the host to make it work. You usually figure this out by the pain of <em>not</em> having the history, and eventually someone on the team will patch it to make it work (mostly). But... at what cost? You get this for free by just, you know, using the host.</p>
<p><strong>Performance is horrible on Macs.</strong> I use Linux as my only operating system (Ubuntu specifically), but many colleagues past and present prefer using Macs. With the latest hardware advances from Apple, this is going to hold true going forward. And yet the performance is tangibly worse for Docker on Macs, because you have to run it inside a VM. (Windows cleverly skirts this problem by running the Linux kernel directly, not inside a VM; Mac OS could certainly take a similar approach in the future, if they prioritize developer experience. I am not optimistic.)</p>
<p><strong>Integration with tooling isn't great.</strong> We've had a tough time at <a href="https://remesh.ai/">work</a> getting IDEs like PyCharm or VS Code to play nice with our containerized setup. They support containers, but they don't seem to support containerized monorepos very well. Or that's what I've seen from the problems my colleagues have run into. I've fiddled with it a bit. As a vim user, it doesn't affect me personally, but it is a big issue when considering the impact on the team at large.</p>
<p>So, yeah, containers are pretty great. I'm glad we have them, and I <em>love</em> having them for use in production environments. But locally? Most of the time, I think you're better off running what you're developing directly on your local machine. You get a robust, easy-to-use setup that doesn't throw away a lot of the features you get for free (history!). There are benefits to either approach, but the old tried-and-true methods deserve some love.</p>

<![CDATA[Wvim: Quickly edit shell scripts, aliases, and functions]]>
            </title>

February 3, 2021 | https://ctoomey.com/writing/which-plus-vim-wvim | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ctoomey.com/writing/which-plus-vim-wvim">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
  <p>Over the years I’ve collected an array of one-off scripts, shell aliases, git
subcommands, etc., and I often find myself wanting to reference or edit of one
of them. Sometimes I know where to look, but not always, and when in doubt I
rely on the <code>which</code> command to point me in the right direction.</p>

<p><code>wvim</code> is a script that I’ve built to streamline these sort of edits. It started
as a simple wrapper around <code>which</code> — <code>function wvim() { vim "$(which $1)" }</code> —
but over time I’ve added support for shell functions &amp; aliases, as well as git
aliases and scripts. The thing that tipped this into the “oh wow, that’s pretty
cool” space for me was the addition of tab completion by leveraging the existing
tab completion for <code>which</code> via <code>compdef wvim=which</code>.</p>

<p>Using it looks something like this:</p>

<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" controls="" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/72f38f70e9318ad832a3a3d083ff721193825df2/e9a66/assets/videos/wvim.mp4">
</video>

<h2 id="show-me-the-code">Show Me The Code!</h2>

<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/configs/wvim.zsh">my current version of this script in my dotfiles
repo</a>,
but for completeness, I’ve included the contents of the file below. You can use
it by including the code in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file (or by splitting it out into
its own file for organization purposes if you share my penchant for clean config
files).</p>

<p><em>Note</em> - the <code>compdef</code> completion line is zsh-specific, but I believe the rest
should be reasonably portable to bash or other similar shells.</p>

<h2 id="caveats-and-limitations">Caveats and Limitations</h2>

<p>Given that <code>wvim</code> is built out of various regex checks and heuristic searching
logic, I’ve been impressed by how well <code>wvim</code> has worked for me.</p>

<p>That said, there are a few assumptions baked into this script, most notably that
I have it configured to look in both <code>~/.zshenv</code> and <code>~/.zshrc</code>. If you don’t
have both those files, you’ll want to update that to only reference the file you
have.</p>

I actually click on lots of crazy Trump ads because I’m curious who’s paying for them.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_7');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_7">[7]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_7">And (spoiler) I did not vote for the Trumpster.</span></span> And if you’re trying to persuade <em>undecided</em>&nbsp;voters who to vote for, it’s pretty unlikely they’re going to go from “I don’t know who to vote for” to “OMG TAKE MY MONEY!”</p>
<p>But here’s a crazy idea: what if we showed people ads <strong>and then just&nbsp;asked&nbsp;who they planned to vote for?</strong></p>
</div><div><p><a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical Turk</a> is a marketplace for extremely small, web-based tasks. The tasks (called Human Intelligence Tasks or HITs) are usually just an HTML form, possibly with some links to external media. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/07/11/the-requesters-a-mix-of-academics-and-businesses/">Common Mechanical Turk tasks</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying objects in images (usually for ML training)</li>
<li>Transcription (i.e., from audio to text)</li>
<li>Surveys (either academic- or marketing-related)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691610393980">Several</a> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=1626226">studies</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1357054.1357127">attest</a> that Mechanical Turk can provide survey responses that match or exceed the quality of traditionally-administered surveys. And—most importantly for the 2020 election—you can do it without actually <em>talking</em> to anyone!</p>
</div><div><p>In a past life <a href="https://tjcx.me/p/i-wasted-40k-on-a-fantastic-startup-idea">I read a lot of randomized controlled trials</a>. I might not be a scientist but I can definitely play one on <del>TV</del> this blog. So here’s what I’m thinking, design-wise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find all the (self-identified) conservatives on Mechanical Turk</li>
<li>Split them into two groups
<ol>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>control group</strong>
<ol>
<li>Who gets to look at a cute dog</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>and the&nbsp;<strong>experimental group</strong>
<ol>
<li>Who sadly must look at a political ad</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Then we ask them “hey there voter, who are you voting for?”</li>
<li>Compare the groups and see which (if any) of your ads worked</li>
</ol>
<p>Basic science, right?<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_8');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_8">[8]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_8">It’s also (I think?) the basic strategy used by Civis Analytics, based on this <a href="https://medium.com/civis-analytics/with-message-testing-popularity-does-not-equal-persuasiveness-2da200ecc3a8">extremely vague Medium article</a> I read.</span></span> It’s not quite double-blind (most subjects are <em>aware</em> that they’re looking at a pro-Biden ad) but as social science experiments go it’s not bad.</p>
</div><div><h3>What’s the point of all this?</h3></div><div><p>I used to think that all political ads had a single goal:&nbsp;<em>convincing people on the other team to vote for your team.</em></p>
<p>But it turns out these “persuasion” ads don’t really work. A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3042867">2017 review</a> of 40 field experiments concluded that “the best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidates choices in general elections is zero.” So why run ads at all?</p>
<p>Well persuasion ads are only one type of political ad. The full list is</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mobilization ads,</strong> which encourage people on your team to get off their asses and vote</li>
<li><strong>Demobilization ads,</strong> which encourage people on the <em>other</em> team to stay home</li>
<li><strong>Persuasion ads,</strong> which convince independent voters that they should vote for you team</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, changing minds is hard, but convincing people to (1) get off or (2) stay on the couch is relatively easy.</p>
<p>Mobilization ads are pretty common. The phonebanking that I so desperately tried to avoid was&nbsp;<em>entirely</em> about mobilization—we only called “lean left” voters and made sure they knew how to get to their polling place. You may have also heard this called “Get out the vote,” “GOTV,” or even “Get off your festering, bedridden ass and do your civic duty.”<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_9');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_9">[9]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_9">Depending on how many consecutive hours of phonebanking I’ve done.</span></span> This tends to work pretty well, since one-third of Americans don’t vote in general elections.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_10');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_10">[10]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_10">Although the 2020 election did have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/">record turnout</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>A quick perusal of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library">Facebook Ad Library</a> tells me that both sides have the mobilization part covered. That means <em>mobilization</em> is saturated and <em>persuasion</em> doesn’t work—which leaves the dark art of <em>demobilization:&nbsp;</em><strong>how can I best convince conservatives to <em>not</em> vote for Trump?</strong></p>
</div><div><p>I’m not Don Draper, but since I have two eyeballs and an internet connection I see roughly 8,156 ads every second—I should be able to&nbsp;<em>make</em> the damn things, right?</p>
<p>Well okay here’s what I came up with:</p>
</div></div></div><div id="the-ads"><div><div><p>The ads compared in this study. Click to enlarge.</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>I wanted to try positive&nbsp;<em>and</em> negative ads, and I wanted to try a few different issues. Can already guess which ads worked?</p>
</div><div><p>Anyway, after displaying one of these ads to a Turker<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_11');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_11">[11]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_11">I’m told this isn’t as pejorative as it sounds.</span></span> I ask them two questions. The first question shouldn’t surprise you:</p>

</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>In addition to this question, I also asked an <a href="https://www.cloudresearch.com/resources/blog/attention-check-questions-in-surveys-examples/"><strong>attention-check question</strong></a> (ACQ). The ACQ varied for each treatment group, but it looked something like this:</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><span><img width="1460" height="356" alt="Screenshot of attention check question" title="attention-check" src="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM.png" srcset="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-200x49.png 200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-400x98.png 400w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-600x146.png 600w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-800x195.png 800w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM-1200x293.png 1200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-23-at-5.06.19-PM.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1200px"></span></div><div><p>One of my attention-check questions (ACQs).</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><p>Basically, Turkers are incentivized to complete as many tasks as possible in the shortest amount of time. I’m not saying that Turkers are <em>intentionally</em> filling out random answers to surveys, but I&nbsp;<em>am</em> saying that the incentives aren’t great. To combat the inattentive Turker I’ve added this second question, which asks Turkers something painfully obvious about the ad I’ve just showed them.<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_12');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_12">[12]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_12">After I ran this study I found some evidence that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2020/02/18/two-common-checks-fail-to-catch-most-bogus-cases/">open-ended questions make&nbsp;<em>much</em> better ACQs</a>—something to try next time!</span></span></p>
<p>I threw out 1% of the responses because they got this question wrong.</p>
</div><div><p>I don’t want any schmuck with an internet connection to fill out this survey. There are&nbsp;<em>rules</em>, you know? My respondents should</p>
<ul>
<li>Be conservative (I’m studying the demobilization of&nbsp;<em>conservatives</em>)</li>
<li>Live in the US<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_13');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_13">[13]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_13">Well okay I want them to be eligible to vote in US federal elections but “location” is a good enough proxy.</span></span></li>
<li>Not have filled out another survey in this study</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway Mechanical Turk makes enforcing these rules pretty easy via&nbsp;<em>Worker Qualifications</em>:</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div><span><img width="1730" height="730" alt="Screenshot of Worker Qualifications" title="worker-qualifications" src="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-7.41.33-AM.png" srcset="https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-7.41.33-AM-200x84.png 200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-7.41.33-AM-400x169.png 400w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-7.41.33-AM-600x253.png 600w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-7.41.33-AM-800x338.png 800w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-7.41.33-AM-1200x506.png 1200w, https://anthemlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2021-01-24-at-7.41.33-AM.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 1200px"></span></div><div><p>The Worker Qualifications™️ for my experiment.</p>
</div></div></div><div><div><div id="worker-qualifications">
<p>Easy, right? But before you start piling on qualifications like Yogurtland toppings, let me remind you that many of these are “premium” qualifications and cost an arm and leg. If you don’t want to be one of those schmucks that <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a53666/best-frozen-yogurt-toppings-for-your-money/">wastes money on fruit at Yogurtland</a>, <strong>consider asking your own screening questions.</strong></p>
<p>The downside of asking your own screening questions is that you’ll have to throw out all the answers from people who don’t meet your criteria. But depending on the cost of the qualification and the estimated percentage of people who will pass the screening question, it might make financial sense to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Ready to be dazzled by some complicated math? Here’s the cost of using your own screening questions<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_14');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_14">[14]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_14">Assuming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a></span></span>:</p>
<p>\[\text{requirement cost} = \frac{1-p}{p}c\]</p>
<p>Where \(p\) is the estimated proportion of Turkers that will pass your qualification, and \(c\) is the total cost for each completed HIT. In my case each task cost $0.46 ($0.33 for Turkers and $0.13 for Amazon), and according to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2158244016636433">2016 study</a> of the Mechanical Turk population is roughly 14.6% capital-R Republican<span><a onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor_1_2('footnote_plugin_reference_1_2_15');"><sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1_2_15">[15]</sup></a><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1_2_15">Wild, right?</span></span>, so the “roll-your-own” screening method would cost</p>
<p>\[\text{requirement cost} = \frac{1-0.146}{0.146}0.46 = $2.69\]</p>
<p>Which is&nbsp;<em>far</em> more than <a href="https://requester.mturk.com/pricing">the $0.40 that Amazon charges</a> for the “US Political Affiliation” premium qualification—so that’s what I used.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div>
<div>
<p>They called him the Black Sparrow, and from the beginning of his life, all he wanted to do was get to France.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He was born in Georgia, his father a former slave from Haiti, his mother full-blooded Creek. He ran away while still a child, determined to fulfill his destiny.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He lived for a time with a group of English Romani, learning the art of horsemanship and working as a jockey. He kept traveling and working until he made his way to Norfolk, where he stowed away on a ship bound for Scotland.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He wouldn’t see America again for thirty years.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>In Glasgow he got work as a lookout for gambling operators, saving money until he had enough to get to England: one country closer to his goal. In Liverpool he did hard labor until his muscles developed and he turned to boxing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He became part of a whole expat community of Black boxers — some of the finest fighters in history — who had fled to Europe to find opportunities denied them in the States. Soon he was fighting regularly as a welterweight, racking up an impressive record, even fighting on the undercard of a few Jack Johnson bouts.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>His boxing career earned him a decent amount of money, and eventually took him to Paris, where he won his bout and promptly hopped off the tour.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Imagine, if you will, being a young, handsome Black/Creek man, son of a slave, escaped from the American South, newly arrived in Paris in the springtime with your own apartment and a pocketful of money.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Fighting for France was a no-brainer. After all, in his heart at least, it was his country. He joined the French Foreign Legion, training to fight in the 3rd Marching Division alongside wealthy Ivy Leaguers, mariners, farmers, doctors, executives, refugees, cooks, and plenty of characters from all over the world running from undisclosed situations. These were Belgians, Italians, Russians, Greeks, Americans, a handful of Black Americans; Muslims, Catholics, Jews and Protestants — the legendary rabble of the Legion.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Sent directly to the front along the Somme, he was thrust into a world of filthy, bloody trenches still filled with the body parts of the dead and the rancid smell of shit and blood as his unit experienced some of the worst losses of the war.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>At the end of this stint, what was left of the 3rd was disbanded and he had only the briefest respite before he joined the 170th Cavalry and was sent straight to Verdun to participate in what would become one of the worst battles in the history of the human race.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now a corporal, he led a machine-gun crew and again was front-and-center for the worst of the fighting, suffering first a shrapnel wound to the face that he simply fought through, then finally sidelined by a massive, nearly fatal wound to his thigh that finally sent him away from the front.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Decorated with the Croix de Guerre for his valor at Verdun — one of France’s highest military honors — he was well within his rights to find a desk job in the military.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He had other ideas. He wanted to fly.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Already viewed as a hero, he was able to pull the necessary strings to enter flight school, and became the first Black American fighter pilot in history.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew a SPAD VII C1 with a distinctive alteration to its appearance. Painted on the outside of the fuselage was a red heart with a dagger through it. Above the heart was his personal slogan, one he would later use for the title of his unpublished memoir: Tout Le Sang Qui Coule Est Rouge; roughly, in English: “All Blood Runs Red.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He flew with honor and distinction until his career in the air came to an abrupt halt. The Americans had entered the war and the involvement of a certain Dr. Gros, a US Army Major with racist attitudes, led to the end of the Black Sparrow’s career as a pilot.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But the French continued to celebrate him. He ended this part of his military career with the Military Medal, Croix de Guerre, Volunteer Combat Cross, Medal for Military Wounded (twice), World War I Medal, Victory Medal, Voluntary Enlistment Medal, Battle of Verdun Medal, Battle of Somme Medal, and the American Volunteer with the French Army Medal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And that is when his life got interesting.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>The Great War over, he found himself in Paris in the 1920s at the onset of the Jazz Age. He got back in shape, took work as a sparring partner and fought a few more times. But it wasn’t sustainable with his injuries.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So he learned to play the drums and became a jazz musician. He gigged frequently, saved money, and ended up in a business partnership with a biracial American blues singer whose birth name was Ada Beatrice Queen Victoria Louis Virginia Smith — known as “Bricktop” for her red hair.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Together, they opened the Le Grand Duc, and thus he became proprietor of the hippest nightclub in the hippest city during the birth of hip.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He got married around this time to a Frenchwoman named Marcelle and they had two daughters. For reasons that remained private, Marcelle ended up leaving him with their children, to whom he would remain devoted for the rest of his life, as we will see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But he had to balance the duties of being a single parent with Le Grand Duc — and later his other club, L’escradille, which was connected to a boxing gym so that patrons could party, then exercise, take a steam bath, get a massage, and start partying again.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To name the personages that frequented his clubs is basically to list the greatest names in art and culture in the renaissance that was the 1920s.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Langston Hughes was a busboy and dishwasher. Arthur Wilson — you may know him as “Sam” of Casablanca fame — was part of the house band. Charlie Chaplin was a favorite. Gloria Swanson. Fatty Arbuckle. The Prince of Wales. Staff would move tables when Fred and Adele Astaire came in to tear up the floor. Picasso would stop by, and Hemingway was there often enough that he wrote about it in “The Sun Also Rises.” Josephine Baker could not be missed, and even babysat for the Sparrow. F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda were frequent, notorious guests. Cole Porter would come in; he adored the way Bricktop interpreted his songs. When Louis Armstrong encamped in Paris, he and the Sparrow became close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But the good times couldn’t last. In 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. In France, the Deuxième Bureau was created as a counter-intelligence service and the Sparrow was recruited to work with the beautiful Alsatian spy, Cleopatre “Kitty” Terrier, whose father’s murder by Germans in the disputed border region had instilled in her a lifelong hatred of German expansionism.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Kitty and the Sparrow worked as a team at the club. He would serve tables and play dumb, exploiting German prejudices that would never suspect he was fluent in German. She would flirt her way into privileged information. It was a highly successful (and probably romantic) pairing, but with rationing, blackouts, and other wartime austerity measures, keeping businesses running became harder and harder.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>He tried. He procured a wagon and would visit markets at the end of the day for discounted goods, throw them in a stew at the club. Come evening he would feed everyone for free, plus a free glass of wine per person and a pack of cigarettes per table. He tried. But of course, things got worse.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He pulled his daughters out of their convent school to keep them close. Closed the club. Many were fleeing as the Nazis came storming through Belgium. He wouldn’t run.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He continued to work with Kitty in the Resistance until 1940, when the Nazis marched down Champs-Élysées and through L’arc de Triomphe.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Tens of thousands fled the city only to be bombed from the skies. He left his daughters in the care of Kitty, who promised to do what was necessary to keep them safe, packed his gear, and headed for the frontlines, determined, despite his age and multiple injuries, to find his old unit and rejoin the Legion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he arrived, it was only to find that his unit had been destroyed. Returning to Paris, he couldn’t enter; it had been completely overrun.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>But he heard rumors that the French 51st was holding out at Orléans. He started off on foot. The roads were full of starved, half-mad refugees. Bombings were frequent.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When he got there he discovered that his lieutenant from the last war was the commander of the 51st, and, in what must have felt like the world’s worst case of déjà vu, he was once again in charge of a machine-gun crew, fighting the Germans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He fought with his usual bravery. But it was a hopeless last stand. A shell that killed 11 men threw him forty feet and cracked a vertebrae.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>His fighting days were over. Using his rifle as a crutch, he struck out for a military hospital in Angoulême, trying to stay out of sight.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But there was little they could do for him there: painkillers, some bandages, and a few cans of sardines with a suggestion to head for Bordeaux and into Spain which, although Fascist, had maintained official neutrality, and was tacitly allowing Allied rescue efforts on Spanish soil.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>He made it, somehow, received his first passport, and was put on a Navy ship to finally return to the United States he had fled decades before.</p>

<p>Life in Manhattan wasn’t easy. He had to start from scratch. He worked odd jobs — longshoreman, salesman of French perfume. Through a contact in the State Department he was able to get in touch with Kitty, who was true to her word: his daughters were safe. They came to the States without a word of English between them and moved in with their beloved father in Spanish Harlem.</p>

<h2 id="Marc%20on%202021-02-03">Marc on 2021-02-03</h2>

<p>I firmly believe the Internet, and what it stood for, peaked with RSS. </p>

<p>RSS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">Really-Simple-Syndication</a>, is (or <em>was</em> depending on your viewpoint) a means of allowing basically anything online to be collated into a single feed. You would visit the websites you loved, add their RSS feed to your preferred reader, and from then on be instantly notified of any new content, it was as simple as that. RSS primarily had its heyday during the Web 2.0 era (circa 1999-2010) when the freedom to do whatever you wanted with the information present on the Web was really the driving force behind a lot of new features and systems. This was of course before Social Media had taken off in the way we know it today and most of these concepts were siloed off into their own locked-down social-feeds.</p>

<p>Once Social-Media took its hold on the Web if there was something/someone you wanted to follow online you just added them to your Twitter feed or subscribed on YouTube; a fine idea until you decide you don't like the layout of the site in question or an algorithm decides you don't need to see the work of those you care about as often as you want (aka the <em>curated</em> timeline). I've already spoken before about my <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/mastodon.html">general disinterest with Social Media</a> but it wasn't until somewhat recently that I decided to really start looking for alternatives - searching for a better way to interact with the Internet. I found my answer in RSS. I enjoyed the freedom to see sources as I wanted, the flexibility to move to a new reader if I wanted, the complete lack of advertising. It was hard to not fall in love with the service.</p>

<p>However it wasn't until I began working from home and everything in my life moved online that I really began to notice how beneficial RSS could be with relation to Digital Wellbeing. By selecting only the sites, blogs, creators etc. that I had a serious interest in, I could effectively remove the negative effects of social media and excessive online usage from my life. It was easier to get involved in serious <a href="https://atthis.link/blog/2020/deepwork.html">Deep Work</a> as I had no social feeds to endlessly scroll through. It was easier to stay informed as I could only see the <em>latest</em> items rather than being given an algorithmic infinite feed of supposedly “breaking news.” I could open my reader maybe twice a day, skim through the latest items and continue on with my work, a process that could be over and done with in under 5 minutes - a far cry from opening Twitter and suddenly 2 hours have passed…</p>

<p>Another use-case I was surprised to develop was managing collaborative projects. An issue I've heard repeatedly from those working from home is that of being deafened by the ever-present, ever-ringing notification-bell as countless chat and collaboration apps incessantly vie for your attention with new questions, comments, and discussions that may-or-may-not need your already splintered focus. For me, RSS solved that issue. Instead of checking-in every 10 minutes to see if there's any new project developments, or sending chaser messages asking if a colleague finished up on that feature - I can just track everything with RSS. If anything comes up that I need to know about, RSS will be there to present it to me.</p>

<p>As I said during the introduction of this post, RSS may appear to some to have fallen by the wayside as content is increasingly siloed into only being available on a specific platform. However a not insignificant number of sites still make the service readily available, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/rss">Reddit still offers RSS support</a> by appending <code>/.rss</code> to the end of a given URL.</p></li>
<li><p>GitHub allows you to add an activity feed of your followed accounts/organisations by clicking the feed icon at the bottom of your account page.</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube offers RSS support by adding a channel ID (The series of numbers and characters present in the URL of a channel homepage) to the following URL:</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=CHANNEL_ID
</code></pre>

<p>Having only the content I want to see only be shown when I want to see it with the freedom to jump between readers as I please, all with no ads? For me, no other service comes close to the flexibility, robustness, and overall ease-of-use that RSS offers.</p>

<p>Its heyday may be over but RSS is still very much alive with services like <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a> and <a href="https://newsboat.org/">Newsboat</a> (recommended) along with a host of mobile apps on either platform letting you experience the web at what I consider to be its best. If you feel like trying out RSS for yourself, why not get started by adding <a href="https://atthis.link/rss.xml">this blog</a> to your reader?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>You can’t hold a gun to someone’s head and say “Be Creative.”</strong> -Mike Booth, creator of Left4Dead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best PM’s don’t come up with creative ideas and strategy all the time. They create space for creative thinking and optimize their process.</p>
<p>It feels like the stars have to align. The right environment, the right mood, the right spark of inspiration. Now throw a global pandemic on top of that where everyone is working from their bedrooms (or at least I am). There are constant distractions, more meetings than ever, and my typical tools like whiteboards and walking 1:1’s are out the window.</p>
<p>You can call it ‘in the zone’ or ‘flow state’ or ‘creative mode’ but whatever it was... I wasn’t hitting it.</p>
<p>Last month, I found myself sitting around for hours unable to focus and make any progress on strategy or vision.</p>
<p><strong>I was really struggling.</strong></p>
<p>Since then, I’ve started to crack a formula to enter creative mode. It hasn’t been a single epiphany or a magic incantation, but rather a series of behavior changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Schedule</strong></h2>
<p>Creative thinking takes time. You can’t just flip your brain into creative mode instantly. On a good day, it takes about 15 minutes for me to enter creative mode. On a bad day, it can take hours. <strong>If you’re always in meetings with 30 minute chunks in between, you’ll never make any progress.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, we want to optimize for large, uninterrupted focus blocks. Think of The Matrix. When Keanu is interrupted IRL, everything in his brain falls apart. Your brain works the same way. You have to boot the entire project up in your brain, hold it there, and manipulate it.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/unlock-creative-strategic-thinking/soul.jpg">
<p>In the movie Soul, flow is an alternate plane of existence.</p>
<p><strong>Select days for creative thinking</strong> - If you aren’t intentional, meetings will crowd your time and create sprawl all over your calendar. Select at least two days where you optimize your schedule for creative thinking. This will allow you to remember (and have a rationale) to defend those days. I like to setup my calendar as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday - 1:1’s</li>
<li>Tuesday - Team Meetings</li>
<li>Wednesday/Thursday - Creative Mode</li>
<li>Friday - Left open for Ad-hoc meetings</li>
</ul>
<p>If I’m working on a large strategy project, I’ll block off 4+ days per week to ensure I can make plenty of progress. If you take this approach, make sure you align your manager and have their support. Otherwise, you risk getting dinged for not collaborating.</p>
<p><strong>Batch meetings</strong> - Most days end up looking like swiss cheese - Lots of sproadic meetings with 30m-1hr in between. Squeeze your schedule so that the meetings all line up one after another. Paul Graham calls this ‘manager time’. Manager time is when we review and we discuss vs. when we create.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking  up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going  to be broken up, I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning.</em>” (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">see: Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s schedule</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going from meeting to meeting is draining, but those tiny blocks in between are useless and you’ll never make any meaningful creative progress. Batch your meetings so you have large blocks of uninterrupted time for creative thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid context switching</strong> - Just like it takes time to switch into creative mode, it takes time to switch context between projects. If you’re working on multiple products or projects, designate specific days to work on each one. It takes me at least 2-3 hours to switch context from one project to another. If you want to make significant creative progress in a single day, you have to be very intentional (and typically use tactics like a long walk or lunch in between to clear your head). I typically will work on one project on Wednesday and another on Thursday to minimize switching.</p>
<p><strong>Let your teammates know</strong> - Now that you’ve rearranged your schedule, you need to publicize it so others respect it. Providing this context will set clear boundaries and make sure people understand the importance of focus.</p>
<ol>
<li>Align your manager to your schedule. Your manager will need to support you and help you defend your time.</li>
<li>Share your schedule in a team meeting or small group conversation. This will help socialize why you’re blocking off this time (which will increase the chance people will respect it) and give them a chance to give feedback or adjust your schedule.</li>
<li>Write a post/email with your schedule. Make it clear that you’re available outside of your focus blocks and will get back to messages quickly after each block is completed. Bonus points if you set this up as an auto-responder during your focus blocks.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>The right environment can make the difference between a session of fidgeting and one of deep focus. To take advantage of your focus blocks, you need to design your environment for creative mode. Eventually, your brain will start to recognize this place and will shift rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a separate space for creative thinking</strong> - This should be different than your typical work space. You want to avoid your brain switching into ‘task’ or ‘execution’ mode. If you normally work standing, try sitting in a chair. If you normally work in your office, shift to another room (if you have one!)</p>
<p><strong>Setup the space for creativity</strong> - You want your space to fade away. It should be calming, well lit, and comfortable. Not ‘lay down in bed and fall asleep’ comfortable, but enough that you can zone out from distractions around you and not think about adjusting your position. I like to let outside light in and add a few small touches such as a poster (<a href="https://romero.com/shop/p/armedcoders-rrdwf">here's mine 🤓</a>) or a special lamp that inspires you. If possible, avoid spaces with other people in them as their movement will distract you.</p>
<p><strong>Walk or move before you start</strong> - If possible, walk or move before you start. This could be a walk around the block or walking across your house to another room. Movement enables us to think more creatively and problem solve. I knew that Steve Jobs liked walking meetings, but there’s science to back it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Creative thinking improves while a person is walking and shortly thereafter ... The study found that walking indoors or outdoors similarly boosted creative inspiration. The act of walking itself, and not the environment, was the main factor."</em> (<a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2014/04/24/walking-vs-sitting-042414/">Stanford Graduate School of Education</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve started using walking as a tool to start and end sessions. If I’m stuck, taking a walk (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6sdWYXB8RQ">riding my surf skate</a>) can help unblock me.</p>
<p><strong>Create playlists with noise cancelling headphones</strong> - This has been the most impactful change to my routine. Music seem sto help me enter creative mode very quickly. I have a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RQ366VK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07RQ366VK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=bdickason-20&amp;linkId=29ec5297cca7ec448acba6f3bced2c8a">Jabra Elite 85h</a> in beige because I like the feel over ear headphones and they never have issues connecting to my devices. Whenever I sit down for creative time, I have a specific playlist that I put on and listen to on repeat. It’s repetitive, has few words, and the volume is pretty constant. I have a similar playlist for execution/tasks. <strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5pHtl20zTPi6rk6Flo1En9?si=_lyBpvl0RWWC4uJV8u1DEQ">Creative Playlist</a> / <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7KWYiMbxzJH8WqPvdEf3mg?si=e6L2NoY7QFWKPoxJsoiH7w">Execution Playlist</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Remove every distraction</strong> - PM’s pride themselves in being available, but even the vibration from your phone can pull you out of creative mode. Turn everything off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Close apps and tabs</li>
<li>If possible, turn off wifi</li>
<li>Turn on Do Not Disturb on your laptop</li>
<li>Use a minimalist writing app with focus mode like <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a></li>
<li>Put your phone on airplane mode (ideally in a different room)</li>
</ul>
<p>These may sound silly or extreme, but every little bit helps.</p>
<h2>Make it easy to start</h2>
<p>Ok, you’ve got your calendar dialed and you’re in your magic rocket ship creativity chair. Great. Now you pull out a blank page and.... Crap. You’re stuck.</p>
<p><strong>Never start with a blank page</strong> - A blank page can be intimidating and challenging. A good note taking system can shortcut this and make sure you always have a starting point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Everybody’s got an eye for something. The only difference is that I carry around a notebook in my front pocket. I write everything down, and it helps me recall.”</em> (<a href="https://perell.com/essay/how-to-cure-writers-block/">David Sedaris via David Perell</a>)*.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the week, jot down notes about your topic. These could be words that come to mind, short phrases or links, or even an entire outline. The key is to take ideas as they come to you (vs when you sit down to work) and plant tiny seeds of ideas on paper (or in your note taking app). They don’t have to be fully formed, they just need to give you a starting point when you sit down so you’re not starting from scratch.</p>
<p>I take notes using <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> on my phone or desktop. You might choose an app or pen and paper. The important part is that you write them down and remember them when the time comes.</p>
<img src="https://bdickason.com/static/posts/unlock-creative-strategic-thinking/post-outline.png">
<p>Here’s an example of my starting point for this post.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to start at the beginning</strong> - My best strategy work happens when I start in the middle. Creative thinking is unstructured by nature and you want to let your creative faucet flow. Trying to force yourself to follow a structure will only cause you to get stuck on a specific section. <em>“Start writing wherever you can start.</em> <em>Start writing wherever you feel comfortable”</em> (<a href="https://www.dailywritingtips.com/break-writers-block-dont-begin-at-the-beginning/">Daily Writing Tips</a>).</p>
<p>Think of creative mode like a fitted sheet, you put one corner on, then the other, then go back and adjust the first corner. If words come to you, write them down. If two thoughts seem linked, write both and draw a line to connect them. Let the ideas flow in any order they come. Over time, your brain will connect them.</p>
<p><strong>Leave yourself breadcrumbs -</strong> Remember, each time you enter creative mode, your brain has to boot up your whole project in your head. You can help your future self by leaving notes about what you plan to do next. “<em>Unfortunately, most writers get right in their cars and drive away. But the great ones capture the view.”</em> (<a href="https://perell.com/note/leave-a-summary-for-yourself/">Leave a Summary for Yourself by David Perell</a>) This could be a short outline at the top of the document or notes peppered throughout. Keep track of what ideas you were excited about so you don’t have to analyze the entire strategy or vision. For example, for this post I left …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Around Christmas, the React team introduced <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React Server Components</a>. It’s a complete surprise for the React ecosystem as React has always focused on the client-side with a small focus on server-side rendering. Server-side rendering can, for instance, be accomplished using Next.js. </p><p>However, with React Server Components (RSC), it’s now possible to write server-rendered code using React only. Note that RSC is not a final feature as of now. Currently, React Server Components are undergoing beta-testing.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn the following concepts about React Server Components:</p><ol><li>What is a React Server Component?</li><li>Why do we need React Server Components? What problems do they solve?</li><li>What does a React Server Component look like, and what are the benefits?</li><li>What’s the difference between React Server Components and Server Side Rendering (SSR)?</li><li>Is there any future for React Server Components?</li></ol><h2 id="what-is-a-react-server-component">What is a React Server Component?</h2><p>Let’s make this clear first: React always renders React Server Components on the server. It allows frontend developers to create components that span both server and client. </p><p>Why is this useful? This property allows developers to quickly fetch data from external sources Therefore, you don’t have to send an expensive request from your client to your database (for example) to fetch data. As you render your components on the server that also hosts your backend, you can make a local call to your API to fetch data. In other words, locally fetched data is super fast (cheap).</p><p>To summarize, React Server Components allow you to access the speed of fetching data on the server-side while maintaining its rich interactivity of client-side apps. That’s a fantastic improvement for the React ecosystem to build faster applications.</p><h2 id="why-do-we-need-react-server-components">Why do we need React Server Components?</h2><p>UI development needs to offer the following properties:</p><ol><li>It should offer a good user experience</li><li>It should be cheap to maintain</li><li>It should offer fast performance</li></ol><p>However, these properties are at odds with each other. To illustrate this problem with the current state of React, let’s imagine a Spotify artist page that has the following components.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>ArtistPage</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> artistID </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span> </span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArtistDetails</span><span> artistId</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>artistId</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>TopTracks</span><span> artistId</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>artistId</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Discography</span><span> artistId</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>artistId</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>ArtistDetails</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>Now, let’s fetch all data at the top of the component and pass each component’s required data.

We expect the API call to return artist details, top tracks, and discography. If we want to change the component’s behavior in the future, we might need to change the behavior of the API endpoint as well. </p><p>Further, if we remove a component inside the <code>&lt;ArtistDetail/&gt;</code> component, we might forget to remove this data from the API call. Therefore, this approach affects code maintenance. But don’t worry, there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach. It’s how React works.</p><p>What if we allow each component to fetch its data to decouple the API response from the component? Our code might look like this.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>ArtistDetails</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> artistId</span><span>,</span><span> children </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> artistData </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fetchDetails</span><span>(</span><span>artistId</span><span>)</span><span>'</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>TopTracks</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> artistId </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> topTracks </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fetchTopTracks</span><span>(</span><span>artistId</span><span>)</span><span>'</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>Discography</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> artistId </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> discography </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>fetchDiscography</span><span>(</span><span>artistId</span><span>)</span><span>'</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>While this code is much easier to maintain, it creates performance issues. If you remember our initial component, we’ll get a cascade of API calls that wait for each other to finish. </p><p>In other words, the <code>&lt;ArtistDetails/&gt;</code> component fetches data, then <code>&lt;TopTracks/&gt;</code> fetches its data, and finally, the <code>&lt;Discography/&gt;</code> component starts fetching the required data. They also call this a network waterfall.</p><p>Our previous example used a single API call to fetch all data to increase performance.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>ArtistPage</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> artistID </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span> </span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>ArtistDetails</span><span> artistId</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>artistId</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>TopTracks</span><span> artistId</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>artistId</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Discography</span><span> artistId</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>artistId</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>ArtistDetails</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  </span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div><p>So, can we come up with a solution that addresses all three properties in the React ecosystem: good UX, cheap maintenance, and fast performance?

React won’t include a dependency that you use only in a React Server Component in the bundle size. Therefore, the user won’t have to download this dependency. The RSC will use this dependency on the server to render the required output and send this output to the client. Cool, right?</p><h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-react-server-components-and-server-side-rendering-ssr">What’s the difference between React Server Components and Server Side Rendering (SSR)?</h2><p>Server-side rendering focuses on reducing the initial page load. When using SSR, you send HTML to the client. The client then loads all of the React JavaScript you need to make your web page interactive. In other words, you have a traditional React app after the initial page load when React injects all JavaScript. </p><p>The most significant difference is that your components are still client-side components. All required dependencies are still downloaded. The only difference when using SSR is that your initial page load contains only HTML to improve performance.</p><h2 id="is-there-any-future-for-react-server-components">Is there any future for React Server Components?</h2><p>There’s a massive potential for React Server Components as they address many tradeoffs React developers experience. Some of the most important benefits include:</p><ul><li>Fast data fetching locally on a server</li><li>Server-side dynamic logic</li><li>Ability to include any dependency for RSCs without having to worry about increasing the cost to load a web page</li></ul><p>On the other hand, many React users might get confused at first by this domain switch. React has shown a strong focus on the client-side in the past. React Server Components suddenly span both server and client. This change requires a significant shift in the way we think about React components. </p><p>For that reason, I expect React developers to embrace this approach but also to see many people struggle to grasp this concept and make correct decisions about server/client-side components.</p><p>If you want to play around with the demo code for React Server Components, you can find this code on <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="monitor-bad-and-slow-requests-in-production">Monitor bad and slow requests in production</h2><p>While RSC will let you work seemlessly with back-end and front-end requests, debugging data fetching requests and responses in production may be challenging and time consuming.

Yet, it presents a risk that is growing with the increase of AI adoption rate.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll go over the main concepts to understand this subject:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why</strong> do we need to care about the security of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> are the vulnerabilities of ML systems ?</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> can we secure ML Systems ?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why should we care ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning models are more and more integrated in sensitive decision-making systems such as autonomous vehicles, health diagnosis, credit scoring, recruitment, etc. Some models can be trained on personal data like private emails, photos and messages from social media.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are complex software components and can be compromised. Vulnerable systems can lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data extraction:</strong> the exposure of sensitive information or specific details included in the data used for training the models.</li>
<li><strong>Model extraction:</strong> copying a model by stealing the internal parameters and hyperparameters.</li>
<li><strong>Model tricking:</strong> fooling the model by manipulating the inputs, leading to erroneous decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Model corruption:</strong> methods that perturb the inner functioning of the model to generate corrupted outputs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the threats ?</h2>
<p>Here is a list of some vulnerabilities from which ML models suffer, this is a non-exhaustive list:</p>

<h3>Data extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unintended Memorization</strong></p>
<p>Deep learning models and in particular generative models suffer from unintended memorization<sup>1</sup>, they can memorize rare details from the training data. Using only inferences from the model, it is possible to extract sensitive information from the training dataset.</p>
<p>This method was used to extract credit card details and social security numbers from Gmail’s Smart Compose feature that helps you to write emails faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Membership Inference</strong></p>
<p>Using this technique an attacker can infer whether a new data record is included in the training dataset or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model extraction</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Stealing</strong></p>
<p>Using these methods and by querying models (with predictions APIs), it is possible to extract an equivalent ML model. These attacks are successful against a wide variety of model types: logistic regressions, decision trees, SVMs and deep neural networks.</p>
<p>A set of model extraction attacks were used to steal model types and parameters from public machine learning services such as BigML and Amazon Machine Learning in 2016 <sup>2</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model tricking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial attacks</strong></p>
<p>Adversarial attack is maybe one of the most known attacks on deep neural networks since it has been widely mediatized. It works by providing deceptive input at inference time. It’s a powerful method because the noise added to the input can be imperceptible and it does not depend on the architecture of the attacked model.</p>
<p>In the following example <sup>3</sup>, the model is tricked to classify the image as “guacamole”.</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model corruption</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Poisoning</strong></p>
<p>Training data often include information harvested by automated scrapers or from unverified sources on the web, this is a vulnerability that can be exploited to tamper with models.</p>
<p>For example, data poisoning was used to generate undetectable spam messages <sup>4</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backdoor attacks</strong></p>
<p>These methods work by injecting a trojan in the training data or in a pre-trained model that is activated by a trigger at inference time to make the model output a specific result. It is model-agnostic.</p>
<p>In this example the trigger is a small square patch or sticker that is used to flip the identification of the stop sign <sup>5</sup>.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/e4d4fe15e70c5eead257a7a80b110c3d/04c57/backdoor.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="Backdoor attack: green square patch on stop sign" title="Backdoor attack: green square patch on stop sign" src="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/e4d4fe15e70c5eead257a7a80b110c3d/04c57/backdoor.png" srcset="https://sahbichaieb.com/static/e4d4fe15e70c5eead257a7a80b110c3d/12f09/backdoor.png 148w,

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attacks on Transfer Learning</strong></p>
<p>If a pre-trained model is corrupted with data poisoning or a backdoor attack, it is likely that a new model that is trained using the corrupted model as a starting point will be corrupted as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Federated Learning</strong>, considering its distributed nature, can be even more exposed to Model corruption through training data manipulation as we can assume that an ML hacker has a full control of part of the training samples and labels. Federated learning can also be subject to data extraction attacks through the leakage of gradients shared between the workers and/or the server <sup>6</sup>.</p>
<h2>How can we secure models ?</h2>
<p>Machine Learning security is an active research area, and since we are dealing with computer systems we cannot have a 100% secure system. Some of the defense mechanisms that exist are only experimentally validated, so we have to be aware that they can be broken.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Differential Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Differential Privacy can be used against data extraction attacks. The aim of this technique, applied during the training of the model, is to approach similar outputs when the training is done with the sensitive data or without it. It tries to ensures that the model does not rely too much on individual samples <sup>1</sup>. In practice, that comes at the expense of accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Homomorphic encryption</strong></p>
<p>Homomorphic encryption is an encryption method that enables computations on encrypted data directly. It ensures that the decrypted result is the same as if the computation had been done on unencrypted inputs. In a simplified way, for an encryption function <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{E}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>

<p>It is one of the defense mechanisms used in Federated learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Randomization methods</strong></p>
<p>The goal of these techniques is to protect Deep Neural Networks models against perturbations by adding randomness to test points and using the fact that Deep Neural Networks are robust to random perturbations. A random input transformation can help mitigate adversarial effects. Random smoothing technique is used to perturb backdoor attack triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Input Preprocessing</strong></p>
<p>Input preprocessing can be used against backdoor attacks or adversarial attacks, by modifying the model input during training or testing. Autoencoders can be used to clean the input. An imperfect reconstruction can make the model unable to recognize triggers <sup>7</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adversarial training</strong></p>
<p>In this method, we train the model by adding adversarial samples in the training data to improve its robustness against adversarial attacks <sup>8</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Machine Learning systems are complex software systems where software code and data are interlaced, so they do not only face computer security risks but also data threats. Data Scientists and ML Engineers need to be aware of these risks when they design their Machine Learning systems.</p>

There are many of these ...if you have a moment, take your pick! Some
of these would make good projects, or would be a way your organization
could contribute to the building of the web.<p>
There are also special lists of little things to do for each existing
project such as the <a name="1" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Defaults/Bugs.html">line mode browser</a> , the <a name="2" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/NeXT/Implementation/Bugs.html">NeXT browser</a> , the common<a name="5" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Library/Bugs.html">
library</a> , and the <a name="3" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Bugs.html">server</a> .
</p><h2>Client side</h2>
<dl>
<dt>More clients
</dt><dd> Clients exist for many platforms, but not all. Editors
only exist on the NeXT, but will be really useful for sourcing info
and group work. (Group editor?)
</dd><dt>Search engines
</dt><dd> Now the web of data and indexes exists, some really
smart intelligent algorithms ("knowbots?") could run on it.  Recursive
index and link tracing, Just think...
</dd><dt>Text from hypertext
</dt><dd> We need a quick way to print a book from the web.
(A simple method using TeX exists)
</dd></dl>

<h2>Server side</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Server upgrade
</dt><dd> Easier to install, port.  Export directories as hypertext.
Run shell scripts embedded in the directory for virtual documents
and searches.
</dd><dt>More Servers
</dt><dd> See the <a name="4" href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/Overview.html">list</a> of things we have thought of or been pointed
to.
</dd><dt>WAIS integration
</dt><dd> WAIS protocol extensions to allow hypertext; HTML
data type, docids to be conforming UDIs. Integrate WAIS in client
too.
</dd><dt>Integrate client and server
</dt><dd> A client which generates HTML becomes
a general purpose gateway. Especially useful for sites where general
access to news, external internet, etc, is limited.
</dd></dl>

<h2>Other software</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Gateways
</dt><dd> JANET and DECnet for example. Real need.
</dd><dt>HTTP enhancements
</dt><dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
information for statistics.
</dd><dt>Mail manager
</dt><dd> A hypertext view of a mail archive with lists of messages
by author, topic, with links between messages. A friendly face on
a mail archive would be a great project management tool.
</dd><dt>HTTP enhancements
</dt><dd> Format conversion, authorization, better logging
information for statistics.
</dd><dt>Form processing
</dt><dd> If you can edit hypertext, you edit a hypertext form
and return it.   To be able to submit a form back to the server would
allow  special search patterns, administrative processing, electronic
voting, ...
</dd><dt>Graphic overview
</dt><dd> Display the web from any document in a graphical
form.
</dd></dl>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Tutorials
</dt><dd> Hypertext leading a new or prospective user through W3.
</dd><dt>Canned demos
</dt><dd> A hypertext path through some good represenattive places
to visit. Maybe a script to make a timed presentation (with sound?).
</dd><dt> Videos
</dt><dd> Would save us giving so many talks!
</dd><dt>Policy documents
</dt><dd>Statements on NIR: collect from institutes, provide
background for organizations making NIR policy decisions.
</dd></dl>

<p>Calculating prime numbers in a range is another comparison in programming languages. In this article, we compared the speed of codes to find Prime Number functions in C++ and Python</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Prime numbers are an interesting area to research. A&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>prime number</strong></a>, it is also called&nbsp;<strong>prime</strong>&nbsp;shortly, is a natural number (a positive integer) greater than one that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. If a number is not prime then it is called a&nbsp;<strong>composed number</strong>. There are several mathematical questions regarding prime numbers that are still unsolved. Finding them and relations and their effects on some other functions, graphics really interesting in mathematical phenomena.</p>
<p>In the programming world today,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python</a>&nbsp;is very popular and easy to use. It makes popular because of supports from big companies (i.e. Google) and its successful libraries and frameworks on AI Technology. It is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared with C/C++, Delphi, Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme, or Java. Python has very clear syntax and it has some practical things. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high-level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for other applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use. Python is free to use and more information can be found from their official web page&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.python.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.python.org/</a></p>
<p>C and C++ are the fastest and one of the most powerful programming languages and it is easy to calculate prime numbers as fast as possible. In these tests we will use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">C++ Builder</a>&nbsp;which has a great IDE, includes compilers for Win32, Win64, Android, and iOS. C++Builder has both CLANG Enhanced C/C++ Compiler and Embarcadero’s new Bcc C/C++ Compiler. It also features a modern, high-productivity RAD Studio IDE, debugger tools, and enterprise connectivity to accelerate cross-platform UI development. You can develop GUI based applications easily, as it comes with the award-winning VCL framework for high-performance native Windows apps and the powerful FireMonkey (FMX) framework for cross-platform UIs. There is a free C++ Builder Community Edition that can be used by students, beginners, and startups with limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the free C++ Builder Community Edition here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter</a>. Professional developers can use the Professional, Architect, or Enterprise versions of C++ Builder. Please visit&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder</a>.</p>
<p>Python can be used inside Delphi projects and this prime number function is tested before in Delphi and in Python here&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM" data-rel="lightbox-video-0" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCz5h96ObUM</a>&nbsp;with Kiriakos Vlahos. Here, we were inspired by this video and we try to do the same tests on the same function in C++. Finding Prime Numbers in C++ is explained in detailed well in this&nbsp;<strong>Easily Learn To Find Prime Numbers In Modern C++</strong>&nbsp;post&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/easily-learn-to-find-prime-numbers-in-modern-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, we compared the speed of Prime Number functions in C++ Builder 10.4 and Python 3.9.1.</p>

<p>In these counting prime numbers tests we also found that Python 3.9.1 version looks faster than 3.7.9 version which comes with current Spyder editor. It is obvious that 64bits test doubles 32bits test in speed.</p>
<p>We also tested counting prime numbers with same procedures in C++ Builder with system information in <a href="https://learncplusplus.org/interesting-c-builder-compiler-counting-prime-number-benchmarks/">our post here</a> before. Here are some of results.</p>

<p>These tables above show that calculating the number of prime numbers in 32bits takes 0.494 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 8.770 seconds In this test, in comparison C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>17.8 times faster in 32bits</strong>&nbsp;and calculating number of prime numbers in 64bits takes 0.350 seconds in C++ Builder (including with Modern FMX GUIs) and Python 3.9.1 is doing the same operation in 3.298 seconds that means C++ Builder is&nbsp;<strong>9.4 times faster in 64bits</strong>. Note that we made the same tests before with&nbsp;<strong>GNUC/C++</strong>&nbsp;on the same system and we post it&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/quickly-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-gnu-c-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/learn-to-count-prime-numbers-in-visual-studio-code-c/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>VSCode</strong>&nbsp;before, and we did the same tests on the latest Dev-C++ and results can be found&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://learncplusplus.org/dev-c-tutorial-easily-learn-to-count-prime-numbers-on-windows/" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, on the same PC System, our tests show that C++ ( C++ Builder BCC &amp; CLANG, GNU C/C++, Dev C++, VS Code) is about 9.4 times faster than Python on counting prime numbers in 64 bits and about 17.8 times faster in 32 bits. The calculating number of prime numbers is good to use some basic logical operations and mathematical functions. The procedure includes logical if() clauses, for() loops, some mathematical procedures (floor, sqrt etc.), that show C++ is very fast in mathematical operations. These kinds of tests can be done in different operations to compare languages.</p>
<p>Note that all tests were done on a single core/thread test. C++ Builder is capable to do Threads and easy to use Parallel algorithms for multi-thread operations. It shows that threaded tests are much faster, depends on the number of cores/threads.</p>
<p>Actually, results were obvious because of Python is an interpreted programming language with some benefits while C/C++ is a non-interpreted (compiled) programing language. Here C++ proofs that still it is very fast to do mathematical operations in comparison with Python. These kinds of tests can be done on many mathematical operations and on other codes. Speed changes may improve analyzes and other operations (i.e face detection, image processing, or other AI technologies). If your applications are built with C++ they will have faster operations in each task. On the other side, Python has some advantages in coding, easy to code, well on AI technologies with some TensorFlow, Keras frameworks. Users should define their priorities before coding an application and they should choose their programming language for their projects.</p>
<p>Please keep following our next posts on these tests.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Today we're releasing Hazelcast Jet 4.4 and we have some exciting new
features!</p>
<h2>Jet SQL</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet 4.4 brings you the first beta version of our SQL
interface. You can now log into Jet from the command line and issue
queries against the data sources you specify. They can be both data at
rest (<em>batch</em> sources) and live feeds (<em>streaming</em> sources).</p>
<p>If you have Docker at hand, here's something you can try out right now!
(For examples that don't require Docker, go to the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/intro">docs</a>.)</p>
<pre><code>docker pull hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
docker network create jet-network
docker run --name jet --network jet-network -v <span>"<span>$(pwd)</span>"</span>:/csv-dir --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-jet
</code></pre>
<p>Wait for a message like this in the output:</p>
<pre><code>2021-01-15 17:50:18,645 [ INFO] [main] [c.h.c.LifecycleService]:
    [172.17.0.2]:5701 is STARTED
</code></pre>
<p>Now start another terminal window and enter the SQL shell:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run --network jet-network -it --rm hazelcast/hazelcast-jet jet --targets jet sql
Connected to Hazelcast Jet 4.4 at [172.17.0.2]:5701 (+0 more)
Type 'help' for instructions
sql〉
</code></pre>
<p>You are now ready to write some SQL. Try these:</p>
<pre><code>sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_series(<span>1</span>,<span>3</span>));
+
|           v|
+
|           1|
|           2|
|           3|
+
3 row(s) selected
sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> <span>key</span>, <span>sum</span>(<span>key</span>) <span>as</span> total <span>FROM</span> (
          <span>SELECT</span> v/<span>2</span> <span>as</span> <span>key</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_series(<span>0</span>, <span>7</span>))
      ) <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>key</span>;
+
|                 key|               total|
+
|                   0|                   0|
|                   1|                   2|
|                   2|                   4|
|                   3|                   6|
+
4 row(s) selected
</code></pre>
<p>Here are two more examples with streaming SQL. Streaming queries never
complete, so use <code>Ctrl+C</code> to cancel them after a while:</p>
<pre><code>sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_stream(<span>10</span>));
+
|                   v|
+
|                   0|
|                   1|
|                   2|
^C
Query cancelled.
sql〉 <span>SELECT</span> * <span>FROM</span> <span>TABLE</span>(generate_stream(<span>100</span>)) <span>WHERE</span> v / <span>10</span> * <span>10</span> = v;
+
|                   v|
+
|                   0|
|                  10|
|                  20|
^C
Query cancelled.
sql〉
</code></pre>
<p>For more examples with CSV files, Kafka and IMap, go to the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/sql/intro">docs</a>.</p>
<p>We're currently very focused on bringing more features to our SQL, so
stay tuned!</p>
<h2>File Connector</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/api/sources-sinks">Unified File Connector API</a> gives you a
simple way to read files, unified across different storage systems.
Using the same API you can read files from the local filesystem, Hadoop
FS, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. At the same
time, the connector supports a variety of encoding formats: text files,
CSV, JSON, Avro, etc., equally for all storage systems.</p>
<p>Here's how the Java syntax looks:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You specify the storage system type with the URI schema, for example to
access S3:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"s3a://bucket-id/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And this is how you tell it to use the Avro encoding:</p>
<pre><code><span>BatchSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>FileSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>files</span><span>(</span><span>"s3a://bucket-id/path/to/my/directory"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>FileFormat</span><span>.</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>User</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>avro</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Kinesis Connector</h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/">Amazon Kinesis Data
Streams</a> (KDS) is a
durable, scalable real-time data streaming service native to the AWS
environment, and fully managed by it. You can use it as both a source
and a sink in a Hazelcast Jet pipeline:</p>
<pre><code><span>StreamSource</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Map<span>.</span>Entry</span><span>&lt;</span><span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span> source <span>=</span> <span>KinesisSources</span>

</code></pre>

<h2>Enforce Strict Event Order</h2>
<p>Hazelcast Jet's primary focus is to leverage all opportunities to
improve the throughput and latency of its computation. One example is
using logic that isn't sensitive to the exact event order. Jet can use
this freedom to optimally load-balance the data across parallel tasks.
This works great for stateless transforms like <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> as
well as aggregate operations specifically written in terms of
commutative and associative functions. However, Jet also supports
transforms such as <code>mapStateful</code>, where reordering any two events is
likely to result in different output.</p>
<p>In version 4.4 we provide a new option,
<code>pipeline.setPreserveOrder(true)</code>, which tells Jet to disable the
dataflow optimizations that result in reordered events. One consequence
of enabling it is that the level of parallelism in the source stage
determines the parallelism of all the subsequent stages because the data
flows in parallel lanes through the pipeline. So if you have a source
that isn't paralellized, your whole pipeline won't be parallelized
either (at least until a stage that explicitly changes the order, such
as <code>rebalance</code> or <code>groupingKey</code>). This feature works best when you have
a partitioned source and you only require strict order among events with
the same key. Then you get both the ordering you need and decent
parallelization.</p>
<h2>Improved Packaging</h2>
<p>We used to offer Jet packaged with some hand-picked extensions while you
could add others by downloading them separately. As of 4.4 we offer two
kinds: a full package with all the extensions, and a slim one with none.
Normally you want to use the full package, but if you want to optimize
the download size or disk usage, use the slim package.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, we now provide a slim Docker image,
<code>hazelcast/hazelcast-jet:4.4-slim</code>, to serve as the base image in your
Dockerfile that combines it with the extensions, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span> hazelcast-jet:<span>4.4</span>-slim
<span>ARG</span> JET_HOME=/opt/hazelcast-jet
<span>ARG</span> REPO_URL=https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/hazelcast/jet
<span>ADD</span><span> <span>$REPO_URL</span>/hazelcast-jet-kafka/4.4/hazelcast-jet-kafka-4.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar <span>$JET_HOME</span>/lib/</span>

</code></pre>
<p>See the
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/operations/docker#build-a-custom-image-from-the-slim-image">instructions</a>
in our docs for more details.</p>

<li>@hhromic</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your valuable contributions!</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[sql] SQL Beta: submit jobs to Jet from the command-line SQL shell.
(#2595, #2636, #2648, #2654, #2665, #2729, #2763, #2788)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-api] [017] Unified API to create sources and sinks from
file-like resources: local filesystem, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage
and Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage (#2518)</p></li>
<li><p>[kinesis] [018] Amazon Kinesis connector (#2656)</p></li>
<li><p>[pipeline-api] [016] Prevent event reordering: by default Jet reorders
data for performance, now you can disable this to get strict event
order where you need it.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[connectors] @hhromic improved the naming of source and sink stages
across different connectors, bringing them all in line with the same
convention <code>xSource</code> / <code>xSink</code> (#2685)</p></li>
<li><p>[pipeline-api] @TomaszGaweda added the <code>pipeline.isEmpty()</code> method
that tells whether it contains any stage (#2659)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] @TomaszGaweda added the
<code>jet.imdg.version.mismatch.check.disabled</code> config property that
disables the enforcement of the exact IMDG dependency version. This
allows adding IMDG quick fixes to the existing Jet release. (#2610)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] New packaging: download either the full package with all the
extensions enabled, or the minimal package and separately download the
extensions you want. (#2796)</p></li>
<li><p>[cli] Improved the behavior of <code>jet submit</code>: now it waits for the job
to start and prints a message about it. (#2699)</p></li>
<li><p>[python] Improved the error message when using a Python function but
Python is not installed. (#2672)</p></li>
<li><p>[kafka] Improved the performance of the Kafka source by fine-tuning
some timeouts. (#2732)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>[core] Fixed a problem where Jet would close <code>System.out</code> during JVM
shutdown, preventing shutdown hooks from printing to stdout. (#2649)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-connector] Fixed the blocking File connector declaring its
processors as cooperative, resulting in performance loss. (#2628)</p></li>
<li><p>[file-connector] Several bug fixes in the File connector. (#2772)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] Fixed a leak caused by Jet's ephemeral loggers created for each
job. They didn't get released from internal maps in the logging
framework. (#2737)</p></li>
<li><p>[core] Fixed two problems with the <code>peek</code> transform. (#2740, #2765)</p></li>
<li><p>[hadoop] Fixed a problem when using Hadoop for local files, it behaved
as if the files were shared. (#2764)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
<p>None.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>An article about the new <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.fastmath.29"><code>@fastmath</code></a> and <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#Traits"><code>__traits(target*)</code></a> features in LDC 1.1.0. The <code>@fastmath</code> attribute relaxes floating point math constraints and is used by <a href="https://github.com/libmir/mir">Mir</a> to <a href="http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html">beat OpenBLAS and Eigen</a>.</em><br>
<em>To avoid confusion: <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> is doing the interesting work, LDC just adds a few pieces that allow LLVM to work its magic.</em><br>
<em>I’m afraid it won’t be a nice read if you are unfamiliar with some of peculiarities of the CPU’s <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/floating_point/understanding_floating_point_representation.html">floating point</a> math, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">x86 assembly</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a>.</em></p>



<p>The available SIMD parallelism in the CPU is very powerful: with the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/avx-512-instructions">AVX512 instruction set</a>, the CPU packs 16 (!) 32-bit floats in one register and can do a SIMD multiplication-addition twice (!) per clock cycle. So programming for performance boils down to writing your code such that the compiler can generate code that maximally exploits SIMD.<br>
Two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilya-yaroshenko-46464993">Ilya Yaroshenko</a> wrote the article <a href="http://blog.mir.dlang.io/glas/benchmark/openblas/2016/09/23/glas-gemm-benchmark.html">“Numeric age for D: Mir GLAS is faster than OpenBLAS and Eigen”</a>. The article presents performance benchmarks of his linear algebra additions to <a href="https://github.com/libmir/mir">Mir</a>, a generic numerical library written in D, demonstrating that his D code is fast and beats well-known assembly language implementations of the same functionality.<br>
For very high performance, common implementations of basic math primitive functions are written in assembly language explicitly instead of trusting the compiler to generate equally fast machine code. In contrast, Ilya writes: “Mir GLAS (Generic Linear Algebra Subprograms) has a single generic kernel for all CPU targets, all floating point types, and all complex types. It is written completely in D, without any assembler blocks.” That’s quite an achievement: carefully optimized D code that performs as fast as carefully optimized assembly code. In this article I’ll present a few (simple) additions to LDC that enable LLVM’s magical optimizer to generate such fast assembly code for Ilya’s amazing D code.</p>



<p>I’ll show assembly code snippets generated by LDC using <code>-c -output-s</code>. LDC version 1.1.0-beta2 or newer is needed. You can use the online compiler at <a href="http://ldc.acomirei.ru/">ldc.acomirei.ru</a> to look at the assembly code that LDC generates yourself, for the examples given here and for your own D code.<br>
<em>If you find that the generated assembly for your D code could be improved, submit an <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/issues">LDC issue</a> on Github, <a href="https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc/issues/1438">like Ilya did</a>!</em></p>



<p>The CPU’s floating point math is not the same as algebraic math, because of approximation errors due to the finite storage available for a floating point number after each calculation. The calculation <code>a + (b + c)</code> may or may not be equal to <code>(a + b) + c</code>, and <code>(a + a) - a</code> may or may not be equal to <code>a</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply.E2.80.93add">fused multiply-add (FMA)</a>, <code>a * b + c</code> is not the same as, well…, <code>a * b + c</code>. This often prevents optimization of math code, unless the programmer tells the compiler that, really, it’s all the same to him.<br>
Let’s look at a basic math function and see how we can improve the compiler-generated machine code.</p>



<p>The following code calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a> of two vectors of arbitrary length:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>double</span> <span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>foreach</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>s</span> <span>+=</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The algebraic equation for the dot product is</p>

<p>s = (a1 * b1) + (a2 * b2) + (a3 * b3) + …</p>

<p>but because of the inaccuracies of floating-point math, the D code calculation must be described as:</p>

<p>s = ((((0 + a1 * b1) + a2 * b2) + a3 * b3) + … )</p>

<p>The parens are important: they signify the order of operations, <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5380">absolutely critical</a> for the outcome. From this equation, we can see that the multiplications can be done in any order and in parallel, but that the additions must be done sequentially and in a very specific order.</p>

<p>Let’s see what assembly code LDC 1.1.0 generates (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language#Syntax">AT&amp;T dialect</a>). I’ll only show the meat of the dot function, in this case the 4-fold-unrolled inner loop:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>LBB0_4:
  movsd (%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  mulsd (%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  addsd %xmm0, %xmm1
  movsd 8(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  mulsd 8(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  addsd %xmm1, %xmm0
  movsd 16(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  mulsd 16(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  addsd %xmm0, %xmm1
  movsd 24(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  mulsd 24(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  addsd %xmm1, %xmm0
  addq  $4, %rdi
  cmpq  %rdi, %rdx
  jne LBB0_4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>No vectorization: it’s just sequential multiply-add-multiply-add-multiply-add-…</p>

<p>But wait, I forgot to tell the compiler that my CPU is newer than the default <code>core2</code> CPU (nota bene, at least on OS X, by default LDC compiles your code for a 10-year-old processor). In this case it doesn’t matter much:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=haswell</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
  vmovsd  24(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm2
  vmulsd  24(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm2, %xmm2
  vaddsd  %xmm1, %xmm0, %xmm0
  vmovsd  32(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  vmulsd  32(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1, %xmm1
  vaddsd  %xmm2, %xmm0, %xmm0
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don’t be fooled by the “v” seemingly implying “vector”. Those multiply and add instructions are mere <em>single</em> double-precision operations. The loop is unrolled 8-fold, and that’s all that changed. Without relaxing some constraints on the mathematics, it’s the best possible.</p>



<p>One performance improvement is to allow the compiler to ‘fuse’ <code>a*b+c</code> into one instruction <code>fma(a,b,c)</code>. It will change the outcome of the calculation, but for many use-cases it won’t matter. Note: the result using FMA is <em>not</em> necessarily worse than before (it may well be more accurate), it’s just <em>different</em> and that’s why the compiler can’t use FMA per default.</p>

<p>We can instruct LLVM to allow “unsafe-fp-math” transformations such as FMA using the LDC attribute <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.llvmAttr.28.22key.22.2C_.22value.22.29.29"><code>@llvmAttr("unsafe-fp-math", "true")</code></a> (you’re not recommended to use this low-level attribute, please read on).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>ldc</span><span>.</span><span>attributes</span> <span>:</span> <span>llvmAttr</span><span>;</span>
<span>@llvmAttr</span><span>(</span><span>"unsafe-fp-math"</span><span>,</span> <span>"true"</span><span>)</span>

        <span>s</span> <span>+=</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=haswell</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>...
  vmovsd  (%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm1
  vfmadd132sd (%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm0, %xmm1
  vmovsd  8(%rcx,%rdi,8), %xmm0
  vfmadd132sd 8(%rsi,%rdi,8), %xmm1, %xmm0
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>LLVM replaced the multiply and add instructions with non-vectorized fused multiply-add instructions, clearly a win. But the code is still not using the vectorized instruction set of the CPU.</p>



<p>For vectorization of our code, there is one last piece missing: telling LLVM that it’s OK to do whatever it wants with our floating point operations: e.g. the code does not have to support NaN or infinity, and it can change the order (!) of the add operations in our dot product. LLVM’s <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags">Fast Math Flags</a> are used for this, and you can apply this to all floating point operations in a function using the (low-level, not recommended) LDC attribute <code>@llvmFastMathFlag</code>. We combined <code>@llvmAttr</code> and <code>@llvmFastMathFlag</code> into the <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#.40.28ldc.attributes.fastmath.29"><code>@fastmath</code></a> attribute.</p>

<p>I recommend the usage of <code>@fastmath</code> instead of the other two low-level attributes; it is much more resilient against LLVM changes. The burder is on LDC to make <code>@fastmath</code> work with whatever attributes LLVM will require in the future.</p>

<p>With <code>@fastmath</code> the result becomes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>ldc</span><span>.</span><span>attributes</span> <span>:</span> <span>fastmath</span><span>;</span>
<span>@fastmath</span>
<span>double</span> <span>dot</span><span>(</span><span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>double</span><span>[]</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>s</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>foreach</span> <span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span> <span>0</span> <span>..</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>s</span> <span>+=</span> <span>a</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>b</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>s</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=haswell</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>LBB0_6:
  vmovupd (%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm4
  vmovupd 32(%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm5
  vmovupd 64(%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm6
  vmovupd 96(%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm7
  vfmadd132pd (%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm0, %ymm4
  vfmadd132pd 32(%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm1, %ymm5
  vfmadd132pd 64(%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm2, %ymm6
  vfmadd132pd 96(%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm3, %ymm7
  vmovupd 128(%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm0
  vmovupd 160(%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm1
  vmovupd 192(%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm2
  vmovupd 224(%rsi,%rdi,8), %ymm3
  vfmadd132pd 128(%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm4, %ymm0
  vfmadd132pd 160(%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm5, %ymm1
  vfmadd132pd 192(%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm6, %ymm2
  vfmadd132pd 224(%rcx,%rdi,8), %ymm7, %ymm3
  addq  $32, %rdi
  addq  $2, %rax
  jne LBB0_6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We now have a nicely vectorized dot-product function: the <code>vfmadd132pd</code> instruction performs a vectorized fused multiply-add operation, in this case it’s the equivalent of 4 non-vectorized operations. Each loop iteration processes 32 vector elements.</p>



<p>In the examples above, the D code did not specify the target architecture: all vectorization happens automatically. All credit must go to LLVM’s amazing backend that is able to analyze and optimize the code so well. So when you’d be compiling for a new processor with wider SIMD registers, all you’d have to do is recompile for that CPU and the D code would become even faster:<br>
<code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mcpu=knl</code> results in <code>vfmadd231pd  (%rcx,%rdi,8), %zmm4, %zmm0</code> instructions that process 8 vector elements at a time (“knl” stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeon_Phi#Knights_Landing">Intel’s Knights Landing</a>).<br>
If your target is an ARM processor with <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/technologies/neon.php">NEON SIMD tech</a>, you’ll automatically get vectorized FMA code too:</p>

<p><code>ldc2 -c -output-s -O3 -release dot.d -mtriple=aarch64-none-linux-gnu -mattr=+neon</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>.LBB0_5:
  ldp q2, q3, [x9, #-16]
  ldp q4, q5, [x10, #-16]
  add x9, x9, #32
  add x10, x10, #32
  sub x11, x11, #4
  fmla  v0.2d, v4.2d, v2.2d
  fmla  v1.2d, v5.2d, v3.2d
  cbnz  x11, .LBB0_5
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The dot-product example above is a very simple function. For more complex algorithms, you can get better performance if you take the sizes of the CPU’s caches into account; the characteristics of the instruction and data caches are both important for performance tuning.</p>

<p>LDC 1.1.0 has <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC-specific_language_changes#Traits">two special <code>__traits</code></a> that give compile-time information about the compile target architecture: <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "...")</code> and <code>__traits(targetCPU)</code>. For example, <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "avx2")</code> returns true or false depending on whether the compile target supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX2</a> instructions or not.</p>

<p>Mir uses <code>__traits(targetHasFeature, "...")</code> to decide what vector types (say, a vector of 4 or 8 floats) to use in its algorithms, but I don’t know the exact how-and-why (yet? Ilya fill us in on …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Indiana University, Fall 2020</p>

<p>High-level programming languages like Racket make it easier to program
relative to low-level languages such as x86 assembly code. But how do
high-level languages work? There’s a big gap between Racket and
machine instructions for modern computers. In this class you learn how
to translate Racket programs (a dialect of Scheme) all the way to x86
assembly language.</p>

<p>Traditionally, compiler courses teach one phase of the compiler at a
time, such as parsing, semantic analysis, and register allocation. The
problem with that approach is it is difficult to understand how the
whole compiler fits together and why each phase is designed the way it
is. Instead, each week we implement a successively larger subset of
the Racket language. The very first subset is a tiny language of
integer arithmetic, and by the time we are done the language includes
first-class functions.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> B521 or C311. Fluency in Racket is highly recommended
as students will do a lot of programming in Racket. Prior knowledge of
an assembly language helps, but is not required.</p>

<p><strong>Textbook:</strong> The notes for the course are available
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktdw8j0adcc44r0/book.pdf?dl=1">here</a>. If
you have suggestions for improvement, please either send an email to
Jeremy or, even better, make edits to a branch of the book and perform
a pull request. The book is at the following location on github:</p>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>

<p>Course grades are based on the following items. For the weighting, see
the Canvas panel on the right-hand side of this web page.  Grading
will take into account any technology problems that arrise, i.e., you
won’t fail the class because your internet went out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assignments</li>
  <li>Quizzes</li>
  <li>Midterm Exam (October 23, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
  <li>Final Exam (December 15, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>

<p>Organize into teams of 2-4 students. Assignments will be due bi-weekly
on Mondays at 11:59pm. Teams that include one or more graduate
students are required to complete the challenge exercises.</p>

<p>Assignment descriptions are posted on Canvas.
Turn in your assignments by creating a github repository and giving
access to Jeremy (jsiek) and Caner (cderici).</p>

<p>Assignments will be graded based on how many test cases they succeed on.
Partial credit will be given for each “pass” of the compiler.
Some of the tests are in the public support code (see Resources below)
and the rest of the tests will be made available on Sunday night, one
day prior to the due date. The testing will be done on the linux
machine kj.luddy.indiana.edu named
after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson">Katherine
Johnson</a> of NASA
fame. The testing will include both new tests and all of the tests
from prior assignments.</p>

<p>You may request feedback on your assignments prior to the due date.
Just commit your work to github and send us email.</p>

<p>Students are responsible for understanding the entire assignment and
all of the code that their team produces. The midterm and final exam
are designed to test a student’s understanding of the assignments.</p>

<p>Students are free to discuss and get help on the assignments from
anyone or anywhere. When posting questions on Piazza, it is OK to post
your code.</p>

<p>In contrast, for quizzes and exams, students are asked to work
alone. The quizzes and exams are closed book.  We will be using
Respondus Monitor for online proctoring.</p>

<p>The Final Project is due Dec. 4 and may be turned in late up to
Dec. 11.</p>

<p><strong>Late assignment policy:</strong> Assignments may be turned in up to one
week late with a penalty of 10%.</p>

<p><strong>Bias-Based Incident Reporting.</strong></p>

<p>Bias-based incident reports can be made by students, faculty and
staff. Any act of discrimination or harassment based on race,
ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender, gender identity, sexual
orientation or disability can be reported through any of the options:</p>

<p>1) email biasincident@indiana.edu or incident@indiana.edu;</p>

<p>2) call the Dean of Students Office at (812) 855-8188 or</p>

<p>3) use the IU mobile App (m.iu.edu). Reports can be made anonymously.</p>

<p><strong>Dean on Call.</strong></p>

<p>The Dean of Students office provides support for students dealing with
serious or emergency situations after 5 p.m. in which an immediate
response is needed and which cannot wait until the next business
day. Faculty or staff who are concerned about a student’s welfare
should feel free to call the Dean on Call at (812) 856-7774. This
number is not to be given to students or families but is for internal
campus use only. If someone is in immediate danger or experiencing an
emergency, call 911.</p>

<p><strong>Boost.</strong></p>

<p>Indiana University has developed an award-winning smartphone app to
help students stay on top of their schoolwork in Canvas. The app is
called “Boost,” it is available for free to all IU students, and it
integrates with Canvas to provide reminders about deadlines and other
helpful notifications. For more information, see
https://kb.iu.edu/d/atud.</p>

        <p><img alt="Taiga6 overview" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/taiga6.jpg"></p>
<p>That's right, we, the Taiga team, felt we were at a crossroads. On one hand we had <strong>a stable and sustainable open source business</strong> that could evolve at a steady but calm pace. On the other hand, we felt <strong>we should be doubling down on our agenda</strong> towards a much better agile project management experience. The challenges were many, both technological and product driven. So far, we have tackled just a few of them and <strong>that's exactly what we're presenting today as Taiga6</strong>, our best release <strong>ever</strong> since Taiga 1.0.</p>
<h2><a id="lets-start-with-the-obvious-stuff">Let's start with the obvious stuff</a></h2>

<p>Sure, you might be as excited as us but you need <strong>to see and feel</strong> the new release. We absolutely get it! We've put together an express overview of the major changes that come with Taiga6.</p>
<h3><a id="user-interface-revamp">User Interface revamp</a></h3>

<p>Taiga's user interface has never stopped evolving but it had aged quite a bit. We're not talking just a new theme or some polishing, it's really <strong>more intuitive, slicker and faster than ever</strong>. This is still a work in progress but it's impossible not to notice the improvements. We believe this will be one of those major UI changes that will garner almost <strong>universal positive recognition</strong>.</p>

<h3><a id="swimlanes-on-kanban">Swimlanes on Kanban</a></h3>

<p>Taiga's KANBAN ranks high in flexibility and features. That's probably because we always thought KANBAN was deceptively simple and we made sure you got <strong>all its potential</strong>, not a second-class agile citizen. But... we lacked swimlanes. <strong>Swimlanes allow your team to create independent paths</strong> for your KANBAN cards and enjoy a much more powerful and flexible visual management state of things. Swimlanes can be almost anything you consider to deserve a particular space, from subteams to priorities or miniprojects. Try them out!</p>

<h3><a id="better-use-of-space">Better use of space</a></h3>

<p>Even if our screens get larger and larger and their resolutions dream of becoming 8K, we are quite <em>effective</em> at finding ways to get our digital workspace cluttered. Taiga was always weary of that annoying tendency to put on display as much as possible. What we've done is learn from user feedback, user interactions and most common behaviour pattern <strong>to redesign where things are, when they do appear and how you know they are there</strong>. <em>Lists of items</em> in particular and also <em>zoom levels</em> have been redesigned with your precious cognitive load in mind.</p>

<h3><a id="taiga-resources">Taiga Resources</a></h3>

<p>We had lots of information about Taiga scattered around. We decided to inventory all that was relevant about Taiga and create a <a href="https://resources.taiga.io/">new resources centre</a> for you to be assured that either your information need is satisfied there or it's accessible through it. <strong>Nearly everything has been written again from scratch</strong>, from tutorials, critical articles on agile techniques, community contributions or FAQs.</p>

<h3><a id="new-and-improved-text-editor">New and improved text editor</a></h3>

<p>Our dual HTML/Markdown editor was good enough for some time but it was time to acknowledge the amazing work by the great people at CKEditor. We have tweaked it a bit to address our Right-To-Left needs and also some convenient "stay on top" mode as well as keeping with the good "non-destructive mistakes" habits. Taiga's new editor will try hard <strong>to protect your half-baked changes whether your accidentally</strong> refresh page or click on cancel, hit escape, etc.</p>

</p><figcaption>Just focus on nice content...</figcaption>
<h2><a id="docker-image">Docker image</a></h2>

<p>We have back-pedalled on one of the most sacred long-standing truths here at Taiga; <em>"don't devote resources to an official on-premise/private cloud Taiga image"</em>. <strong>The response from the community was absolutely amazing</strong> providing quite a number of really great Taiga docker images and alternative deployment schemes. Eventually, we decided we should be taking a stance on the hundreds of thousands of private Taiga installations out there and <strong>provide an <a href="https://github.com/taigaio/docker-taiga">official Taiga docker image</a></strong>. Depending on its success and acceptance, we hope to expand to other ways for deploying Taiga.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/taigaio/docker-taiga"><img alt="Taiga6 editor" src="https://blog.taiga.io/images/2021-01-26_whatsnewTaiga6/docker.jpg"></a>

<h2><a id="what-to-expect">What to expect from Taiga in 2021</a></h2>

<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: A lot. <strong>Long answer</strong>: We want to go from the best open source agile project management platform to become one of the best project management platforms out there. We started this journey a few years ago and we are far from done. We want to do comprehensive under-the-hood tech overhaul as well as starting adding new project modules and really innovative features while we make sure to protect the key Taiga differentiators; <strong>ease of use, flexibility and straightforward agile for cross-domain teams</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, <strong>we developed Penpot</strong>, the first open source design and prototyping platform, <a href="https://penpot.app/">check it out</a>!</p>

<p>Welcome to Fluxtion streaming and thanks for coming, hope you enjoy exploring :)</p>

<p>Fluxtion is a java utility that builds embeddable, reactive complex event processors. 
The streaming api uses a functional programming style to define business logic. Write simple clean Java code 
to create real-time applications. All the complex heavy lifting is taken care of by Fluxtion, 
programs are quick to build, test, deploy and debug.</p>

<p>Fluxtion focuses on the processing logic of event streams, independent of messaging system. Areas of good fit include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Embedding real-time processing</strong> within an existing system</li>
  <li><strong>Edge processing</strong> executing on edge devices</li>
  <li><strong>No middleware vendor lock-in</strong> works with any messaging provider</li>
  <li><strong>Low latency</strong> or high performance requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Auditable systems</strong> supports ahead of time compilation</li>
</ul>

<p>Data streams can be merged, filtered, aggregated, joined, grouped and enriched. 
Windowing of data is fully supported. User functions are easily integrated to directly execute actions in addition to real-time monitoring.</p>

<p>A full set of tools for debugging, tracing, auditing and visualisation are provided to reduce development and support costs.</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.wfff.info/mobile-native-vs-cross-platform">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="comp-kknyjvzi" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>Recently I was asked this question and it got me thinking. This article is still an ongoing piece of work so any comments and suggestions are welcome.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>I have worked in the last 10 years as an iOS native developer. I’ve had to manage my own memory in Objective-C with [retain] and [release] and got to work with Swift 5 and Autolayout. I also dipped my toes into Android, React Native, Ionic and have previously worked with C++, .net, J2ME and others.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hence from my experience these are some types of companies that would benefit from doing things all native (iOS, Android or both):&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Companies that already started with native apps a long time before and already have a significant codebase in native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies for whom money is not a problem, but quality and performance is very important. They want the best there is and have no problem paying for that. Usually these are already large companies with a lot of sales and that have an important brand to protect. Ex: Banks, Automotive, Telecoms, Airlines, Electronics etc..</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Companies that require a project that heavily uses some features close to the operating system. Examples: heavy use of video, or graphics, some types of games, fitness trackers or other apps that make constant use of sensors and run in the background. They also need to be the first that take advantage of a new feature in the OS.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Companies that require a large and complex project. If you have a project with a complex UI and with many features. &nbsp;Often these are companies that already have a cross-platform project but it has become so large that it is getting difficult to maintain and might already have performance issues that are causing a bad user experience. They already are paying for a team of developers to maintain the app so there won’t be much of an economy if switching to native.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;5. Companies whose core service is through an app. Examples: Uber, Revolut, etc.. These are companies who cannot risk the app being broken or taken offline because of a change in the framework they are using. Moreover they require the app to work flawlessly, and be so good as to be featured in the AppStore or Google Play. Being in the top 5 apps is almost a requirement. Therefore it’s better to use the native tools that are guaranteed to be supported and that allow for a great user experience.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;6. For startups that need an MVP I would recommend starting with a native app in only one platform Android or iOS, whichever is closer to their potential customers. After you test it in the real world and have gone through several iterations of build+validation and started to have traction and funding, you can now invest in a second app for the other platform, having the advantage that you already have the first. Going native will allow you to iterate faster because the development process is making use of better tools and better support. Otherwise if you would start with a cross-platform solution you will find at some point that it doesn’t scale, or it has become too buggy and unstable to support different UIs (iPhone, iPad, Android, watch etc) from one codebase and that you will be forced to rebuild native anyway.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>What companies would NOT benefit from native app development vs cross-platform apps?</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; 1. Companies that already have a working mobile website and want to reuse a lot of that code then it’s probably better to go cross-platform.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Companies that have a lot of programmers and know-how in a certain technology ( ex: Javascript, Microsoft technologies) and wish to leverage that. If you have many people with experience in .net, you might want to try Xamarin. Likewise if you have many people with experience in React or other Javascript frameworks, you might want to try React Native or Ionic. This still means you occasionally will need to find someone who can work with native but those can be outside consultants and most of the codebase can be maintained by using the know-how inside the company.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. Internal apps that must work on many platforms and UI smoothness and beauty is not a concern, but resources in terms of people and time are.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you need to make an app that you don’t think will be maintained. Examples are apps for conferences or promotional campaigns that will only be used for a period of time and are afterwards useless, apps for conducting studies or surveys.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;If you have an app that should look the same way across all platforms disregarding UI guidelines. Examples: Many games are like that, made in Unity or other frameworks and have their own look and feel which is platform independent.</span></p>

<p><span><span>​</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Frequent issues with cross-platform solutions:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Memory issues when scaling the app.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Animations and “snappiness”. Animations will not be automatically supported and actually more difficult to implement in cross-platform solutions.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Lack of proper tools — Often, there is no debugger and no performance measurement tools.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Uncertainty of whether that platform will still be supported in a few years. There have been cases of cross-platform tools that were either abandoned (Flash) or acquired and then axed (Parse). Even so, generally there seems to be a trend of people liking the newest cross-platform tools</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>A tendency to prefer the "new and trending" tools</span></p>
	</li>
</ul></div><div id="comp-kko39lkc" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/why-i-dont-use-cross-platform-mobile-dev-tools-ac57ddc582b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Too small community. Programmers need other programmers to learn from or use their open-source code. If there aren’t many others then you will be stuck fixing some obscure bug or having to build something from scratch for that particular platform.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>You still need access to native developers. Some parts will still have to be made native and often bugs will have to be fixed in the bridging platform. In RN there is a frequent issue of using open-source libraries that are not maintained or are buggy and some work still needs to be made on the native part to keep them up-to-date.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Many companies that started with cross-platform tools have ultimately abandoned them: Facebook, <span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/17/linkedin-mobile-web-breakup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a></span>, <span><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/sunsetting-react-native-1868ba28e30a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb</a></span>, etc..&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Delayed access to having the latest and greatest of what features the OS can provide. New features released on Android and iOS must be adapted in order to be available using cross-platform libraries. This means there will be an unknown delay between their official release and being able to use them in your code.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Software engineering: why you should keep logic inside model objects]]>

February 3, 2021 | https://pawelpluta.com/tell-dont-ask-learn-to-talk-to-your-objects/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pawelpluta.com/tell-dont-ask-learn-to-talk-to-your-objects/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Modifying data in a class where they reside is always a good thing. The Tell Don’t Ask principle guides us on how to follow such an approach. Unfortunately, it is widespread to obtain data from object and process it inside some service or manager class. After this article, you will know how to talk with objects and process data inside them instead of pulling their logic out of objects. You will be able to test your new skill with kata exercise.</p>



<h3>Benefits of Tell Don’t Ask principle</h3>



<p>At the first glance, obeying the Tell Don’t Ask principle might look like a cosmetic change for the code. In fact, it provides a lot more than just a simpler, less coupled clean code. By following this principle, you will follow OOP with ease by:</p>



<ul><li>The localisation of information — everything related to the object will be kept in one place — its data, ways of modifying it, its flow and ways of processing it</li><li>Limited code duplication, as operations with objects data will be kept in one place. You will not have to keep an eye on DRY principle, as it will be implemented naturally</li><li>Strong <a href="https://pawelpluta.com/the-oop-has-been-explained-wrongly-to-me/">object-oriented approach</a>, with a focus on abstraction</li><li>Simplified unit tests. Instead of preparing heavy service classes to test data processing, most of your code could be tested with lightweight unit tests</li></ul>



<h2>A little bit of theory</h2>



<p>The Tell Don’t Ask is about <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping the data where it belongs</a> – encapsulated inside the object. Encapsulation should prevent us from modifying object internal state without it knowing that. Modifying the object state with setter does not guarantee that, as such the object lacks abstraction. Service classes digging in objects internals are like trying to eat by putting food directly to your stomach, instead of putting the food into your mount.</p>



<p>Sample application used here will simulate a small farm, that has only a few responsibilities. The first task that it will fulfil is to water plants when they need that. The second will be gathering products from the plant, when they are ready, and the last one is to deliver packed products to the customer.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="689" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-1024x689.png" alt="Diagram showing the interaction between service and classes that are violating OOP." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-1024x689.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-300x202.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled-768x517.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Untitled.png 1102w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Sample service managing the data kept inside the objects.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With such an approach, we do not give objects any privacy. Tearing out their internals violates OOP and complicates the service logic. Let’s think how we can refactor it to obey Tell Don’t Ask principle and achieve clean code. Try to find the logic that has been taken out of classes. Spot for the places, where some decision is made. Found it? The first step would be to tell the <code>Plant</code> to water it using some <code>WaterValve</code>, instead of service doing that.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="862" height="602" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored.png" alt="Diagram showing the interaction between service and classes while using Tell Don't Ask Principle." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored.png 862w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored-300x210.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tellDontAskPlantRefactored-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px"><figcaption>Tell don’t ask principle used to refactor code to more object oriented one.</figcaption></figure>



<p>By telling the <code>Plant</code> to water it with some <code>WaterValve</code>, we encapsulated its logic inside the class. We do not need to make condition outside of the <code>Plant</code> class, which simplifies service testing by reducing the number of interactions between objects and possible execution paths. Let’s take a look into the practice.</p>



<h2>Modeling it in code</h2>



<p>Let’s look at the implementation that reflects the first diagram. It is digging deeply into objects internal, fetching plants from <code>RaisedBed</code> and getting internal properties from those plants. If that wasn’t enough, it is implementing plant-related logic, asking the plant for its values and setting new ones, depending on the <code>Plant</code> state. Service has huge knowledge about other object internals.</p>






<p>Sample service implementation that does not follow the Tell Don’t Ask principle.</p>



<p>Apart from asking for internal values, it also differentiates the logic depending on the type. Think a little bit about that, how you are going to test this solution? Are you going to check logic for every type of plant? Will you make different tests depending on plant soil moisture? What if there will be no raised bed or valve? Testing every possible path will require a lot of tests. Or, maybe you will decide risk bugs and not test everything?</p>



<h3>Getting hands dirty</h3>



<p>Consider the same service, but respecting the Tell Don’t Ask principle. Let’s literally tell the raised bed to be watered with some valve, and let it delegate this work to its plants.</p>






<p>Watering service after we applied the Tell Don’t Ask principle into it.</p>



<p>When we applied to Tell Don’t Ask principle, this service simply delegates the request to it. Its only responsibility is to orchestrate invocation and manage the repositories. Testing it will only limit to the integration with repositories, while logic that used to be in it can be checked easily with unit tests. You might struggle, where the logic is now? Take look on a part of refactored <code>RaisedBed</code>.</p>






<p>Again, using Tell Don’t Ask, we are not using the internals of <code>Plant</code> in here – we are only managing specific plant watering, but we let the plant to decide if it needs one. Again, there are not many cases to test in here, so writing unit test should be easy. Next step with this refactoring will be to include the watering logic inside the plant itself. You can consider introducing a Strategy pattern to simplify logic even more.</p>



<h2>Dealing with dependencies</h2>



<p>Sometimes, to perform an action, you will need to call another service. In our application, this is a situation when we sale products. Plants after gathering are organized into crates. Crates can be packed for the customer, and such a package can be sent to it. However, sending a package is managed by another service.</p>






<p>Service with dependent service usage without refactoring.</p>



<p>There are two most common approaches to refactor that into code obeying Tell Don’t Ask principle.</p>



<h3>Service orchestrating invocation</h3>



<p>First discussed approach relays on a service (<code>Sales</code> in this case), that has the knowledge about that when the <code>Package</code> should be sent. <code>Sales</code> service is an orchestrator for the process. In this case, we simply pass the package to delivery service so it will be processed by it.</p>






<p>Service orchestrating invocation of another service.</p>



<p>For most people, it is natural to code this way, so the benefit of this approach is the ease of understanding this solution. On the other hand, it creates a little bit of coupling between <code>Sales</code> service and a <code>Package</code> class – Sales does need to know when packaging was successful, and when it should be delivered.</p>



<h3>Disconnected Domain Model variation</h3>



<p>Disconnected Domain Model is was described in Vernon’s “Implementing Domain-Driven Design” book as a technique of injecting repositories into aggregates. Injecting repositories in every aggregate by constructor may cause problems with dependency injection mechanisms due to a large number of aggregates that should be fed with repository dependency. Instead of that, we might try to pass this dependency directly that need to use some service.</p>






<p><code>packageToDeliver.send()</code> requires <code>DeliveryService</code> to work.</p>



<p>This technique limits the knowledge of <code>Sales</code> service about <code>Package</code> class implementation, so it simplifies testing of a service. It keeps the whole logic related to <code>Package</code> inside class. On the other hand, it usually brings confusion to the developer, who is unfamiliar with it. While using this technique, carefully select services that are injected. Using those services only for invoking processing is usually not a threat, but using a value returned from injected service might lead to <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlagArgument.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flag Argument</a> antipattern.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The Tell Don’t Ask principle promotes keeping logic inside object instead of service. This increases their cohesion, making the code more maintainable and easier to test. Extracting the logic into service makes them unnecessarily big and complex. Try to speak with your objects, and tell them what to do.</p>

<p>Chances are you are reading this blog post using your web browser. Chances also are your web browser has various extensions that provide additional functionality. We usually trust that the extensions installed from official browser stores are safe. But that is not always the case as we recently found.</p>



<p>This blog post brings more technical details on CacheFlow: a threat that we first <a href="https://blog.avast.com/malicious-browser-extensions-avast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> about in December 2020. We described a huge campaign composed of dozens of malicious Chrome and Edge browser extensions with more than three million installations in total. We alerted both Google and Microsoft about the presence of these malicious extensions on their respective extension stores and are happy to announce that both companies have since taken all of them down as of December 18, 2020.</p>



<p>CacheFlow was notable in particular for the way that the malicious extensions would try to hide their command and control traffic in a covert channel using the <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP header of their analytics requests. We believe this is a new technique. In addition, it appears to us that the Google Analytics-style traffic was added not just to hide the malicious commands, but that the extension authors were also interested in the analytics requests themselves. We believe they tried to solve two problems, command and control and getting analytics information, with one solution.</p>



<p>We found that CacheFlow would carry out its attack in the following sequence:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="497" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1024x497.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-300x146.jpg 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-768x373.jpg 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-1536x746.jpg 1536w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CacheFlow-diagram-2048x994.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>High-level overview of the CacheFlow malware</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Based on our telemetry, the top three countries where Avast users downloaded and installed the CacheFlow extensions were Brazil, Ukraine, and France.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="639" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/map_VDF-not-from-tagger_31_2020-11-17_2021-01-31_guid-1024x639.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/map_VDF-not-from-tagger_31_2020-11-17_2021-01-31_guid-1024x639.png 1024w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/map_VDF-not-from-tagger_31_2020-11-17_2021-01-31_guid-300x187.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/map_VDF-not-from-tagger_31_2020-11-17_2021-01-31_guid-768x479.png 768w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/map_VDF-not-from-tagger_31_2020-11-17_2021-01-31_guid-1536x958.png 1536w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/map_VDF-not-from-tagger_31_2020-11-17_2021-01-31_guid-2048x1278.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Distribution of Avast users that installed one of the malicious extensions</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>We initially learned about this campaign by reading a <a href="https://blog.nic.cz/2020/11/19/hledani-skodliveho-kodu-mezi-doplnky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Czech blog post by Edvard Rejthar from CZ.NIC</a>. He discovered that the Chrome extension “Video Downloader for FaceBook™” (ID <code>pfnmibjifkhhblmdmaocfohebdpfppkf</code>) was stealthily loading an obfuscated piece of JavaScript that had nothing to do with the extension’s advertised functionality. Continuing from his findings, we managed to find many other extensions that were doing the same thing. These other extensions offered various legitimate functionality, with many of them being video downloaders for popular social media platforms. After reverse engineering the obfuscated JavaScript, we found that the main malicious payload delivered by these extensions was responsible for malicious browser redirects. Not only that, but the cybercriminals were also collecting quite a lot of data about the users of the malicious extensions, such as all of their search engine queries or information about everything they clicked on.</p>



<p>The extensions exhibited quite a high level of sneakiness by employing many tricks to lower the chances of detection. First of all, they avoided infecting users who were likely to be web developers. They determined this either through the extensions the user had installed or by checking if the user accessed locally-hosted websites. Furthermore, the extensions delayed their malicious activity for at least three days after installation to avoid raising red flags early on. When the malware detected that the browser developer tools were opened, it would immediately deactivate its malicious functionality. CacheFlow also checked every Google search query and if the user was googling for one of the malware’s command and control (C&amp;C) domains, it reported this to its C&amp;C server and could deactivate itself as well.</p>



<p>According to user reviews on the Chrome Web Store, it seems that CacheFlow was active since at least October 2017. All of the stealthiness described above could explain why it stayed undetected for so long.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="913" height="165" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017.png 913w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017-300x54.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/store_review_2017-768x139.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px"><figcaption>User review on the Chrome Web Store from October 2017 that mentions modification of Google search results</figcaption></figure></div>







<h2>The covert channel</h2>



<p>First, we’ll show the hidden backdoor that the extensions used to download and execute arbitrary JavaScript. Specifically, we’ll describe the backdoor from the Chrome extension “Downloader for Instagram” v5.7.3 (ID <code>olkpikmlhoaojbbmmpejnimiglejmboe</code>), but this analysis applies to the other extensions as well, since the malicious code hidden in them is very similar in functionality.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DErNJa7s3X7-EUGOvCPpQEsJkAFH3KdRvBFxQiWH37NiSAKIUFvxmKssQ6m0i5zTskNWTeV8pfeCj7secZzSG2uckKlFTISyB4r1PwuDMYvf5CkgITiXM_V2UR3QYIZsSElCeuDm" alt=""><figcaption>“Downloader for Instagram” page on the Chrome Web Store</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It is generally a good idea to start the analysis of unknown Chrome extensions from the <code>manifest.json</code> file. The manifest of “Downloader for Instagram” gives us some interesting pieces of information.</p>



<p>First of all, the <code>content_security_policy</code> is defined in such a way that it is possible to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#never_use_eval!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous</a> <code>eval</code> function to load additional JavaScript. However, looking for the string <code>eval</code> in the extension’s source code did not yield any interesting results. As we’ll show later, the extension does use the <code>eval</code> function quite a lot, but it hides its usage, so it is not immediately apparent.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/plYZi8H7ohhbAAGn3HoHfsRhaKu0FOSM27Fk6aINue25-LuOKNcgZHVJBIEY8-YtNffVboZryyjaWPgSQqa7HdiL5QBnjdulWfjr30YwBNTzaI8bBoaRSZiFyDpVWMF10DOf6mnI" alt=""><figcaption>Content Security Policy definition from the <code>manifest.json</code> file</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Secondly, the extension asks for quite a lot of permissions and it is not immediately clear why these permissions would be needed to download videos from Instagram. Especially interesting is the <code>management</code> permission, which allows the extension to control other extensions. The combination of the <code>webRequest</code> and the <code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code> permissions is also interesting. Together, these two permissions make it possible for the extension to intercept pretty much any web request coming from the browser.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GXlvV4yTGeWbiZn6q7WjmNOfxq-jQx8pYbqFCwcgLU8Li3I_i8_YQ7C-QXdSMBm03-LaGuk-ZhkVbn15nD0UZ2a7BFYaSdFAIsXPTbGmn4rFZRXpgDn3cyBZBwS8oVq07i6NnetY" alt=""><figcaption>Permissions requested by the malicious extensions</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Finally, the manifest defines two background scripts: <code>js/jquery.js</code> and <code>js/background.js</code>. These scripts are persistent, which means that they will keep running unless the extension gets disabled.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tflzmxXmCyqagTiUbTkHb7DfNI4It30R0hHDVjZh7WeAiV-bl4f6ve33LXphmm84N9kO_epPU1iIhI2S0vE6powG9jB5ufNMJ1ima-gEKgVyZx-_8RbfQyzCXaiPExZqMsDfpO-i" alt=""><figcaption>Background scripts declared in the <code>manifest.json</code> file</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>One of these background scripts, <code>background.js</code>, is where the suspicious <code>webRequest</code> API is used. This script accesses the HTTP response headers of all intercepted web requests and stores their values in localStorage.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kB_RAWUKhE4467ei82a1zl_u6pXyfB5eEtzfXI_kjFMKqXSWGjk9VHbNsndNB-EesAb3yZAUFy7nGr4jQPK3Ok7BTwm9Iih-eGXzFqVV7gBiPxdBb2ZSzNAlxjzFviBWDSJOAht3" alt=""><figcaption>CacheFlow saves the values of all sufficiently long HTTP response headers into localStorage.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The content of localStorage is then read by the other persistent malicious background script: <code>jquery.js</code>. While this script appears at first glance to be the legitimate <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jQuery</a> library, some additional functions were inserted into it. One of those additional functions is misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code>, while all it does is return the <code>window.localStorage</code> object.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TeINLg0HORJ_P0DDJbaEsBs_cz5hA2fDGSSb6orJ76THL7JKjxYj1UOj-Atkn89kjg1Zfmk6tQTL-LzlneXJh4Kj1MizzyCDh66jonO8tMc3EL-sNA3dNyBLmcNTbNEOPxAumWKi" alt=""><figcaption>Misleadingly named <code>parseRelative</code> function hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Another inserted and misleadingly named function is <code>initAjax</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="456" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax.png 1006w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-300x136.png 300w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/initAjax-768x348.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"><figcaption><code>initAjax</code> function decodes the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code> and stores decoded values in the <code>window</code> object.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This function is particularly interested in the content of <code>localStorage['cache-control']</code>, which should at this point be set to the value of the last received <code>Cache-Control</code> HTTP response header. The function splits the content of this header with a comma and attempts to decrypt each part using a custom function named <code>strrevsstr</code>, before finally parsing it out as a JSON string.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/goWFLSGQb0chknR4jrq9RWhhwgku6ms3lXOQy7Ix-n7YM9WsmAzRZ4OonUGJV6Pm6pmt_NHOYeSKEDdyuYt029lAhBsR6fy3VNkgJu0UU25TSAnMZpAAOpmuVfPsRzkfySTLJSI3" alt=""><figcaption><code>strrevsstr</code> function used by the extension to decrypt strings</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The obvious question now is why would the extension expect to intercept requests that contain an encrypted JSON string in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is that the threat actors are using the content of the <code>Cache-Control</code> header as a covert channel to send hidden commands to the malicious extension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a part of the malicious extension’s regular functionality, analytics requests about some events are sent to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. These are standard analytics requests that bear resemblance to Google Analytics. The catch is, that the server used by this extension might respond to the analytics requests with a specially formed <code>Cache-Control</code> header, which the client will decrypt, parse out and execute.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ght_jCWk0nzs16njkDqf6SCrXlE7Va4Y_BLXzs8w8lgJXRnxFDgZa60VirwgiZ421w7dZwBnQAw-jOAvvy8A_PAborsR8hTg5fmWhtTFHK2PVDHWFF58lDRprGqhnYzibiN2FV_4" alt=""><figcaption>Flow of the covert channel</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>To see what the commands could look like, we simulated the extension and sent a fake analytics HTTP request to <code>https://stats.script-protection[.]com/__utm.gif</code>. After a couple of attempts, we received a specially crafted <code>Cache-Control</code> header.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/evazuvvQ91jdK50XsV34gbeOAkRH_vJz6mptWRlJtBgQQbyK-JOEPrAsshMkMLZdHcxZUJORtwLANqhWO1e6W_QLMx1K2e5JNi6rg9zDYr2n7IK_beX5bKLYfJDobQyfe2hy9o7G" alt=""><figcaption>Fiddler capture of a seemingly innocent analytics request that contains a hidden command in the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Note that the response will contain the encoded command only when some conditions are met. First of all, the GET parameter <code>it</code> has to be set at least three days into the past. Since this parameter contains the time when the extension was installed, this effectively ensures that the extension will not exhibit any malicious behavior during the first three days. There is also a check based on the IP address, since we repeatedly did not receive any commands from one source IP address, even though we did receive a command for the same GET request from another IP address. As the logic behind these checks is safely hidden on the C&amp;C server, there might be additional checks that we are not aware of.</p>



<p>When the content of the received <code>Cache-Control</code> header is <a href="https://github.com/avast/ioc/blob/master/CacheFlow/extras/decryptor_strrevsstr.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decoded</a> using the custom <code>strrevsstr</code> function as outlined above, we get the command in the following JSON. As was seen in the <code>initAjax</code> function, all of the attributes from this JSON get stored in the global <code>window</code> object.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="642" height="134" src="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1.png 642w, https://decoded.avast.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/json_command-1-300x63.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"><figcaption>Command decoded from the <code>Cache-Control</code> response header</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Upon receiving such a command, the extension downloads the second stage from <code>command['uu']</code> in a function named <code>siblingAfter</code>, which is also hidden inside <code>jquery.js</code>. The dollar sign from <code>command['jj']</code> here represents the <code>jQuery</code> object, so the function uses the <code>jQuery.get</code> function to download the next stage from <code>command['uu']</code> and to store it in <code>localStorage.dataDefault</code>.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HzpS4w4egO3t741XBG4cHz2MsUZa1l9Yd9Bb6BzhxWHUPRipYkbOSypucgSWLsxyZS3zIYzvR2B8j1SqTxuhomnxtLP9F7Jx7WzHRUNnD-5OaK4gl5yuKwojg7cJXv7zfip0vmsT" alt=""><figcaption>Code snippet that downloads the next stage from the URL specified in <code>command['uu']</code></figcaption></figure></div>

					<p>The laser scanning microscope is a special light microscope which uses a focused laser beam to scans the sample. The scanning of the laser across the sample is done by driving the laser in x and y direction.&nbsp; The image is composed in the software by combining the measured light points.</p>
<p>The DVD Laser Scanner Microscope is build from two DVD pick-up heads. The laser of the DVD head is used to illuminate the sample at a tiny spot, focused with the DVD heads own focusing mechanism. The deviation of the laser is done by the pick-up heads lens moving coils.</p>

<h6>Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy</h6>
<p>A special case is the confocal laser scanning microscopy that enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures from sets of images obtained at different depths. Confocal laser scanning microscopes are often used in combination with fluorescence to study properties of biological samples such as cells.</p>

<h6>Image Resolution</h6>
<p>The resolution of the image is defined by the number of measurements taken in x direction and the number of lines in y. The maximum resolution is limited by the numerical aperture of the system’s objective lens and the wavelength of the laser as in conventional optical microscopes. In fluorescence observations, the resolution is often limited by the strength of the signal. More sensitive photo-detectors or increasing the intensity of the illuminating laser can compensate.</p>

<h6>Prototype Setup</h6>
<p>The first prototype set-up uses two pick-up head. One is emitting the laser and scanning in x direction. The second pick-up head carries the sample and moves in y direction. The photo-detector on the laser unit is removed and the signal is captured with a simple photo-diode. The coils are controlled by an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino</a> with drive electronics and the images is rendered in <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>.</p>

Get a random boolean (true/false)</h2><p>This function will return a boolean (true or false) using the <code>Math.random()</code> method. <code>Math.random</code> will create a random number between 0 and 1, after which we check if it is higher or lower than 0.5. That means it’s a 50%/50% chance to get either true or false.</p><p><undefined>

			<div>
				
<p>Reading a blog post about what’s <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/en/informatique/java-16-quoi-de-neuf/">coming up in JDK 16</a> recently,
I learned that one of the new features is support for Unix domain sockets (<a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/380">JEP 380</a>).
Before Java 16, you’d have to resort to 3rd party libraries like <a href="https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket">jnr-unixsocket</a> in order to use them.
If you haven’t heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket">Unix domain sockets</a> before,
they are "data communications [endpoints] for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system".
Don’t be put off by the name btw.;
Unix domain sockets are also supported by macOS and even Windows since <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/">version 10</a>.</p>
<p>Databases such as Postgres or MySQL use them for offering an alternative to TCP/IP-based connections to client applications running on the same machine as the database.
In such scenario,
Unix domain sockets are both more secure
(no remote access to the database is exposed at all; file system permissions can be used for access control),
and also <a href="https://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2012.html#June_6_2012">more efficient</a> than TCP/IP loopback connections.</p>
<p>A common use case are proxies for accessing Cloud-based databases,
such as as the GCP <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy#proxy_startup_options">Cloud SQL Proxy</a>.
Running on the same machine as a client application
(e.g. in a sidecar container in case of Kubernetes deployments),
they provide secure access to a managed database, for instance taking care of the SSL handling.</p>
<p>My curiousity was piqued and I was wondering what it’d take to make use of the new Java 16 Unix domain socket for connecting to Postgres.
It was your regular evening during the pandemic,
without much to do, so I thought "Let’s give this a try".
To have a testing bed, I started with installing Postgres 13 on Fedora 33.
Fedora might not always have the latest Postgres version packaged just yet,
but following the official <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/">Postgres instructions</a> it is straight-forward to install newer versions.</p>
<p>In order to connect with user name and password via a Unix domain socket,
one small adjustment to <em>/var/lib/pgsql/13/data/pg_hba.conf</em> is needed:
the access <code>method</code> for the <code>local</code> connection type must be switched from the default value <code>peer</code>
(which would try to authenticate using the operating system user name of the client process) to <code>md5</code>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>...
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Make sure to apply the changed configuration by restarting the database
(<code>systemctl restart postgresql-13</code>),
and things are ready to go.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_postgres_jdbc_driver">The Postgres JDBC Driver</h2>
<div>
<p>The first thing I looked into was the Postgres <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/">JDBC driver</a>.
Since version <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_9.4-1208">9.4-1208</a> (released in 2016) it allows you to configure custom socket factories,
a feature which explicitly was added considering Unix domain sockets.
The driver itself doesn’t come with a socket factory implementation that’d actually support Unix domain sockets,
but a few external open-source implementations exist.
Most notably junixsocket provides such <a href="https://kohlschutter.github.io/junixsocket/dependency.html#PostgreSQL">socket factory</a>.</p>
<p>Custom socket factories must extend <code>javax.net.SocketFactory</code>,
and their fully-qualified class name needs to be specified using the <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html#unix%20sockets">socketFactory</a> driver parameter.
So it should be easy to create <code>SocketFactory</code> implementation based on the new <a href="https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk16/docs/api/java.base/java/net/UnixDomainSocketAddress.html">UnixDomainSocketAddress</a> class, right?</p>

<p>It compiles just fine;
but it turns out not all socket addresses are equal,
and <code>java.net.Socket</code> only connects to addresses of type <code>InetSocketAddress</code>
(and the PG driver maintainers seem to sense some air of mystery around these "unusual" events, too):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code>org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: Something unusual has occurred to cause the driver to fail. Please report this exception.

</div>
<p>Now JEP 380 solely speaks about <code>SocketChannel</code> and stays silent about <code>Socket</code>;
but perhaps obtaining a socket from a domain socket channel works?</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>Socket</span> <span>createSocket</span><span>()</span> <span>throws</span> <span>IOException</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Nope, no luck either:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Indeed it looks like JEP 380 is concerning itself only with the non-blocking <code>SocketChannel</code> API,
while users of the blocking <code>Socket</code> API do not get to benefit from it.
It should be possible to create a custom <code>Socket</code> implementation based on the socket channel support of JEP 380,
but that’s going beyond the scope of my little exploration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_vert_x_postgres_client">The Vert.x Postgres Client</h2>
<div>
<p>If the Postgres JDBC driver doesn’t easily benefit from the JEP,
what about other Java Postgres clients then?
There are several non-blocking options,
including the <a href="https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-pg-client/java/">Vert.x Postgres client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pgjdbc/r2dbc-postgresql">R2DBC</a>.
The former is used to bring Reactive capabilities for Postgres into the Quarkus stack, too,
so I turned my attention to it.</p>
<p>Now the Vert.x Postgres Client already has support for Unix domain sockets,
by means of adding the right Netty native transport dependency to your project.
So purely from functionality perspective, there’s not that much to be gained here.
But being able to use domain sockets also with the default NIO transport would still be nice,
as it means one less dependency to take care of.
So I dug a bit into the code of the Postgres client and Vert.x itself and figured out, that two things needed adjustment:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The NIO-based <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/blob/master/src/main/java/io/vertx/core/net/impl/transport/Transport.java"><code>Transport</code></a> class of Vert.x needs to learn about the fact that <code>SocketChannel</code> now also supports Unix domain sockets (currently, an exception is raised when trying to use them without a Netty native transport)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netty’s <a href="https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/socket/nio/NioSocketChannel.java"><code>NioSocketChannel</code></a> needs some small changes, as it tries to obtain a <code>Socket</code> from the underlying <code>SocketChannel</code>, which doesn’t work for domain sockets as we’ve seen above</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Step 1 was quickly done by creating a custom sub-class of the default <code>Transport</code> class.
Two methods needed changes:
<code>channelFactory()</code> for obtaining a factory for the actual Netty transport channel,
and <code>convert()</code> for converting a Vert.x <code>SocketAddress</code> into a NIO one:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>UnixDomainTransport</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Transport</span> <span>{</span>

</div>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> class.
I was hoping to get away again with creating a sub-class of the NIO-based implementation,
<code>io.netty.channel.socket.nio.NioSocketChannel</code> in this case.
Unfortunately, though, the <code>NioSocketChannel</code> constructor invokes the taboo <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> method.
Of course that’d not be a problem when doing this change in Netty itself,
but for my little exploration I ended up copying the class and doing the required adjustments in that copy.
I ended up doing two small changes:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoiding the call to <code>SocketChannel#socket()</code> in the constructor:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>UnixDomainSocketChannel</span><span>(</span><span>Channel</span> <span>parent</span><span>,</span> <span>SocketChannel</span> <span>socket</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span><span>,</span> <span>socket</span><span>);</span>
    <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>NioSocketChannelConfig</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>Socket</span><span>());</span> <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i data-value="1"></i><b>1</b></td>
<td>Passing a dummy socket instead of <code>socket.socket()</code>, it shouldn’t be accessed in our case anyways</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few methods call the <code>Socket</code> methods <code>isInputShutdown()</code> and <code>isOutputShutdown()</code>;
those should be possible to be by-passed by keeping track of the two shutdown flags ourselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As I was creating the <code>UnixDomainSocketChannel</code> in my own namespace instead of Netty’s packages,
a few references to the non-public method <code>NioChannelOption#getOptions()</code> needed commenting out,
which again shouldn’t be relevant for the domain socket case</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You can find the complete change in <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/unix-domain-socket-poc/commit/9d8502f5c47cb59162e325640db54672f1ed8b68">this commit</a>.
All in all, not exactly an artisanal piece of software engineering,
but the little hack seemed good enough at least for taking a quick glimpse at the new domain socket support.
Of course a real implementation could be done much more properly within the Netty project itself.</p>
<p>So it was time to give this thing a test ride.
As we need to configure the custom <code>Transport</code> implementation,
retrieval of a <code>PgPool</code> instance is a tad more verbose than usual:</p>
<div>

            <p>February 2021</p>
            <p id="article-description">Using my own web server accesslogs and public
            latency data to get a quantitative answer and why roundtrips are such a
            pain.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/network-transit-times.svg" alt="...">
                <figcaption>
                    <p>As network latencies grow, strange things can happen: "fat"
                    sites can become fast (especially if served completely from CDN)
                    and "thin" sites that use APIs can become slow. A typical latency
                    for a desktop/laptop user is 200ms, for a 4G mobile user,
                    300-400ms.</p>
                    <p>I've assumed <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/896779/average-mobile-fixed-broadband-download-upload-speeds/">
                    40 megabit bandwidth</a>, TLS, latency to CDN of <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2019/08/28/analysing-global-cdn-performance/">
                    40ms</a> and no existing connections.</p>
                    <p>"Origin" here means the primary webserver (as opposed to "edge"
                    CDN caches).</p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>What's the fastest place to put my server? Beyond the time taken for
            servers to respond to requests it takes time just to traverse the internet,
            just to get a packet from A to B.</p>
            <p>To estimate what the theoretical best physical place to put my own
            server is I've combined publicly publicly available data on latencies with
            my own web server accesslogs. I'm aiming to get a rough, quantitative,
            answer that's based on a real data set.</p>
            <h2>Why location matters</h2>
            <p>Time taken to traverse the internet is added to the time taken to
            respond to a request. Even if your API can respond to a request in 1ms, if
            the user is in London and your API server is in California the user still
            has to wait ~130 milliseconds for the response.</p>
            <p>It's a bit worse than just 130 milliseconds. Depending on what a user is
            doing they may end up making a number of those roundtrips. To download a
            web page usually requires five full roundtrips: one to resolve the domain
            name via DNS, one to establish the TCP connection, two more to set up an
            encrypted session with TLS and one, finally, for the page you wanted in the
            first place.</p>
            <p>Subsequent requests <em>can</em> (but don't always) reuse the DNS, TCP
            and TLS setup but a new roundtrip is still needed each time the server is
            consulted, for example for an API call or a new page.</p>
            <p>130ms sounded fast at first, but the rigmarole of just getting a page
            and then making an couple of API calls can easily end up taking most of a
            second just in terms of time waiting for the network. All the other time
            required: for the server to decide what response to send to your request,
            time downloading the thing and then rendering whatever it is in your
            browser - that is all extra.</p>
            <h3>The two kinds of "fast" for networks</h3>
            <p>One of the confusing things about networking is the inspecific way in
            which people talk of getting "faster" networking: "faster" residental
            broadband for example, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Ethernet">"fast ethernet"</a> (100
            megabits per second, no longer impressive).</p>
            <p>This kind of "faster" is not in fact talking about speed. Greater speed
            would be reduced latency - so faster roundtrips. Instead "faster"
            networking is really about <em>greater bandwidth</em>: more bytes per
            second.</p>
            <h3>APIs or CDNs</h3>
            <p>One thing that does make things faster: a Content Distribution Network
            (or CDN). Instead of going all the way to California perhaps you can
            retrieve some of the web page from a cache in central London. Doing this
            saves time - perhaps taking just 50 milliseconds, a saving of 60%. Caches
            work great for CSS files, images and javascript - stuff that doesn't change
            for each user. It doesn't work as well for the responses to API calls, for
            which the responses are different for each user, and sometimes, each
            time.</p>
            <h2>A quantitative approach</h2>
            <p>A happy few can serve everything from their CDN. News sites, for
            example, show the exact same thing to everyone. Others are less lucky and
            can make only limited, or no, use of caching. These poor people have to
            pick a location for their main server to help them get their bytes to the
            users who want them as fast as possible. If they want to make that choice
            with the sole aim of reducing latency, where should they pick?</p>
            <p>Here's what I did:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I took my own accesslogs for a two week period in September just
                after I'd published something new. I got about a million requests
                during this period from 143k unique IPs. I excluded obvious robots
                (which was ~10% of requests).</li>
                <li>I used Maxmind's GeoIP database to geocode each IP address in those
                accesslogs to geographic co-ordinates.</li>
                <li>I then used <a href="https://wondernetwork.com/pings">WonderNetwork's published latency
                data</a> for internet latencies between ~240 world cities.
                </li>
                <li>I mapped those cities (semi-manually, which was pretty painful)
                from their names to <a href="https://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a>
                ids - which gave me co-ordinates for the cities.
                </li>
                <li>Then I loaded all of the above into a Postgres database with the
                <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> extension installed so I
                could do geographical queries.
                </li>
                <li>I queried to estimate how long, by percentile, requests would have
                taken if I'd had my server in each of the 200 cities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>The results</h2>
            <p>In the table below I've recorded the outcome: how long users would take
            to complete a single roundtrip to my server if it were in each city. I've
            done this by percentiles so you have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the average ("p50")</li>
                <li>for three quarters of requests ("p75")</li>
                <li>and for 99% of requests ("p99")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All numbers are in milliseconds.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><div data-elementor-type="wp-post" data-elementor-id="9644" data-elementor-settings="[]"><div><div><section data-id="39453a45" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="28daaf9d" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="6259e7" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>In this Elastisys Engineering blog post, we show how to set up a production-ready Kubernetes cluster on Exoscale using kubespray and Terraform. It gets a control plane and a set of worker nodes, and leverages Rook and Ceph to get Persistent Volume support.</p><h2 id="why">Why install Kubernetes using kubespray?</h2><p>The reasons why one might want to install Kubernetes “manually” are many:</p><ul><li>Allows you to run Kubernetes on cloud providers even if they do not offer a managed Kubernetes service such as AKS, EKS, or GKE.</li><li>Not entangled with the cloud provider’s IAM or other services, which makes a multi-cloud strategy easier to implement in practice. This way, your tools and processes will not be cloud-vendor specific.</li><li>Allows full control over the control plane: if you want to install, e.g., an OpenID Connect provider such as Dex to integrate with your Identity Provider (IdP), you can. With a managed service, what you can or cannot do is at the mercy of your cloud provider.</li></ul><p>So let’s get to it!</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>Our cluster setup is as following:</p><ul><li>One control plane node: 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU, 50GB local storage.</li><li>Three worker nodes: 8GB RAM, 4 vCPU, 100GB local storage each.</li></ul><p>All nodes are running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The cluster is running Kubernetes v1.19.7 and is installed using kubespray 2.15.0. You will also need Terraform to follow along with this guide.</p><h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2><p>The first thing that is needed is to set up all the infrastructure needed for the cluster.</p><h3 id="terraform">Terraform</h3><p>The easiest way to deploy a production-ready Kubernetes cluster is to use the Terraform script from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kubespray</a></p><p>Clone kubespray for the script. Exoscale support is on master right now.</p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray.git
cd kubespray<br></code></pre><p>Create a new folder in the inventory folder for your cluster.</p><pre><code>CLUSTER=my-exoscale-cluster
cp -r inventory/sample inventory/$CLUSTER
cp contrib/terraform/exoscale/default.tfvars inventory/$CLUSTER/
cd inventory/$CLUSTER</code></pre><p>Edit <code>default.tfvars</code> and make sure that <code>ceph_partition_size</code> for all the workers is set to 50. <em>(To match the reference setup)</em></p><p>For authentication you can use a encrypted credentials file ~/.cloudstack.ini or ./cloudstack.ini. This file can be created by running:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; cloudstack.ini
[cloudstack]
key = 
secret = 
EOF
sops --encrypt --in-place --pgp  cloudstack.ini
sops cloudstack.ini</code></pre><p>Insert your API key in <code>key</code> and API secret in <code>secret</code>. Follow the <a href="https://community.exoscale.com/documentation/iam/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exoscale IAM Quick-start</a> to learn how to generate API keys.</p><p>To create the cluster, run the following and follow the instructions on the screen.</p><pre><code>terraform init ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale
sops exec-file -no-fifo cloudstack.ini 'CLOUDSTACK_CONFIG={} terraform apply -var-file default.tfvars ../../contrib/terraform/exoscale'</code></pre><p>You should now have a inventory file <code>inventory.ini</code> that you can use with kubespray. To test it and to make sure that all the nodes are properly up and running, run the following:</p><pre><code>ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all</code></pre><h3 id="other-setup">Other setup</h3><p>If you are setting up the nodes by yourself, please keep in mind that Exoscale at the time of writing doesn’t have support for adding additional disks. Therefore you need to split the root disk into multiple partitions.</p><p>This can be achieved by making sure that your instance has more than 50GB of disk and that the following lines is added to your user-data before booting.</p><pre><code>#cloud-config
bootcmd:
- [ cloud-init-per, once, move-second-header, sgdisk, --move-second-header, /dev/vda ]
- [ cloud-init-per, once, create-ceph-part, parted, --script, /dev/vda, 'mkpart 2 50GB -1' ] # Create ceph partition spanning from 50GB from start to end</code></pre><p>More information about this can be found in this blog post, <a href="https://elastisys.com/elastisys-engineering-how-to-set-up-rook-with-ceph-on-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rook Ceph on Kubernetes</a>.</p><h3 id="kubespray">kubespray</h3><p>When the infrastructure is up and running, it’s time to add Kubernetes on top of all this. If you have followed the suggested way of spinning up the infrastructure, you should be able to run:</p><pre><code>ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ../../cluster.yml -b -v</code></pre><p><em>NOTE: You might want to set the value <code>kubeconfig_localhost</code> in the file <code>group_vars/k8s-cluster/k8s-cluster.yml</code> to <code>true</code> to get the kubeconfig file. Just remember that it will use the private IP of the server, so update the server IP to match the IP of the control plane load balancer.</em></p><p>When Ansible is finished, verify that you have access to the Kubernetes cluster by running:</p><pre><code>kubectl get nodes</code></pre><h3 id="rook">Rook</h3><p>Install rook by installing the rook operator chart.</p><pre><code>helm repo add rook-release https://charts.rook.io/release
kubectl create namespace rook-ceph
helm upgrade --install --namespace rook-ceph rook-ceph rook-release/rook-ceph --version v1.5.5 --wait

# Need to use ceph v15.2.7 to be able to use partitions

curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rook/rook/d381196/cluster/examples/kubernetes/ceph/csi/rbd/storageclass.yaml | kubectl apply -n rook-ceph -f -</code></pre><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>In this article, we have shown how to set up a production-ready Kubernetes cluster on Exoscale using kubespray and Terraform, complete with Persistent Volume support via Rook and Ceph. These steps help you set up Kubernetes clusters on cloud environments where no managed service is available.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><strong>How we built a visual COVID-19 mask quality inspection prototype running on-device on an OpenMV-H7 board and the challenges on the way.</strong></p><p>‍</p><p>TLDR; The source code to train and deploy your own image classifier can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults" target="_blank">https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults</a></p><p>‍</p><p>In the summer of 2020, we worked with Arm to build an easy-to-use tutorial on how to train and deploy an image classifier on an Arm microcontroller. In this post, we show how we approached and solved the following challenges:</p><ul role="list"><li>Convert a PyTorch ResNet to TensorFlow and quantize it to use 8-bit integer values</li><li>Collect, select, and annotate data of faulty and non-faulty masks</li><li>Use self-supervised pre-training to boost model performance when working on fewer images.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>The Results to Expect</h3><p>The goal of this project was to show an end-to-end workflow on how to train and deploy a convolutional neural network to an OpenMV-H7 board.</p><p>The video below showcases how our classifier detects faulty masks in real-time.</p><figure id="w-node-1e0674653ff8-e7e87989"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ba1c1JkBnNc"></iframe></p></figure><h3>The OpenMV-H7 Board</h3><p>The board consists of an <a href="https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32h743vi.html" target="_blank">STM32H743VI</a> Arm Cortex-M7 processor running at 480MHz, multiple peripherals, and a camera module mounted on it.<br>The camera module has an <a href="http://www.ovt.com/products/sensor.php?id=80" target="_blank">OV7725</a> sensor from OmniVision and can record in VGA resolution (640x480) at 75 FPS.</p><p>Since the board has limited computing power and memory, we aimed for a very small deep learning model. We call the variant ResNet-9 since it’s more of a cut in half ResNet-18 variant. Below you can find some numbers about the model configuration, runtime, and other metrics.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Input size:</strong> 64x64x3 </li><li><strong>CPU Freq.:</strong> 480 MHz</li><li><strong>Operations:</strong> 33.4 MOp</li><li><strong>Model size: </strong>90 kBytes</li><li><strong>Inference Time: </strong>150 ms</li><li><strong>Operations/s</strong>: 249 MOp/s</li></ul><p>Detailed specs can be found on the official website of OpenMV <a href="https://openmv.io/products/openmv-cam-h7" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-54c1c743c46b-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1b05a6ba9ae8de6dd0_1*tN005NiVE1kZbBK9BwCRmw.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A close-up picture of the OpenMV H7 Board we used.</figcaption></figure><h3>Data Collection</h3><p>Neural networks are very data-hungry. In order to efficiently collect enough training data we did the following:</p><ol role="list"><li>We used the camera on the OpenMV-H7 board to record video sequences. With the USB interface and the <a href="https://openmv.io/pages/download" target="_blank">OpenMV IDE</a>, we were able to easily record the camera stream and save it as a video file.</li><li>To simulate a real production line we mounted the camera on cardboard to make sure the camera is stable. The optics point to the production line which is a metal plate with tall borders. This setup ensures, that the camera sees defect and non-defect masks within the same environment.</li><li>Finally, we moved masks through our inspection line using a combination of push and pull.</li></ol><figure id="w-node-aeaf7ee059b3-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1b93ae233273724258_1*fULWu10pKzaaYevH6g1wAw.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>A picture of our data collection pipeline. We cut a small hole into the cardboard to clamp the USB table holding the board into it.</figcaption></figure><h3>Data Selection and Annotation</h3><p>At this stage we have multiple video files, each having captured a few minutes. The next challenge is to extract the frames and annotate the data. We use FFmpeg for the frame extraction and <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> to select a diverse set of frames. Note that we had more than 20k frames but no time to annotate all of them. Using <a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> we selected a few hundred frames covering all relevant scenarios.<br><a href="http://lightly.ai/" target="_blank">Lightly</a> uses self-supervised learning to get good representations of the images. It then uses these representations to select the most interesting images which should be annotated. The benefit of this method is that we can access the pre-trained model and fine-tune it on only a handful of labeled images.</p><figure id="w-node-d0a8cad91e90-e7e87989"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f7ac1d59a6fc121dde87967/6006dd1bb94b015a4b0f3fab_1*PReJtvsyDDVwhWxQXDaI9w.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example images taken with the OpenMV H7 camera showing the three labels for the data. From left to right: good mask, defect mask, no mask.</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Model Fine-Tuning<br></strong>To prevent the model from overfitting, we simply froze the pre-trained backbone and added a linear classification head to the model. We then trained the classifier for 100 epochs on a total of 500 annotated images.</p><p>‍</p><h3>From PyTorch to Keras to TensorFlow Lite</h3><p>Moving the pre-trained PyTorch model to TensorFlow Lite turned out to be the most difficult part of our endeavor.</p><p>‍</p><p>We tried out several tricks with ONNX to export our model. A simple library called <a href="https://github.com/nerox8664/pytorch2keras" target="_blank">pytorch2keras</a> worked fine for a model only consisting of linear layers but not for our conv + linear model. </p><p>The main problem we encountered, was that PyTorch uses the CxHxW (channel, height, width) format for tensors whereas TensorFlow uses HxWxC. This meant that, after transforming our model to TensorFlow Lite, the output of the layer just before the classifier was permuted, and hence, the output of the classifier was incorrect. In order to address this problem, we considered manually permuting the weights of the linear classifier. </p><p>However, we decided to go for a simpler solution. We pooled the output of the last convolutional layer into a Cx1x1 shape. That way, changing the order of the channels does not affect the output of the neural network.</p><p>‍</p><p>The final step is to quantize and export the Keras model to TensorFlow Lite. In our case quantization reduces the model size and speeds up running the model in inference at the cost of a few percent lower accuracy.</p><p>Special thanks to our collaborators at Arm and <a href="https://medium.com/u/297b71d663f3" target="_blank">Philipp Wirth</a> from Lightly for making this project possible. The <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults" target="_blank">full source code is available here</a>. You can easily train your own classifier and run it on an embedded device.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I’ve been part of the internet startup scene for a while. There are so many different camps: the bootstrappers, the VC-backed tech-bros, the crypto “investors”, the people marketing their courses on marketing courses, the newsletter gurus, the micro-saas homeboys. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Each of these groups have their own, unique views on building companies and products. Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types, and each has its own subset of hard-core, flame-war inducing followers. Ah, the internet is a beautiful, terrible, magical, ghastly, colourful place.</p>
<p>I’ve been associated with, and in some cases, been a part of a few of these various subcultures. After working at a VC backed startup, I went the bootstrapped route (popularised by the IndieHackers movement) with my own product. It was an interesting ride, but was still rife with the Marketing Course Joes who just made $3000 last week with their “How to market no-code apps” course, as well as the Hustle Boys with their Twitter feeds full of “Work like no-one works today, so you can live like no-one lives tomorrow. #entrepreneur”. Neither of these resonated with me.</p>
<p>I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.</p>
<p>During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about. She would spend afternoons reading articles on permaculture, figuring out which plants grew well alongside other plants. Lavender with tomatoes kept the pests away, slight shade for the granadilla vine, some water, but not too much for the root vegetables. It was lovely to watch her coax tasty and nutritious food individually out of the ground. I can’t imagine full-scale farming being nearly as enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats. I’ve done this fairly successfully with <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a>. We have a small, diverse, and amazing community of artists and illustrators making awesome things. I’m trying to build a similar product with <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>. Something niche but valuable. Something I can spend time on because I want to.</p>
<p>Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling. Spending time meticulously improving subtle aspects of the product is enjoyable.</p>
<p>Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability. This will differ depending on where you are. I live in Cape Town, South Africa where the cost of living is low (compared to the US and EU). I reached basic profitability, matching an average developer salary here, about 10 months ago, and since then I’ve been improving my projects. Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.</p>
<p>This is my garden, and I intend to putter.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As the fallout of the <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">FSFE stalking scandal continues</a>, we are publishing below the leaked FSFE diversity strategy.</p>

<p>Here are the highlights we identified:</p>

<blockquote><em>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</em></blockquote>

<p>What is the real reason women don't want their name and picture on the FSFE web site?</p>

<blockquote><em>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).</em></blockquote>

<p>FSFE's biggest event is LLW but it is never advertised.  The registration process and the Call for Papers are hidden from the former Fellows and the Supporters.  Women will not participate in other Free Software events as long as the biggest events, like LLW, are hidden in the shadows.</p>

<blockquote><em>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women.</em></blockquote>

<p>Women employed as interns, men employed on permanent contracts.  As the recent court case demonstrates, all women on permanent contracts were <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">sacked for talking about equality</a>.  What Matthias Kirschner describes is analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch">Untermensch concept from the Third Reich</a>.  This isn't the first time <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/matthias-kirschner-fsfe-nazi-comparisons/">we find Kirschner's conduct is close to that of the Third Reich</a>.</p>

<p><img width="33%" alt="Olga Gkotsopoulou, FSFE, open source, intern, internship, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, VUB, law" src="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/girlie-hacking-grey-front-large.jpg"></p><blockquote><em>we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li><b>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek

   has very little time).</li>

is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul>
</em></blockquote>

<p>Why would <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga Gkotsopoulou</a>, a woman from Greece, want to continue working for Free after her paid German internship ends?  Why would a woman in Greece want to send money to a misogynist in Berlin?  What will this Greek money be used for, hiring more female interns in Kirschner's cramped little office?</p>

<p>Kirschner appears to be delusional about his obligation to pay people.  An internship is a contract that ensures the woman can never acquire maternity rights, the contract always finishes before they can become pregnant.  Women resent this.</p>

<blockquote><em>### In Progress

</em><ul><em>
</em><li><em> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
<ul>
 <li>Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
  <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that)</li>
</ul>
</em></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>This was the only definite action from the strategy, another Code of Conduct.  The way Kirschner <a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/court-case-fsfe-women-and-volunteers-face-modern-day-slavery/">went to this woman's home</a> demonstrates the reality of the Code of Conduct: leaders of open source organizations see themselves as God, they can do whatever they want and only apply their "enforcement" venom to their political rivals.</p>

<blockquote><em>
<p>Subject: Re: diversity and expanding the GA<br>
Date: Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:51:58 +0000<br>
From: Matthias Kirschner <mk@fsfe.org><br>
To: ga@fsfeurope.org</mk@fsfe.org></p>

<p>Dear GA members,

</p><p>thank you all for raising your points in this thread. As Hugo pointed
out we repeatedly had that discussion, and also worked on some points.
Still there were some new ideas in the thread and from the Council we
suggest a few action items to make further progress. But first, so that
everybody is on the same page, some examples of existing activities on
that topic.,/p&gt;

</p><p>## Some examples of what we already do/did

</p><ul>
<li>When we have pictures on our website we try to have equal wo/man on
 them. For example have a look at
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/gallery.en.html (this
 year we had some additions, before IIRC the ratio was better).</li>

<li>For the FSFE front page we asked women to provide quotes with picture:
 This worked for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Amaelle+Guiton&amp;ia=web">Amaelle</a>. Other female contributors were also initially
 interested in providing a quote, but other constrains prevented them
 from doing so.</li>
<li>At our events we encourage female speakers, as well as new speakers,
 and from different countries (e.g. LLW, but also at the summit).
 Although we have the same problem most conferences have, that is is
 really difficult to achieve that.</li>

<li>For the Legal Network council we started by picking the same ratio
 with men as with women.</li>

<li>For internships we meanwhile give preference to women. One reason is
 also because becoming intern is also increasing the chance to become
 an employment in the Free Software area.
 (https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html says "We want more
 women to be involved in Free Software. That's why we will give
 preference to applications from suitably qualified female
 candidates.")</li>

<li> As with males we also encourage female interns to stay active in the
 FSFE after their internships:
 <ul>
 <li>We hired Polina (<a href="https://fsfellowship.eu/assets/fsfe-llw-conflict-of-interest.pdf">resigned after FSFE/LLW Conflict of Interest scandal</a>) after her internship</li>
 <li>Nikos is currently talking with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Olga+Gkotsopoulou+fsfe+women+scandal&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web">Olga</a> about her becoming the Greek
   deputy coordinator.</li>
 <li>With <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=lucile+falgueyrac+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Lucile</a> we have regular contact and invite her to meetings (she
   has very little time).</li>
 <li>We work a lot with <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Eszter+Bako+fsfe&amp;ia=web">Eszter</a>, who is now assistent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Reda">Julia Reda</a>, but
   it might be difficult to include her further at the moment.</li>
 <li><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=Lusy+Vaseva+fsfe">Lusy</a>
is at the moment organising a Free Software event and
   coordinating with Matthias.</li>
 </ul></li>

<li>Staff was following-up with proposals from the past. For example
 Patrick Ohnewein before proposed Sonia Montegiove. Matthias had
 several talks with her and invited her to the FSFE summit. The problem
 is that she is quite shy when speaking English.</li>
<li>This year we had a
moderations workshop for our staff. Before it we
 clarified with the trainer that one of our goals is to enable our
 staff running more inclusive meetings. The workshop was documented in
 the wiki https://wiki.fsfe.org/Internal/Moderation (some permission
 problem at the moment, hope it is soon fixed).</li>
</ul>

<p>## Next Steps</p>

<p>### In Progress</p>

<ul>
<li> Finish and implement Code of Conduct:
 <ul>
 <li> Continue with the CoC, implement it, also against some critism (Erik
   worked on it with Heiki, but as it should be valid for the whole
   organisation so we said it would be good that we do not have several
   CoCs in the FSFE but try to merge it with the LLW CoC).</li>
 <li>help our groups to enforce it with a training about that topic next
   year (for the LLW Polina worked on a detailed guide what to keep in
   mind about that).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>### Possible actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussion with Ulrike about the topic. She studied gender studies and
 is very interested in the topic) about the topic. Together with her
 identify strategies for more diversity inside the FSFE community and
 the GA, by</li>
<ul>
<li>having a budget for counselling on diversity (as several
people
   pointed out, just because someone is a women in IT, does not know
   they know about diversity).</li>
<li> have a time budget for Ulrike to
help on this issue next year.</li>

<li> As some hesitate to just add women to the GA without first being
 involved in other areas, make it a priority to support already active
 or interested females (or other under represented groups).  * This
could include that we encourage them to join us in teams, and
   mentor them, or to invite them to events so we can meet them (could
   also include priority for travel funding in case we have to choose).
</li></ul>

<li>GA participation:
<ul><li>You might have realised that all our male
staffers are GA members,
   but none of our female staffers is. That is bad. We should encourage
   Polina and Ulrike to think about joining, too.</li>
 <li>Depending on the outcome of the FSFE2020 discussion: if we enlarge
   the council (as the FSFE board) introduce a quote there (as Daniel
   proposed to have a second VP position, with a requirement that at
   least one of the VP positions must not be male.)</li>
 <li>Depending on the Italian GA member's feedback, we could invite her
   as a guest to the next GA, or if they think it would be a good idea
   we can ask her to first become another coordinator for Italy as a
   first step.</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>https://fsfe.org/contribute/internship.en.html starts with a quote by
 a former male and female interns. But we should update one of the
 quotes by Erik or Hugo on that page with former quotes.</li>

<li>Make sure we have balanced quotes by women on our website / as well as
 the front page. E.g.
 https://fsfe.org/campaigns/ilovefs/whylovefs/whylovefs.en.html (either
 get more or think about removing this page for next years in the
 campaign)</li>
</ul>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Matthias</p>

February 3, 2021 | https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/writing-high-performance-f-code/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/writing-high-performance-f-code/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

		<!-- .post-header -->


		<div>
			<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While this post is addressed to F# .NET developers, it introduces much wider concepts starting from hardware architecture to overall .NET runtime and JIT compiler optimizations. It shouldn't be a surprise - optimizing the application performance requires us to understand the relationships between our high level code and what actually happens on the hardware.</p>
<p>There's a popular opinion that F# code must be slower than equivalent C# code. This opinion is mostly false, however it comes with some rationale. Usually comparison doesn't use <strong>equivalent</strong> code in both languages, and F# is generally more high level and declarative in nature. "Idiomatic" F# code doesn't always play well with .NET virtual machine. Writing code that is high level, declarative and fast on .NET platform is not an easy task.</p>
<p>In the examples below we'll use some common tools that will help us get better insight into nature of F# code:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sharplab.io/">Sharplab</a> allows us to easily inspect generated JIT intermediate representation, assembly or even equivalent C# code (which sometimes is approximate, since not all IL idioms are representable in C#) for a given F# snippet. For assembly code usually some extra mangling with params may be necessary for code to be generated as SharpLab sometimes cannot introspect F# core lib code.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/SergeyTeplyakov/ObjectLayoutInspector">Object Layout Inspector</a> lets us see how structs and classes will actually be represented in memory.</li>
<li><a href="https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/overview.html">BenchmarkDotNet</a> is very popular library for writing micro benchmarks. We'll use it to show heap allocations and execution times of our code.</li>
</ul>
<p>A correct profiling of the executing application is crucial before starting any work on optimizing the code - there's no sense in shaving last possible CPU cycles out of the function that's executed for 0.1% of the time.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for most day-to-day business applications, first way to solve performance problems is to reduce obvious mistakes (eg. replacing multiple I/O requests with one, writing more efficient database query etc.). If that was not the case, next step for satisfactory solution can be simply writing more imperative code - to make it easier to reason about for the compiler rather than human - or picking better-suited data structures. This is especially prevalent in F#, where we can observe pervasive usage of types like <code>'t list</code> (tip: if you're looking which collection to use and want good performance, F# list is almost never a good answer). Here we're about to go deeper, into area where we're about to compete with the prefabricated data types and algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="understandmemorylayoutofvaluetypes">Understand memory layout of value types</h2>
<p>One of the big performance gains, that .NET runtime uses to take advantage over other managed virtual machines (like JVM) in race for ultimate performance, often comes from using value types. So if we're about to go fast, we first need to understand how they work.</p>
<p>.NET structs represent types, which are not allocated separately on the managed memory heap, but rather inlined within the containing scope (instance of the class in case of fields, thread stack for variables, etc.). This means that usually they are cheaper and easier to access in high-allocation scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/content/images/2021/02/class-vs-struct-layout.png" alt="class-vs-struct-layout"></p>
<p>Historically, F# code was not very promising, when it comes to utilizing value types. Nowadays we got things like struct tuples - <code>struct('a * 'b)</code> which unfortunately are not widely used in F# even though in practice they should be preferable choice when working with tuples - and <code>[&lt;Struct&gt;]</code> attribute, that can be used on records and discriminated unions (we'll return to them later), making use of them became much more feasible.</p>
<p>However this doesn't necessarily mean, that replacing all reference types with value types will make our code magically go faster. In fact, this may be quite opposite. Why? Imagine what happens when we want to pass a record as a parameter. How is it done? Usually passing object to a function happens by copying reference to that object, which is either 4B or 8B depending on our OS being x86 or x64, and therefore fits perfectly into standard CPU register.</p>
<pre><code>type A() =
  class
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let print (value: 't) = System.Console.WriteLine(value.ToString())

let a = A() // sub rsp, 0x28
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d1a8
            // call 0x00007ff9730aade0 ; allocate A on the heap
print a     // mov rdx, rax            ; copy reference to a to the stack
            // mov rcx, 0x7ff91b23d5f8
            // call _.print[[System.__Canon, System.Private.CoreLib]](System.__Canon)
</code></pre>
<p>Now what if we're using structs? For reference types we copy object's reference on the stack - since reference is just a single address, it always can fit into register and be done within a single operation. For value types, we copy entire value instead. If they don't fit into register, we'll have to copy them over in multiple steps.</p>
<pre><code>type B =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
  end

let b = B() // sub rsp, 0x38
            // xor eax, eax       ; zero field b.x
            // xor ecx, ecx       ; zero field b.y
            // xor edx, edx       ; zero field b.z
print b     // lea r8, [rsp+0x28]
            // mov [r8], ecx      ; copy field b.x to the stack
            // mov [r8+4], eax    ; copy field b.y to the stack
            // mov [r8+8], edx    ; copy field b.z to the stack
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+B, _]](B)
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these steps is a machine instruction that takes time to execute. However, sometimes .NET can optimize that - pointer-sized registers are not only ones available in modern machines. We also have a special purpose SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) ones, that are much bigger and can be used as long as passed data fits into them perfectly.</p>
<pre><code>type C =
  struct
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable x: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable y: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable z: int
    [&lt;DefaultValue&gt;] val mutable zz: int
  end
  
let c = C() // sub rsp, 0x48
            // xor eax, eax             ; zero register
            // mov [rsp+0x38], rax      ; init fields b.x and b.y together with zero'ed register
            // mov [rsp+0x40], rax      ; init fields b.z and b.zz together with zero'ed register
print c     // vmovupd xmm0, [rsp+0x38] ; copy all 4 fields together on the stack using SIMD registers
            // vmovupd [rsp+0x28], xmm0
            // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28]
            // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C)
</code></pre>
<p>Another thing available in .NET, that allows us addressing inefficiencies of passing structs as arguments are so called by-ref parameters. There are 3 types of these, marked using <code>'t inref</code>, <code>'t outref</code>  and <code>'t byref</code>:</p>
<pre><code>let print(value: 't inref) = ...
let c = C()
print &amp;c // lea rcx, [rsp+0x28] ; copy address of the struct head onto the stack
         // call _.print[[_+C, _]](C ByRef)
</code></pre>
<p>Please, don't confuse by-ref parameters with <code>ref</code> data type:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'a ref</code> is actually an alias for <code>Ref&lt;'a&gt;</code> class, therefore allocated on the heap and passed by reference. In general, using this class in F# very rarely has sense (outside of writing exemplar, idiomatic code).</li>
<li><code>'a byref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>ref</code> parameter tag - it means that we're passing reference (memory address) to an object or struct. It expects it to be initialized and can be used to change the contents of the underlying value. For this reason F# requires fields and variables passed as <code>byref</code> to be declared with <code>mutable</code> keyword.</li>
<li><code>'a outref</code> is equivalent to C# <code>out</code> parameter tag - it always must be initialized by the end of the function body. This may sound a bit tricky as F# doesn't put that requirement explicitly. If we didn't make that assignment in any of the code branches, F# compiler will simply initialize it for us with default value (just like using <code>Unchecked.defaultof&lt;_&gt;</code>), which sometimes may lead to null reference exceptions.</li>
<li><code>'a inref</code> is the youngest of these and is equivalent of C# <code>in</code> parameter - while in C# structs passed as arguments for that parameters don't have to be tagged,  F# will always require to mark passing by ref (using <code>&amp;</code> prefix for passed argument) for any parameter marked with <code>byref</code>/<code>inref</code>/<code>outref</code>. <code>inref</code> is basically an optimization technique for what we saw above - it allows us to pass struct into a function using only its memory address, without copying entire struct contents. Additionally <code>inref</code> says that parameter is treated as read only, so it cannot be modified inside of function body. .NET JIT can utilize this information in some cases to reduce number of safety checks, therefore reducing number of instructions to be executed.</li>
</ul>
<p>While using by-ref parameters is usually good idea when it comes to writing code targeting complex value types, there are several limitations to it.</p>
<p>One is that arguments passed using by-ref params cannot be captured by closures/lambdas/anonymous functions, which prevents them from being used in more abstract code:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  [1..10]
  |&gt; List.map (fun x -&gt; x + a) // `a` is captured by closure, which is compilation error
  
// RIGHT
let doSomething (a: int inref) =
  let mutable result = []
  for x=10 downto 1 do
    result &lt;- (x + a)::result
  result
</code></pre>
<p>This includes problems even for common inlined functions like eg. pipe operator <code>|&gt;</code>. That's the price, we have to pay for speed (at least for now).</p>
<p>Second issue is that, at the moment by-ref parameters cannot be involved in building nested functions (regardless if they capture the values from function in outer scope or not). This again makes very inconvenient to use them in cases like tail recursive loop pattern:</p>
<pre><code>// WRONG!
let doSomething (a: 'a) =
  let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) = // this nested function won't compile
    if n = 0 then ()
    else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  loop 100 &amp;a

// RIGHT
let rec loop n (x: 'a inref) =
  if n = 0 then ()
  else loop (n-1) &amp;x
  
let doSomething (a: …</code></pre></div></article></div>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A certain business process had been automated three years before. A small team of engineers had formed around a business need to meet some legal compliance issues, wrote the first version, and then left it in the hands of a product team that included one of the initial engineers.</p>

<p>It was plain sailing for a few years. The code expanded to automate more aspects of the compliance problem, and a third party system integrated to handle some issues that were not first-class concerns of the business logic. The team proceeded naturally, with some members leaving, and others taking over.</p>

<p>The first crack was that the third party system didn’t catch on with other parts of the business (even though it was widely applicable). Therefore, fewer candidates with good contextual knowledge remained in the face of natural attrition. Attrition was worrying, accelerated by some interpersonal issues and the standard flow of enquiries from hiring competitors.</p>

<p>The apparent saving grace against attrition were the contractors who had been present for the maintenance of this code. They appeared happy, and the relationship between the customer and client was strong, so they weren’t going anywhere.</p>

<p>When the last internal person left, the contractors became more isolated from the rest of the business. Three internal product owners engaged with the space and eventually moved on, but these contractors soldiered on, albeit with less oversight and awareness of the broader technical goals of the company.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the business hit funding difficulties when the VC darling of the local tech community pulled out of a <em>signed</em> term sheet because of a global investment crisis. This VC presented themselves as the saviour of local startups during that crisis, but a dark possibility is that they thought that the company could be bought for a better price after the crisis did some shaking.</p>

<p>All contractors (and a third of the permanent workforce) were out within a month of the deal failing, leaving no-one who knew the code.</p>

<p>Four engineers found themselves in the space vacated by two teams, looking after various systems including this code. Over months they pieced together a picture of how it was supposed to work, learning (amongst other things) that the process had been broken for months before they took over. Fixes went in, and increased monitoring was added.</p>

<p>Unfortunately attrition had not taken a break during the crisis: ten months later one departure, another pending resignation, an extended period of leave for a third member, and a hiring freeze left the team poorly positioned for the ongoing flood of production issues.</p>

<p>The two available members soldiered on, trying to make sure that the old code would be safe with fewer and fewer people available to maintain it (if you’re counting, the two would soon be reduced to one after a completed notice period).</p>

<p>One day, this code didn’t produce what was expected. The process needed to be complete by Saturday at 5pm, or lawyers had to get involved. It was Friday at 3pm, and one of the members was expecting to celebrate his partner’s 30th birthday the next day.</p>

<p>He left at 5pm on Friday, grateful for his teammate’s willingness to handle the problem for what would still (he assumed) be a few hours, and enjoyed a pleasant evening of birthday events with the family.</p>

<p>The next morning, he woke to see that the other teammate had been working all night on the problem and couldn’t continue. The happy path was fixed, but the lawyers would still need to get involved for the exceptions. With a few hours effort he believed he had a fighting chance of tracking down the exceptions, but again, it was his partner’s birthday.</p>

<p>Distracted by party preparations, it was not a good time to deal with: logging that was unfamiliar and slow to search; builds that took 45 minutes to get anything into production; flaky tests; data investigation tools that took hours to fetch the necessary data (and it was later realised, would have produced the wrong data); and some poor abstractions from years of maintenance without strong awareness of the big picture.</p>

<p>What should have been a simple matter (read some logs, run some code based on the results) ended up going nowhere. Eventually the truth had to be faced: they’d pick this up on Monday, with or without the lawyers.</p>

<p>The moral is related to frequent engineering decisions. Is your code understandable and resilient, are errors easily understood and recoverable, are builds are fast and stable, are feedback loops fast enough to learn and make change? Is your system isolated in a way that will reduce the number of people who can contribute usefully?</p>

<p>When you make these decisions, consider that it will not be you in your current context, with your current teammates for whom it matters.</p>

<p>It will matter a year or more after you and all your teammates are gone, when the person using all this has worked through the night, or is severely distracted by important, once-in-a-liftetime family events. It will matter when lawyers need to get involved if things go wrong, and it will matter when the company has less money to spend on tech than it does now.</p>

<p>There are a few caveats here:</p>

<p>First, companies sometimes make the decision to grow today at the expense of sustainability because there will be no point in sustainability if the business does not exist tomorrow. Product leaders or management may even oppose some of these ideas for this reason. I feel fortunate that in my current role, people are particularly receptive about ideas on how to avoid disasters, but it was not always like this.</p>

<p>Less charitably, middle management may be ignorant of the consequences, and their incentives are also often out of line with long running systems. They may even be consciously aware that the next rung of the ladder will come before they would have to deal with the consequences of making unsustainable decisions.</p>

<p>As engineers it often falls to us to educate people on the benefits of “non-feature” work. Ideally things like fast feedback loops will make you grow faster, as well as being more sustainable in the long term, but people who have not seen this work may struggle to understand.</p>

<p>Lastly, no single person’s decisions matter on their own, because that person will not be around to see the results. What matters is that there is a culture that can push everyone in a healthy direction.</p>

We track every single thing that’s trackable; page visits, followers, impressions, likes, shares, diet, sleep, dream, sex, calories — everything. While the use of analytics is valid in some cases, were we such analytics freaks just a decade ago?</span></span></p><h2 id="block-9a6cf2f7e066445cbd212ba79104e402"><span id="9a6cf2f7e066445cbd212ba79104e402"></span><span><span><strong>Anxiety</strong></span></span></h2><p><span><span>Analytics overload leads to unnecessary anxiety. When people share their supposedly impressive stats online, we instinctively compare theirs to our own. If we are better, we flaunt. If we are lesser, we feel stressed out. Rarely do we ever feel content. This is normal because we are not angels. However, we can learn to minimize this unnecessary anxiety and lead a happier, calmer life.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A simple way to reduce analytics anxiety is to avoid it altogether. Your personal site doesn’t need an analytics script. Your casual blog site doesn’t need an analytics script. You don’t need to visit your app’s analytics page every day. You don’t need to track your REM cycle when you sleep. Remove all of them, and you will see a difference in your life within just a few days. You will have more time to yourself and feel more positive.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes, it is inevitable when your social media friends share something analytics related like Twitter followers count and Gumroad payments. It is not a bad thing per se because it can motivate you to work harder. However, try your best not be too concerned with it. Either ignore or wish them good. Fill your feed with things you enjoy instead, like sports or science. Focus on making yourself happy rather than comparing your life to others.</span></span></p><p><span><span>If you really need to use analytics, set aside a time to study it. Once that time is up, remove the analytics tab from your view because it will be a distraction to you. If you are using analytics for your websites, I'd recommend using something like </span><span><a href="http://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible.io</a></span><span> or </span><span><a href="http://simpleanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simpleanalytics.com</a></span><span>. One notable feature that they offer is an email summary of your sites' performance for each week or month. This is great because now you don't need to check in as often.</span></span></p><h2 id="block-b5666e09bbeb43d48ea1583005bbd0dd"><span id="b5666e09bbeb43d48ea1583005bbd0dd"></span><span><span><strong>Noise</strong></span></span></h2><p><span><span>Realize that analytics wasn’t even a thing a decade or more ago. Life was calmer and less competitive for attention. We managed to diet well, sleep soundly, and build healthy businesses without a care about analytics. Analytics is the new noise, and we should try to plug our ears whenever possible.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Despite writing this, I was, and still am guilty of being an analytics freak. But I’m doing my best to minimize my obsession and revert to how I was in the 2000s when life was evidently calmer. Oops, did I just give away my age?</span></span></p><p><span><span><code>Happy to chat</code></span></span></p><ul><li id="block-e7e22e9ff6cf4edaa608c694aca55a7b"><span><span>Tweet me on </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/yusufgiftworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></span></span></li></ul></article></div></div></div>]]>

		<div>
			
<p>I am 100% serious with the title, despite the appearance of click-bait. Mastodon has a serious structural rot that is only worsening as time gets on. I think this is for a few reasons which I will outline below.</p>



<p>Ironically, I don’t feel safe posting this directly to the fediverse because of the very forces I’m about to describe. I’m not worried about the cancel crew, I just don’t want to deal with hostile interactions right now. I might link to this post but it’s less likely to get hate mail I suspect if I do it that way rather than write this all up in a giant thread on fedi.</p>



<p>What I am presenting is largely anecdotal opinion, although it has been gathered from countless others (I’m not going to name any names, they deserve better than harassment or people trying to change their views and in the process merely reinforcing them).</p>



<h2>Background on myself</h2>



<p>I’ve been on Mastodon since April 2017. I was on “fedi” (well, the ostatus fediverse) before that, on long-gone instances I forgot the name of. I was on Mastodon in the very early days of its development, when content warnings were brand new, blocking/silencing was seriously broken, and fedi was just getting exciting due to press coverage. Before this, I was on IRC since 2005 and an IRC operator on a small network (it’s not glamorous, trust me).</p>



<h2>The problem</h2>



<p>Fedi has a problem as the title says: it’s crumbling. It’s a lot less vibrant than when I joined up, even back when GNUSocial roamed the earth (it was a pile of shit trying to imitate Twitter and mostly filled with people banned from Twitter for GamerGate and going too far, even for Twitter’s lax standards of the day).</p>



<p>It actually baffles me why so much of the Mastodon userbase can be traced back to the Tumblr/Twitter leftist crowd, when Fedi’s beginnings were on a network largely consisting of ultra-right people thrown off Twitter. I can only speculate, but I suspect the main reasons are they believed they would be safer (which is a joke), and many themselves (or their friends at least) were banned from those platforms for similarly shitty behaviour.</p>



<p>But it’s a mistake to believe that Fedi is safer at all. In fact, in many ways, it’s worse.</p>



<h3>Fedi is the least safe place around</h3>



<p>The thing about Fedi is that due to its nature, it has a low bar to entry. Anyone can make an instance at any time for not a whole lot of money. There are tons of far-right instances littering the place, and few admins can truly keep up (the worst-kept secret amongst Mastodon admins I would say). Most of the userbase just blocks them on an ad-hoc basis and moves on (or doesn’t notice them), but the fact that the Nazis haven’t really taken over the place is only by their mere incompetence.</p>



<p>To illustrate the problem, I will tell you about this: the largest instance on the Fediverse.</p>



<p>Oh, no, not mastodon.social. They’re big, but not as big as the largest. The largest is Pawoo, with around a million users last I checked. It’s owned by Pixiv, a Japanese company (think Japanese DeviantArt). And if Fedi knew even a rudimentary level of Japanese (this would require widespread non-Western cultural awareness they do not possess), they wouldn’t have joined in the first place. Japanese nationalism is everywhere on Pawoo, and the admins largely don’t care (granted: I don’t pay much attention to it and filtered it a long time ago, this may not be the case any longer). There is a certain irony I love about the largest Fedi instance being a commercial entity, despite the English speakers of the Fediverse largely eschewing corporations and brands. They also allow loli and (fictional) artwork of children, which is not banned in Japan but is a grey area in the US as advised by legal counsel for IF (I personally don’t want to test it, if you want to, have fun, leave me out of it).</p>



<p>Pawoo mostly sits there, under the radar, because they don’t speak English, and many instances blocked them a long time ago (I remember the great Pawoo discourse of 2017). There are tons and tons of other instances that most people don’t even know about that spew things that are far worse.  We at mst3k actually have <a href="https://mst3k.interlinked.me/about/more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a pretty big list</a>, and it ain’t even close to how many are actually out there. I just block them as I see them. Granted, many of those instances are long-gone, but there are many more to replace them.</p>



<h3>The faux-woke crowd is making fedi less safe</h3>



<p>I know this one is going to get me flamed and called racist or whatever the fuck, but so be it.</p>



<p>Now, full disclosure: I am partially Romani, Native American, but mostly (and certainly culturally raised) white, but <a href="https://weirder.earth/@WeirderAdmin/105640549522292568" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve listened to what other PoC have to say on this matter.</a></p>



<p>Fedi has a really bad problem: race-based trolling. There is a huge contingent on Fedi that is taking advantage of white guilt to troll the ever-loving fuck out of people.</p>



<p>I know this sounds like an amusing thing and is very much a “so what, they’re white” moment.  But I assure you, it’s anything but funny, and it’s causing minorities to be shed from Fedi.</p>



<p>Let me give a specific example: in mid-2020, a Jewish non-binary person was harassed by a member of one of the instances that host many of these trolls. People were still reluctant to do the right thing and block the instance, because they didn’t want to be called racist. The thing is, you can be a minority and still be a fucking dickhead, and you can also still be racist (without even realising it!) and act in bigoted ways against other minorities (go look up the Cherokee freedmen controversy for a really, really, really bad look into how far this can go). But nothing about your skin colour or ethnicity says “I can troll whoever I want.” Anyone who tells you otherwise is a troll and you should block and report them. If their admin won’t do anything, remove them.</p>



<p>The thing is, these kinds of games cheapen real racial justice. These people are less interested in racial justice for all and more interested in getting a rise out of people. And people are too afraid to stand up to it. This is a cancer silently driving people back to Twitter. I don’t think it’s the only thing stacked against Fedi, but it’s a huge one.</p>



<h3>The cancel crowd</h3>



<p>I’m going to say it: the canceldon crowd are obnoxious. They’re a holdover from Twitter and Tumblr. I won’t go into the whole “why cancelling is a waste of time” thing, but suffice it to say: cancelling doesn’t really fucking work, and it’s just a nice way of saying “doing what 4chan does to people it hates, but poorly.” Which is to say, harassment and trolling people. And of course people think it’s okay, even when they fuck up and sometimes cancel the wrong person or have bad info or got led on (this is never discussed, of course, and there is never an apology).</p>



<p>These people are literally making Fedi inherently less safe for everyone, and are no better than the crowd that used to be on Fedi (and still are to an extent) before Gargron decided to co-opt the Fediverse for his own gain.</p>



<h3>The people who write the software are fucking dickheads</h3>



<p>I’m going to be honest with you: Gargron (the guy who makes Mastodon) is an asshole. His reputation precedes him, so I won’t go into detail. However, I found out from a former IRL friend of mine (who will remain nameless) that he once asked her if he could continue to refer to her by her dead name. Said friend referred to Gargron as a “shitty liberal,” and I do not mean in the US sense.</p>



<p>The people at Pleroma are not much better. I mean, Alex Gleeson, enough said.</p>



<p>The only two relevant pieces of Fedi software are Pleroma and Mastodon. ActivityPub is such a horrible protocol, and Mastodon has butchered it so much, it’s impossible to make an interoperable implementation without man-months of work. To reimplement Mastodon from the ground up would be a nightmare. And forking Mastodon sounds great, but you’re up against a huge pile of technical debt. You could fork Pleroma, but then you’d have to know Elixir (a language few people know).</p>



<p>Also, the last time a major fork happened in Mastodon (aside from Glitch), it was mostly a group of non-developers who hoped they could cult their way into a dev team. It didn’t work.</p>



<p>I wanted to fix this problem but I decided it wasn’t worth it, and you’d have to be up against a community who is watching your every mistake and will find a reason to pillory you if you fuck up.</p>



<h3>“Mastodon” never developed a culture of its own</h3>



<p>You know, if you leave a container of yoghurt out for 4 years, it develops a culture. That’s more than can be said for the Mastodon part of Fedi, which has never outgrown being an offshoot of Twitter and Tumblr.</p>



<p>This is to its detriment, as it’s not a compelling place on the surface. People come in waves, and most leave again when Twitter and Tumblr rights its wrongs. I’ve seen this happen multiple times.</p>



<p>Mastodon users would do well to stop treating Fedi as Twitter, but of course, Mastodon and Pleroma as platforms basically both treat Fedi as Twitter expanded universe. It’s no coincidence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gargron has joined Twitter’s federation initative.</a> I have no hopes Fedi will develop a meaningful distinct culture before its too late.</p>



<h3>The tools to protect users are rotten fruit in an opaque bag</h3>



<p><em>Note: this was edited in after the fact. I meant to include it in the original.</em></p>



<p>I’m going to say what many admins lack the bravery or vision to say: the tools to protect the users of Mastodon are inadequate. Pleroma got this better, but many Mastodon users cancel any Pleroma user on sight (as I explain below).</p>



<p>The filtering sucks (it displays “filtered” unless you choose to permanently delete any posts containing a keyword). The default guide for setting up ElasticSearch (the thing that enables search) had (may still have for all I know) no mention of using a firewall or listening only on localhost (Gargron pushed back on requests to mention this), which would enable anyone in theory to connect to …</p></div></article></div>

                    <p>Brain iron dyshomeostasis with iron accumulation is a known feature of brain aging. 
The cause of this iron accumulation is aging is unknown, but the immune system is less active in older people, and as viruses replicate more efficiently in iron-rich senescent cells, they may have developed the ability to induce this phenotype in aging host tissues.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33220280/">has been proposed several times</a> that metal dyshomeostasis could be an underlying mechanism responsible for the initiation and progression of the pathological changes associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including the motor and extra-motor symptoms of ALS.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33491917/">new paper proposes</a> an update of the iron hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease), based on large scale emerging evidence.</p>

<p>Iron featured historically early in Alzheimer's disease research efforts for its involvement in the amyloid and tau proteinopathies, yet iron neurochemistry remains peripheral in mainstream Alzheimer's disease research.</p>

<p>Much of the effort investigating iron in Alzheimer's disease has focused on the potential for iron to provoke the onset of disease, by promoting proteinopathy through increased protein expression, phosphorylation, and aggregation.</p>

<p>The authors provide new evidence from a large post mortem cohort that brain iron levels within the normal range are associated with accelerated ante mortem disease progression in cases with underlying proteinopathic neuropathology.</p>

<p>These results corroborate recent findings that argue for an additional downstream role for iron as an effector of neurodegeneration, acting independently of tau or amyloid pathologies.</p>

<p>The researchers hypothesize that the level of tissue iron is a trait that dictates the probability of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease by ferroptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death dependent on iron and characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides, and is genetically and biochemically distinct from other forms of regulated cell death such as apoptosis.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is initiated by the failure of the glutathione-dependent antioxidant defenses, resulting in unchecked lipid peroxidation and eventual cell death. Lipophilic antioxidants and iron chelators can prevent ferroptotic cell death.</p>

<p>A substantial body of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33513737/">preclinical evidence and early clinical data</a> has demonstrated that deferoxamine and other iron chelators have strong disease-modifying impacts in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke. Acting by the disease-nonspecific pathway of iron chelation, deferoxamine targets each of these complex diseases via multifactorial mechanisms.</p>

<p>Deferiprone another iron chelator <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Amyotrophic%20Lateral%20Sclerosis&amp;term=chelator&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=&amp;Search=Search">is tested in clinical trials against ALS</a> in France’s Lille CHU hospital.</p>

This blog post shares SPOUD’s story of engineering a simple application with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>, ksqlDB, and Red Hat’s Quarkus. Spoiler alert: It was a blast!</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are SPOUD, a small company based in Bern, the capital of Switzerland. We’re specialised in event-driven architectures, real-time decision-making, and streaming technologies, especially Kafka. Similar to other startups with spare office space, we created a small playground in the office to play table football. Being the geeks we are, we always find ways to make simple things look fancy, which is why we created “Töggelomat” (in Swiss German, “töggele” means “table football”), an application that keeps track of game scores and matches players according to their skills. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, we don’t play as much as we used to.</p>
<h2 id="goal"><a id="goal"></a>Goal</h2>
<p>We initially decided to make Töggelomat a reality at last year’s SPOUD hackathon. As stated earlier, we use Kafka a lot and have expertise in running clusters, connecting to data with Kafka Connect, and using AI together with stream processing. However, we hadn’t gotten the chance to really use <a href="https://ksqldb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ksqlDB</a>, and we wanted to try it out with Quarkus.</p>
<h2 id="play"><a id="play"></a>Let’s play</h2>
<p>As we now dive deep into the technical details behind building Töggelomat, you can look at our <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub project </a>for the source code. Note: the ksqlDB queries are very interesting.</p>
<p>First, we needed to think in terms of events versus static databases because everything is an event. Using the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">event sourcing technique</a>, we created a topic with a list of current employees.</p>
<p>Then, using ksqlDB queries, we created players with a starting score of 500 points.</p>
<pre>INSERT INTO toeggelomat_player
      SELECT 
            uuid,
            nickName, 
            email,
            500 as defensePoints,
            500 as offensePoints
       FROM employee;
</pre>
<p>With the query above, the <code>toeggelomat_player</code> compacted topic is filled every time a new employee is added to the topic <code>employee</code>.</p>
<p>To generate a new match, the Töggelomat application reads the last state from the <code>toeggelomat_player</code> topic and <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat/blob/master/backend/src/main/java/io/spoud/services/MatchRandomizeService.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">randomizes a fair match</a>. Once the players are chosen, the application generates a new match and displays it in the front end. When the match is done, the score is entered in the UI and the application publishes the topic <code>toeggelomat_match_result</code>. The topic is visible in SPOUD’s data platform product, <a href="http://agoora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agoora</a>, and displays the description of the topic, the inferred schema, and the profile with some example data. Feel free to register and try it out for yourself.</p>
<p>After a match result, we need to compute the score, which is based on the skills of the players. If two higher-ranked players win against two lower-ranked players, they will not earn a lot of points. In reverse, if the lower-ranked players win, they will be generously rewarded. The point computation is done <a href="https://github.com/spoud/toeggelomat/blob/55ec5dc879169333f147b0f24f12dc183ce11042/backend/src/main/java/io/spoud/services/MatchPointsService.java#L55-L71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the application</a>, and the score is published on the topic <code>toeggelomat_scores</code>.</p>
<p>With ksqlDB, we create four entries (one for each player) in the topic <code>toeggelomat_point_change</code> based on the score published in the topic <code>toeggelomat_scores</code>. The point changes are then applied to the topic <code>toeggelomat_player</code>, to close the loop.<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process.png" alt="Töggelomat process" width="701" height="447" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-300x191.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-1024x653.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-768x489.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-1536x979.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-350x223.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/to%CC%88ggelomat-process-600x382.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px">In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees are converted to Töggelomat players</li>
<li>At the end of a match, the result is written</li>
<li>Scores are calculated from the result</li>

<li>Point changes are applied to the players</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="result"><a id="result"></a>Result</h2>
<p>After two hackathon days and a few beers, the results looked like this, with the main page of the application showing the rank of each player:<br>
<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard.png" alt="Scoreboard" width="859" height="455" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard.png 1999w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-300x159.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-1024x543.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-768x407.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-1536x814.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-350x186.png 350w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/scoreboard-600x318.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px"><br>
Then players are selected and a random match is generated.<br>
<img src="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match.png" alt="Random match" width="843" height="636" srcset="https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match.png 1802w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-300x226.png 300w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-1024x772.png 1024w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-768x579.png 768w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-1536x1158.png 1536w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-348x262.png 348w, https://cdn.confluent.io/wp-content/uploads/random-match-600x452.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 843px) 100vw, 843px"><br>
We expose the data as an “offer,” similar to what we call them in <a href="https://agoora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agoora</a>. The offer has a description as well as the data schema and profile. The profile is useful to data scientists who want to look more closely at the data.<br>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It’s honestly overkill to use so many topics for such a small use case, but the main point was to learn something, and we did! First of all, Quarkus is awesome and could really be the next Spring Boot. It’s a perfect match for Kafka and the cloud in general. Its reactive nature really helps when writing an event-driven application. Plus, its startup time and low memory footprint are better than that of a standard Java application.</p>
<p>Ever since the hackathon, SPOUD has been integrating Quarkus more and more. KsqlDB is also really great and easy to use. It gives you the sense of a database management system (DBMS), but you are in fact working with event streams.</p>
<p>At the same time, you can even join streams! Isn’t that awesome? Think about all the possibilities! Yet, our use case also highlighted some pain points. For example, there is a loop, the match score is dependent on the player’s ranking, and the ranking is also influenced by the score. In a DBMS, you have a defined state at any moment, and all changes in the state are ensured by transactions. Although this makes ensuring consistency easier, events give you the flexibility to scale. For this particular use case, there is at most one match every five minutes, so the loop has the time to complete before the next match. With time-sensitive use cases, you want to avoid loops as much as possible.</p>
<p>The use case presented in this blog post used <a href="http://confluent.io/confluent-cloud">Confluent Cloud</a>, which was inexpensive since there wasn’t a lot of data.</p>

<p>Confluent also allows you to leverage ksqlDB as a service, although in our case the lowest instance available was bigger than what we were looking for. And because an SLA wasn’t essential for our use case, we decided to run our own ksqlDB server based on the documentation and using the Docker image from Confluent.</p>
<h2 id="next"><a id="next"></a>What’s next?</h2>
<p>Now that this project works we can think of what’s next? Here are some additional ideas that we could implement based on the modularity of dedicated topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time game information (e.g., a dashboard on a screen)</li>
<li>Slack integration</li>
<li>Achievements</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I built a financial index that <strong>rates data sets</strong> by their markets' performance (<strong>liquidity</strong> and <strong>equality of liquidity shares</strong>). <strong>Check out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">website</a></strong> and the minimalistic <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/changelog.txt">blog</a>, or keep on reading the article.</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/rugpullindex.png" alt="A screenshot of the
rugpullindex.com website"></p>
<h2 id="why-building-a-data-set-index">Why Building a Data Set Index?</h2>
<p><strong>Would you pay a stranger on the internet</strong> to buy a data set they're offering without knowing them or ever having seen the data? Tough decision! But that's precisely the type of situation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> users face in its newly-launched decentralized <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">data set market</a> [3].</p>
<p>I'll spare you most of the details of how it all works and say this: 2020's most transforming technology has been <strong>on-chain markets</strong>. In particular, the implementation that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://uniswap.org/">uniswap.org</a> is using called <strong>automated market makers</strong>.</p>
<p>Simply put, they work by incentivizing users to <em>pool</em> a pair of assets at a ratio they deem as the assets' current prices. These users, I herein call them <strong>liquidity providers</strong>, e.g., pool 1 ETH and 540 USDC, so that when a buyer of either asset comes along, they can immediately trade 1 ETH for 540 USDC or 540 USDC for 1 ETH. This principle works fantastically at scale, as the pool incentivizes liquidity-providing by charging buyers and sellers a small fee, which is distributed by the pool to each liquidity provider, respectively [1].</p>
<p><img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/marketmakers.png"></p>
<p>This model has been so successful that there've been days where decentralized trading on Uniswap outperformed volumes on Coinbase! Which, of course, has lots of implications on the cryptocurrency space. I think it's no overstatement to say that automated market makers may be <strong>the killer app for crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>But there's one implication I've been particularly keen on exploring: all <strong>the openly-accessible data produced by on-chain markets</strong>. See, if you ever tried building a trading bot, you'll have noticed the terrible resolution publicly-available market data has. You might have also noticed that it's quite difficult even to find data at all. It's not by accident. <strong>Trading data is valuable</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rating-a-data-set-by-its-markets-performance">Rating a Data Set by its Market's Performance</h2>
<p>Remember when I asked you at the beginning of this article about <strong>buying a data set from a random stranger on the internet?</strong> Well, it turns out that Ocean Protocol is now betting on the same technology that made Uniswap successful. They allow users to publish a data set, along with a fungible <strong>data token</strong> and an integrated <strong>automated market maker</strong>. Meaning, you can now buy access to a data set by purchasing tokens. These tokens get priced by liquidity providers providing a ratio of OCEAN Tokens to <em>data tokens</em>.</p>
<p>However, just because data sets are now available for sale on the market, doesn't mean you know they're valuable! After all, if ebay.com didn't have a rating system for sellers, how would you know which seller to trust?</p>
<p>On ebay.com, you know which seller to trust because you can see how many articles they've sold and what each buyer's experience was. It's a simple identity-based rating system.</p>
<p>But within the anarchistic world of cryptocurrencies, there are no working identity-based rating systems! Instead, the space is filled with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sock_puppet_account">sock puppets</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">sybils</a>. <strong>Then, without buying a data set first, how are we supposed to know if a data set is valuable or an outright scam?</strong></p>
<h2 id="introducing-rugpullindex.com">Introducing rugpullindex.com</h2>
<p>That's where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> comes into play. <strong>We crawl all of Ocean Protocol's data token pools daily</strong> and rate each market's liquidity provider distribution by its equality using the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini coefficient</a>. While ranking markets based on their liquidity is common industry-practice, calculating a Gini score for each market's liquidity provider shares isn't. The idea behind this is that the more liquidity providers with an equal share back an asset in the market, the less likely it is for a "rug pull" attack to happen (details <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/multi-repo-issue/issues/30#issuecomment-726132174">here</a>). By factoring in a pool's relative liquidity, it allows us to derive a score <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>100</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 &lt; s &lt; 100</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>For users of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>, this <strong>yields a few attractive benefits</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can now choose to adjust their data set investments based on market data.</li>
<li>They can decide to invest in data sets relative to their performance on to <em>increase their diversivication and hence lower their exposure risk</em>. And finally;</li>
<li>If they're unsure about <strong>sending a random stranger on the internet money for a data set</strong>, they can check out the data set's market performance to make an informed decision.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a widely-known fact that index-based investment yields superior results compared to stock picking [2]. The same is true when <em>investing</em> in data, which makes me excited about working on this project.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What Does The Future Hold?</h2>
<p>I have many ideas for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a> and not as much time as I'd like to have. However, my overarching goal is to make the ranking so reliable that I can build a smart contract-based index fund on top of it.</p>
<p>I think that rating assets based on their markets' performance is valuable occupation in itself. Not only within the data set market but beyond. I'm particularly interested in rating a wide range of on-chain asset markets, but I'm also thinking about rating more on-chain intellectual property markets. I'm eager to crawl more data and explore. Until then, I hope you're having fun using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rugpullindex.com/">rugpullindex.com</a>.</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://www.jotaen.net/9zRPA/klog-time-tracking-plain-textfiles/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jotaen.net/9zRPA/klog-time-tracking-plain-textfiles/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <main>
      

      <p>One topic that kept me thinking on and off for a couple of years now is time tracking. That is for very practical reasons, as I was (and still am) interested to keep track of my working hours. Back in the day, when I used to work full-time, I wanted to know how well on track I was with the 40&nbsp;hours that I agreed to devote to my employer. Nowadays, as a freelancer, I need to log my working hours for bookkeeping reasons, as my invoices are based on an hourly rate.</p>

<p>There exist countless web services for time tracking, some of which offering an impressive feature set that cater for all imaginable use-cases. However, I never felt too much appeal to use them. It’s not that I have any special requirements or practice an extravagant workflow. My reluctance is instead stemming from a conceptual thought: keeping track of times is a rather mundane and simple thing to do, so why rely on (semi-) commercial online services that build on complex technology stacks for something that you can basically do with a pencil and a piece of paper?</p>

<p>What did the trick somewhat well for me throughout the years was a spreadsheet that I setup and maintained by hand. It allowed me to enter data quickly and I could also run some simple evaluations, e.g. in order to aggregate the entries by week or month. While this solution was both simple and flexible, it also felt a bit cumbersome, especially for things like writing more sophisticated formulas or configuring pivot tables. As luck would have it I am in the fortunate position of being able to build my own tools. But before we get to this I need to share another thing with you first.</p>

<p>The longer I have been working with computers the more I appreciate the freedom and simplicity of plain text files: not being bound to proprietary software for opening or editing them; not being exposed to the risk that your data gets sold to advertising companies; no lock-in on arbitrary subscription plans; no connectivity issues that would prevent or slow down access. Instead, the data is just there, it’s all yours and you can rest assured that you will be able to work with it for decades to come. Viewing or manipulating the files can be done with any off-the-shelf text editor, and syncing them across multiple devices is as easy as putting them into your Dropbox folder. While plain-text formats don’t work for each and every application obviously, they seem to be a more than reasonable choice for this task here.</p>

<p>Born out of this conception I experimented with different formats to record time tracking data using plain text files. Over the past weeks I tried out various structures to model and layout the information. What I came up with is a lightweight format with minimal syntax that I called “klog”. The idea is to record the data in a similar style as you would using a physical notebook: it’s basically the date, then time-related entries such as a time range or duration of how long something took, and maybe a short note about what you did.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jotaen.net/posts/2021-01-31-klog/demo.gif" alt="A terminal window demonstrating the file format and the command line tool usage"></p>

<p>I implemented a parser for the klog file format along with a small command line tool that allows to evaluate the data programatically. You find the project <a href="https://github.com/jotaen/klog">on Github</a>, where you can also download the binary in order to experiment with klog. If you happen to be interested in this idea I’d appreciate some feedback and learn about your use-cases – drop me an <a href="https://www.jotaen.net/mail">email</a> or open an issue on Github. klog obviously fits <em>my</em> needs, but I aimed for making it general-purpose enough so that other people may find it useful too.</p>

<p>Building klog was not just a fun programming exercise, I also ran into some interesting questions along the way: is it necessary to support timezones? Is it okay to restrict time values to hours and minutes, but to omit the seconds part for convenience? What if someone starts an activity close to midnight and finishes it on the next day, like working a night shift? Which of the numerous date and time notations need to be understood? How can you start tracking something that’s not yet finished and therefore doesn’t have an end time? I wrote a brief guide (that you find in the repository) that gives a tour of klog and also covers these questions.</p>

<p>The command line tool is fairly minimalistic for now, as I first and foremostly want to validate that my basic idea sustains before investing more work into it. The cli tool has read-only functionality so far and can basically pretty-print, filter and evaluate files. I attributed special attention to error handling, so in case there are formatting errors you should see precise and (hopefully) helpful error messages. The application is written in Go, which ensures that it runs cross-platform without relying on runtime dependencies, and – as a bonus – it’s also quite fast even on large data sets.</p>

<p>And as for the name, “klog” is what we call a “Kofferwort” in German: since my original use-case was tracking work times it is a blend of the two terms “work” and “log”.</p>

                            <p>This article aims to provide a fair and thorough comparison of the current private messaging apps in terms of their privacy, security, and anonymity†. However, it must be abundantly clear that this post is written by Status (one of the above messengers). We strongly encourage you to verify our sources, do your own due diligence, and correct us if we are wrong.</p><p><em>†For the purposes of simplicity for the average reader, anonymity will be defined as a complete dissociation of one's chat identity and their true identity.</em></p><h2 id="signal"><strong>Signal</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-signal-servers-see">What can Signal servers see?</h3><p>Not much. Your messages, attachments, calls, sender metadata, group chats and group metadata are all end-to-end encrypted. However, Signal (and Amazon) can infer who talks to who with a fair degree of accuracy by analyzing the network traffic. Signal is the only entity that runs the Signal servers, and <a href="https://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/">they host all such servers on Amazon Web Services</a>. Here is a simple breakdown of what the network traffic could look like if Alice (1.1.1.1) sent a message to Bob (2.2.2.2):</p><p><strong>08:23:02</strong> — IP Address 1.1.1.1 sends 512 bytes to Signal's server.</p><p><strong>08:23:04</strong> — IP Address 2.2.2.2 receives 512 bytes from Signal's server.</p><p>This is what Jeff Bezos can see. Now, this, on its own, doesn't necessarily mean that Alice is talking to Bob. It could just be a coincidence — Bob happened to receive a different and entirely unrelated packet two seconds after Alice sent one of equal size.</p><p>However, if this coincidence were to happen, ten, twenty or a hundred times, with packets of equal sizes going back and forth from Alice and Bob, it would soon become apparent that these two IP addresses are likely talking to each other. At this point, one simply has to ask the respective Internet Service Provider (such as Comcast or AT&amp;T) who is behind a given IP address to uncover their legal identity.</p><p>So basically, Jeff Bezos can know who you talk to on Signal with a fair degree of accuracy via traffic analysis. This can be done even without Signal's cooperation, as Amazon has direct access to all incoming and outgoing traffic on the centralized Signal servers. In fact, Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal, <a href="https://youtu.be/Nj3YFprqAr8?t=2034">acknowledged this flaw in the Q&amp;A session</a> of his 36C3 talk "The ecosystem is moving."</p><p>If Signal were to cooperate in such traffic analysis attacks, it would become much easier, as Signal does have access to the recipient metadata (<a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">but not sender metadata</a>). In other words, they can see who the envelope is addressed to, but not who it came from. This, in addition to the traffic analysis, would allow Signal to infer nearly all the sender/recipient metadata, in addition to some of the group metadata.</p><h3 id="is-signal-anonymous">Is Signal anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, Signal will leak your IP address to your contacts that call you by default (you can change this in the settings by enabling the option "Always Relay Calls"). Signal also has the technical capability of associating your IP address and your Signal account (<a href="https://signal.org/bigbrother/">but they probably don't do this</a>). This means that even a burner number isn't enough for total anonymity if you assume the Signal servers are malicious or compromised.<br></p><p>It is worth noting that Signal has never claimed to be an anonymous tool. These points do not detract from the fact that they do care about your privacy — they are simply approaching it in a different manner.</p><h3 id="is-signal-easy-to-shut-down">Is Signal easy to shut down?</h3><p>If you don't have any faith in the US government, the answer is yes. If you do, the answer is probably not. Signal is the sole operator of the Signal servers, and they are based in the United States. There is no federation, and there is no peer-to-peer architecture. If Signal is legally compelled to shut down their servers, that's it. All forms of communication through Signal would immediately halt. However, the likelihood of such an event is debatable, and will be left to the reader.</p><p>It would be very difficult to quickly move Signal to a different jurisdiction, as they have thus far operated under the assumption that the US will not ban them. Moxie Marlinspike lives in the US, as does the overwhelming majority of Signal's employees, and their only two legal entities <a href="https://signal.org/legal/">were incorporated in the US</a>. In addition, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Signal themselves could shut down Signal (this may seem obvious, but certain decentralized architectures prevent even the creator of something from shutting it down, such as Bitcoin).</p><hr><h2 id="telegram"><strong>Telegram</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-telegram-servers-see">What can Telegram servers see?</h3><p>Basically everything. They can see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/710344/psa-telegram-chats-arent-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default/">every message you've ever sent in a group chat</a>, most of your 1:1 conversations (not secret chats), all your contacts, your profile picture and your bio. They know who you talk to, and at what time (even if it's a secret chat!). They know the members, name, and icon of every single group (including private ones) .</p><p>This may sound completely contrary to what Telegram says. The reason is that Telegram fundamentally operates on a different trust model. They assume that you trust Telegram, but not the government.</p><p>Telegram splits up their encryption keys and stores the separate pieces in several different jurisdictions. In theory, this means that all of the jurisdictions used by Telegram would have to cooperate in order to obtain any user data. They claim this has allowed them to <a href="https://telegram.org/faq#q-do-you-process-data-requests">not release a single byte of user data</a>. These claims, by their very nature, are unverifiable, and require that you trust Telegram. If that's good enough for you, use Telegram.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-anonymous">Is Telegram anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust Telegram, then Telegram can be anonymous, as you are given the option hide your phone number and use a username of your choice. If you don't trust Telegram, it is not anonymous in any way, as they will have your phone number and <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#5-2-safety-and-security">they can see your IP address</a>.</p><h3 id="is-telegram-easy-to-shut-down">Is Telegram easy to shut down?</h3><p>Probably not. Telegram intentionally set up its legal structure to be agile and resistant to overreaching governments. If Dubai (<a href="https://telegram.org/privacy#8-2-telegrams-group-companies">their current jurisdiction</a>) bans them, they would likely move to another. Dubai is a flag of convenience for Telegram. However, given the centralized nature of their server architecture, Telegram themselves could shut down Telegram.</p><hr><h2 id="whatsapp"><strong>WhatsApp</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-whatsapp-servers-see">What can WhatsApp servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private group, the group icon, the group name, and which members are the administrators of said group. But your messages, pictures, attachments, status updates and calls are all end-to-end encrypted.</p><p>However, it is very important to note that the end-to-end encryption of WhatsApp messages has been repeatedly compromised through <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/04/whatsapp-backups-android/">unencrypted Google or iCloud backups</a>. Although these backups are technically optionally, they are repeatedly suggested to the user with a coercive user interface. Even if you do not enable these backups, there is a good chance your conversation partner did, which compromises the integrity of the end-to-end encryption for both of you.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-anonymous">Is WhatsApp anonymous?</h3><p>No. You are required to provide your phone number — which, in many parts of the world, is synonymous with providing your government-issued ID. In addition, WhatsApp <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en">logs your IP address</a> and directly associates it with your chat identity.</p><h3 id="is-whatsapp-easy-to-shut-down">Is WhatsApp easy to shut down?</h3><p>Not really, given the scale of Facebook and the nature of public corporations. However, it is very likely that WhatsApp could be forced to include a backdoor into their clients. There would be no way around this, as the clients are all proprietary. With all other messaging apps in this list, one could simply download the code prior to the backdoor, build it, and run that version of the client which still correctly encrypts the messages. Decentralized messaging architectures such as Status or Matrix would be even more resilient against such coercion, as there would be no central servers to shut down.</p><hr><h2 id="matrix"><strong>Matrix</strong><br></h2><h3 id="what-can-federated-matrix-servers-see">What can federated Matrix servers see?</h3><p>All the metadata, but none of the content. They can see your profile picture, your private room aliases, your device names, who you talk to, and when. They can see who is a member of a given private room, the room icon, the room name, and which members are the administrators of said room. They can see who talks and when in private rooms. But your messages, pictures and files are all end-to-end encrypted by default.</p><p>Although some homeserver implementations have <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4565#issuecomment-540320761">stopped storing this metadata by default</a>, all homeservers still have the technical ability to access it. Some of these metadata issues may be resolved with the latest developments in <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix">P2P Matrix</a>, but it is unclear as to whether or not this will be effective in regards to room metadata such as membership or administrator privileges.</p><p>It should be noted that the relative ease of hosting your own Matrix server diminishes the value of any metadata leaks. If all of your contacts use a Matrix server that you trust (which could be one that you host), it doesn't matter if the server can see this metadata. However, in practice, most people just use someone else's server (such as the matrix.org one).</p><h3 id="is-matrix-anonymous">Is Matrix anonymous?</h3><p>Kinda. If you trust the federated homeserver you are connected to not to disclose your IP address, you are anonymous. If not, you are not anonymous, as the homeserver you connect to will be able to directly associate <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/f31f8e63198cfe46af48d788dbb294aba9155e5a/synapse/storage/databases/main/schema/delta/16/users.sql#L42">your chat identity and IP</a>.</p><p>Although it technically is possible to host a Matrix homeserver as an anonymous Tor onion service, it is highly impractical to do so as the process has <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7088">yet to be streamlined</a>.</p><h3 id="is-matrix-easy-to-shut-down">Is Matrix easy to shut down?</h3><p>No. It would be practically impossible to entirely shut Matrix down. The Matrix Foundation cannot shut down Matrix. However, significant damage could be done given the current points of centralization. First, if the …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>I believe the book we should be recommending is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> by John Ousterhout.  In this post I want to spend a bit of time reviewing it and giving an overview of the contents, and then I want to explain why, in my opinion, it is such a good recommendation.</p>

<p>The elevator pitch of John Ousterhout's book <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em> is fairly simple: he is a university professor (albeit one with almost two decades of experience in the "real world", also the inventor of Tcl, creator of RAFT, company founder amongst <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/lb8zrn/an_alternative_to_clean_code_a_philosophy_of/glt3e4n/">other things</a>), who each year teaches students how to actually design software in a practical, hands-on course where the students are expected to design and modify "a substantial piece of software" in an iterative way, hopefully understanding more about the practice of software design each time around.</p>
<p>The book, then, is a synthesis of the pieces of wisdom that Ousterhout has himself learned from his own experiences, tempered and refined by the practical examples he has been able to draw from his students.  In this way, it has a (somewhat) scientific, research-based approach, where the author's assertions are backed up with examples from student projects that worked (or didn't).</p>
<p>At it's core, though, this is still philosophy - the book doesn't just list the things that worked well, and the things that worked poorly.  Instead, Ousterhout attempts in each chapter to divine broader truths that apply to software design in general.  There are no lists of what to do and what not to do, but instead principles to follow, red flags to be aware of, and warnings against taking anything too far.</p>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The book is split into a series of chapters, each of which generally explores a single principle.  These range from the very high level ("Working Code Isn't Enough", "Modules Should Be Deep") to the more practical questions ("Choosing Names").  The whole book is relatively short (about 180 pages), and many chapters flow together nicely, which means that it's quite easy to go from cover-to-cover, rather than approach the book as a reference manual.  That said, the final pages provide summaries of the design principles and red flags found in the book, making it easy to reference key parts of the book.</p>
<p>Within each chapter, Ousterhout generally starts by stating a problem or motivation that software engineers will face, and then defining a principle to solve this.  The rest of the chapter is then a discussion of the principle, the dangers of alternative approaches, the red flags that indicate that the principle needs to be applied (or in some cases avoided), and some notes about taking ideas too far.</p>
<p>The examples are often based on problems that Ousterhout has given his classes, which means that they generally feel meaty enough to be worth discussing.  An example of a text editor appears in Chapter 6, but is extended in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 10 in different contexts.  Enough is omitted from most examples to make the point clear, but enough is kept in to give the feeling of real code.</p>
<h2 id="ousterhout-s-principles">Ousterhout's Principles</h2>
<p>The overriding theme throughout the book is that good code <em>looks</em> good.  Ousterhout thinks very much in terms of abstraction and interfaces - where "interfaces" refers to the contact points between different units of abstraction, rather than any similarly-named construct in any particular language.  Most of the book is dedicated to figuring out how to spot bad abstractions and rework them into good abstractions.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this feels at odds with certain common mantras in software engineering circles today, where we encourage enough other to Keep It Simple, Stupid, and worry about premature abstractions.  <em>Philosophy</em> seems to worry less about the dangers of over-abstraction, and more concerned with how to make sure that the chosen abstraction is a good one.</p>
<p>This approach makes for a more positive experience than in many other programming circles - rather than being warned into a very conservative approach, Ousterhout encourages his readers to go out and make abstractions, but to be careful about designing the correct ones.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that the book isn't also cautionary - in the summary pages at the back, the list of red flags gets more page space than the list of principles, and throughout the book these red flags mark out moments when readers are given the go ahead to use these abstraction techniques.  There are also warnings about when a principle might be used too much.</p>
<h2 id="everyone-s-a-critic">Everyone's a Critic</h2>
<p>Beyond the mild danger of encouraging excess abstraction, the biggest issue in <em>Philosophy</em> is probably the missing parts - the topic of testing gets a single page in Chapter 19 (Software Trends), and ideas about effective use of a type system to avoid issues are largely ignored.  Ousterhout's principles will still apply in these areas, but it would be nice to see some more specific discussion of these areas.</p>
<h2 id="the-target-audience">The Target Audience</h2>
<p>It can be a bit unclear at times to whom Ousterhout writes.  A lot of the examples clearly relate to his students, and the projects that they come from have a somewhat academic feel - a text editor here, and an HTTP protocol parser there.  The code in the examples is generally object-oriented (Java and occasional C++), although it generally feels like it could be replaced with most imperative/OO languages without much of an effect.</p>
<p>The use of the phrase "software design" might make one think more of broader software architecture, but Ousterhout uses it more to describe the design of individual modules and functions <em>within</em> a program, rather than the broader architecture of the program itself (although he occasionally touches on that).</p>
<p>More functionally-minded people might think they can simply side-step a lot of the discussion here, in the same way that they can when discussing the Gang of Four's design patterns, but the principle "design errors out of existence" (Chapter 10) and its corollary "design special cases out of existence" should ring bells for people in this area who are also aware of the principle of making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think this book aims at a space that is slightly deeper than a lot of existing software literature.  Where books like <em>Design Patterns</em>, Fowler's <em>Refactoring</em>, and the aforementioned <em>Clean Code</em> are aimed at more traditional "enterprise" software development, <em>Philosophy</em> feels more widely applicable, albeit at the cost of being more abstract and difficult to apply.</p>
<p>In general, I think <em>Philosophy</em> is a good read if you are both (a) working with software regularly, and (b) conscious of the inherent maintenance cost in software, and aiming to minimise it.</p>
<h2 id="a-book-to-recommend">A Book to Recommend</h2>
<p>The original question I wanted to answer was what we, as software engineers, should recommend over books like <em>Clean Code</em>.  As I said, my answer to that question is <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.</p>
<p>Software engineering (indeed, engineering in general) is not a science, insofar as there are no (or at least very few) exact answers.  Everything from the database you use to your choice of testing strategy will be dependent on the context of the software you're writing.  This means that the advice that we give to each other will probably be very context-specific.  In general, you probably shouldn't use a NoSQL database, but in a lot of specific contexts you probably should.</p>
<p>This isn't a problem if we don't run into these exceptional cases often, but engineering is all about exceptional cases - if there were no exceptional cases, we wouldn't need to write any new software, because our existing tools would do the job.  This is where books like <em>Philosophy</em> come in - rather than give situational advice, it attempts to define wider principles that the reader will then need to apply to different situations.</p>
<p>Take, for example, my favourite principle: "Modules should be deep" (explored in Chapter 4).  The idea is that an individual unit of abstraction should do a lot of work (i.e. be deep, and contain a lot of complexity), but it should have a relatively simple interface (i.e. be narrow).  Essentially, if you're going to abstract something, make sure your abstraction is deep.</p>
<p>Notice that this principle says nothing about functions, classes, lines, blocks, parameters, or anything specific to a single language or paradigm.  However, when we apply it, for example to the Java code Robert C. Martin talks about in <em>Clean Code</em>, we can derive some of his ideas from this principle.  Assuming a function is our unit of abstraction (for now, at least), the parameters are its interface, therefore we should reduce the number of parameters to the minimum necessary.</p>
<p>However, because our principle is more general, we can actually correct some of the mistakes Martin makes.  Martin talks about removing parameters by adding private fields to the class that the method belongs to.  When we think in terms of interfaces, we notice that this <em>hasn't decreased the interface at all</em> - we've lost a parameter, but we've gained a private field, and in the process made things harder for the consumer of our abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-principles-over-rules">Teaching Principles Over Rules</h2>
<p>When I recommend books, I generally hope that the other person will learn something from the book I have suggested.  If I were to recommend <em>Clean Code</em>, I would hope that the reader would learn something about how to write clean Java code, but I suspect they would mainly learn how to write code like Robert C. Martin - or more accurately, like someone copying Robert C. Martin's actions without always understanding why he's taking them.</p>
<p>I do not feel this way about <em>A Philosophy of Software Design</em>.  When I recommend it, I …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>See also: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1616925913">Flash cards (Anki deck) for memorization</a></strong></p>
<p>My team writes a lot of command line tools, and we like to assume that people aren’t using a literal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100">VT100</a> (meaning: we liberally use colours, italics, and basically every other terminal feature available to us). This tends to result in strings in our code that look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>"\x1b[A\r\x1b[K\x1b[1;32mopened \x1b[1;4;34m%s\x1b[0;1;32m in your browser.\x1b[0m\n"</code></pre>
<p>If you’re like most people, your face just melted, but it’s actually really simple. This page is a crash course in what all of these things mean, and how to learn to read and write them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="x1b"><code>\x1b</code></h3>
<p>ANSI escapes always start with <code>\x1b</code>, or <code>\e</code>, or <code>\033</code>. These are all the same thing: they’re just various ways of inserting the byte 27 into a string. If you look at an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a>, <code>0x1b</code> is literally called <code>ESC</code>, and this is basically why.</p>
<h3 id="control-sequences">Control sequences</h3>
<p>The majority of these escape codes start with <code>\x1b[</code>. This pair of bytes is referred to as <code>CSI</code>, or “Control Sequence Introducer”. By and large, a control sequence looks like:</p>
<pre><code>0x1B + "[" + &lt;zero or more numbers, separated by ";"&gt; + &lt;a letter&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It’s helpful to think of it this way: the terminating letter is a function name, and the intervening numbers as function arguments, delimited by semicolons rather than the typical commas.</p>
<p>If you see <code>\x1b[0;1;34m</code>, you can read it like this:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[  # call a function
0;1;34 # function arguments (0, 1, 34)
m      # function name</code></pre>
<p>In effect, this is <code>m(0, 1, 34)</code>. Similarly, <code>\x1b[A</code> is just <code>A()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="available-functions">Available functions</h3>
<p>So with that mental model—reading escape sequences as function invocations—here’s an abridged documentation of the “standard library”, as it were:</p>

<h3 id="sgr">SGR</h3>
<p>The SGR (“Select Graphics Rendition”) function (<code>m</code>) has a much more complex signature than the other functions. An—again, abridged—guide to SGR arguments:</p>

</table>
<p>Multiple SGR arguments can always be concatenated using another <code>;</code>, and they will be applied in the order they are encountered. It’s especially common to see <code>0;</code> before some other argument, in order to reset the state before applying our own.</p>
<h3 id="colour-palettes">Colour Palettes</h3>
<p>The basic colour palette has 8 entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: black</li>
<li>1: red</li>
<li>2: green</li>
<li>3: yellow</li>
<li>4: blue</li>
<li>5: magenta</li>
<li>6: cyan</li>
<li>7: white</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful way to help remember this, or at least to select colours for use, is that, with the exception of 0/black, the colours are ordered by usefulness, with highest first: red text is very useful for indicating failures, green is useful for indicating extreme success, yellow for warnings, and then blue, magenta, and cyan for progressively more obscure conditions or decoration.</p>
<p>0 and 7 are less useful for text because one or the other will generally look nearly-unreadable depending on whether the user has a light or a dark background.</p>
<p>Terminals will also have a “bright” version of this palette (activated using 90–97 / 100–107). These are the same (black/red/green/etc.) but generally noticeably brighter than their regular counterparts.</p>
<p>For practice, you might try to figure out how this string would display:</p>
<pre><code>\x1b[38;2;255;255;0mH\x1b[0;1;3;35me\x1b[95ml\x1b[42ml\x1b[0;41mo\x1b[0m</code></pre>
<h3 id="miscellany">Miscellany</h3>
<p>Another pair of useful escapes is <code>\x1b[?25h</code> and <code>\x1b[?25l</code>. These show and hide the cursor, respectively. Try not to think too hard about the syntax here: <code>?25</code> means something to do with the cursor and <code>h</code> and <code>l</code> stand for “high” and “low”: imagine a bit indicating whether the cursor should be visible. The “high” value (1) would indicate “show”; the “low” value (0) would indicate “hide”.</p>
<p>Show/hide is useful when you’re going to draw some stuff that’ll cause the cursor to jump around like crazy, for example, repainting a couple of the last few lines to update them with new content.</p>
<p>One other thing that we use frequently is <code>\r</code>, or Carriage Return, which is functionally similar or identical to <code>\x1b[1G</code>. It just moves the cursor to the start of the line.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>That was a lot of information, but that’s essentially everything you need to know in order to competently read and write ANSI escape codes in a terminal.</p>

inspired by <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/001749.html">pandagon</a>: a meta-proof of P=/!=NP, coming to a <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;group=comp.theory">newsgroup near you</a>:
</p><p>
P: I would like to announce my proof of P=/!=NP. The proof is very short and demonstrates how to solve/not solve SAT in polynomial time. You may find a write up of the proof <a href="http://">here</a>.
</p><p>
|-- V: I started reading your proof and when you claim 'foobar' do you mean 'foobar' or 'phishbang' ? 
<br>|----P: I meant 'phishbang'. Thanks for pointing that out. An updated version is <a href="http://">here.</a>
<br>|------V: Well if you meant 'phishbang' then statement "in this step we assume the feefum" is incorrect.
<br>|--------P: No no, you don't understand. I can assume feefum because my algorithm has a glemish.
<br>|-----------V: It has a glemish ? !! But having a glemish doesn't imply anything. All algorithms have glemishes !!
<br>|----V': Yes, and in fact in the 3rd step of argument 4, your glemish contradicts the first propum. 
<br>|--V'': I think you need to understand some basic facts about complicity theory before you can go further. Here is a book to read.
<br>|----P: My proof is quite clear, and I don't see why I have to explain it to you if you don't understand. I have spent a long time on this.
<br>|------V': Um, this is a famous problem, and there are many false proofs, and so you do have to convince us that the argument using glemishes can   actually work.
<br>|--------P: But what is wrong in my proof ? I don't see any problems with it, and if you can't point one out, how can you say it is wrong.
<br>|----------V'''': I don't have to read the entire proof: glemished algorithms are well known not to work.
<br>|------------V'''''': Check out this reference by </p><well known="" person=""> to see why.
<br>P: &lt;silence&gt;
<br>|--P: &lt;answering earlier post&gt;. This is what I mean by a glemish. it is really a flemish, not a glemish, which answers your objection.
<br>|----P': Keep up the good work P. I tried publishing my result, and these people savaged my proof without even trying to identify a problem. All great mathematical progress has come from amateurs like us. See this <a href="http://">link</a> of all the theorems proved by non-experts.
<br>|------V': Oh jeez, not P' again. I thought we had established that your proof was wrong.
<br>|--------P': no you didn't: in fact I have a new version that explains the proof in such simple language even dumb&amp;%&amp;%s like you can get it.
<br>|------P: Thanks P', I understand that there will be resistance from the community since I have proved what they thought to be so hard. 
<br>|--V': P, I'm trying to understand your proof, with the flemishes, and it seems that maybe there is a problem in step 517 with the brouhaha technique.
<br>P: &lt;silence&gt;
<br>|----P: V', thanks for pointing out that mistake. you are right. Instead of a brouhaha technique I need a slushpit. The details are complicated, so I will fix it and post a corrected version of the proof shortly. Thanks to all those who gave me constructive advice. I am glad that at least some of you have an open mind to accept new ideas. 
<hr>
<p>
This was prompted by the latest P=NP fiasco on comp.theory. I can only express my amazement and wonder at the few tireless souls (and they seem to be the same ones) who patiently try to address each new crackpot proof that comes down the pipe.

<p>A <strong>cold path</strong> is a path through the code or situation that rarely happens. By contrast,

found in a path colder than all the paths you tested.</p>

<p>Here are some real world “cold paths” with big consequences:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://blog.thousandeyes.com/impacts-expired-tls-certificate/">An outage caused by an expired TLS certificate</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Rare events are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness-Fragility/dp/081297381X">hard to predict</a>. That’s just the nature of them. As engineers,
I belive it’s our responsibility to do our best to try harder and get better at planning for
these rare bugs. Is that it? Try harder?</p>

<p>Better: Don’t have cold paths</p>


<p>I watched one of Gil Tene’s many amazing talks on Azul’s C4 garbage collector (not <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Java-GC-Azul-C4/">this talk</a>,
but similar) where he claimed that normally it takes 10 years to harden a garbage
collector. Azul didn’t have 10 years to produce a viable business, so they avoided almost all
cold paths in the collector and they were able to harden it in 4 years (I never tried verifying
this claim).</p>

<p>For a garbage collector, this means things like offering fewer options, or having a simpler
model to avoid cold paths around promoting objects between generations. For your app it will
mean something different.</p>

<p>You can <strong>test less</strong> to achieve high quality by <strong>reducing the size</strong> of your application. 
Less edge cases is equivalent to less testing surface area, which implies less testing work
and fewer missed test cases. There’s something to be said for avoiding config options and
making solutions less generic.</p>


<p>While I worked at AWS I had this beaten into my skull, but thankfully they’ve published 
guidence an excellent piece titled <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/avoiding-fallback-in-distributed-systems/?did=ba_card&amp;trk=ba_card">“avoiding fallback in distributed systems”</a>. The 
hope is that, when system 1 fails you would like to automatically fallback to system 2.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we have a process that sends logs to another service. For the hot 
path, we send logs directly via an HTTP request. But if the log service fails (e.g. 
overloaded, maintenence, etc.) we fallback by writing to a file and have a secondary process 
send those logs to the service when it comes back.</p>

<ul>
  <li>System 1: directly send logs to server</li>
  <li>System 2: send asynchronously via file append</li>
</ul>

<p>If system 2 is more reliable than system 1, then why don’t we always choose system 2? 
Always write to the file and ship logs asynchronously rather than send directly to the 
server. This is surprisingly strong logic that isn’t considered often enough. More often,
by asking the question you end up finding a way to make system 1 more robust.</p>

<p>In cases where fallback can’t be avoided they suggest always exercising the fallback. 
For example, on every request, randomly decide to use either system 1 or system 2, 
thereby ensuring that the cold path isn’t cold because both are exercised on the hot path,
at least sometimes.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://danluu.com/deconstruct-files/">“files are fraught with problems”</a>, Dan Luu demonstrates that it’s unexpectedly
difficult to write a file to disk correctly. Juggling issues like handling random power loss or 
strange ext4 behavior becomes a full-time job. It’s a lot to keep in your head, just to 
write a file.</p>

<p>Is it better to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ignore the cold paths and hope for the best</li>
  <li>Correctly implement &amp; test each file write event and ship late</li>
  <li>Use a system that does it correctly for you, like MySQL or SQLite</li>
</ol>

<p>Choice #3 delegates the testing of all those pesky cold paths to a 3rd party. 
Therefore, #3 is always the best choice, unless your company is in the file writing 
business (e.g. you’re AWS and working on DynamoDB or S3).</p>

<p>Alternnate take on the same idea: <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose boring technology</a></p>


<p>The practice of avoiding cold paths is often presented as “simple code”. Unfortunately, “simple”
has such wildly varying meanings that it’s often antagonistic to use it outside a
mathematical setting. I’ve found that centering conversations around “avoiding cold paths”
gives more clarity on how to proceed.</p>

<p>In system design, the conversation about what is “simple” is even tougher due to the 
amorphous nature of it. The principle of “avoiding cold paths” can be extended to mean,
“delegating cold paths” to a trusted third party, like an open source project or a cloud
provider. An earnest discussion about your capacity for testing might be
appropriate. It lets you disengage from “building cool stuff” and instead view it as
“testing burden I’d rather not have”.</p>

    <p>If you have a software background and you want to pick up digital design,
then one of the first things you need to learn about early on is the concept
of the clock.  To many software engineers turned beginning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">Hardware Description Language
(HDL)</a>
designers, the concept of a clock is an annoyance.  Without using a
clock, they can turn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
into a programming language–with $display’s, <code>if</code>’s,
and <code>for</code> loops like any other programming language.  Yet the clock that these
beginning designers ignore is often the most fundamental part of any digital
design.</p>

<p>This difficulty is never more present then when reviewing some of the first
designs that beginning
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
developers produce.  I’ve now talked with several of these individuals who
have posted questions on the forums I participate within.  When I’ve then
drilled down into what they are doing, I’ve had to cringe at what I’ve found.</p>

<p>As an example, one student came to me struggling to understand why no one
on-line seemed to think much of his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
implementation.
I’ll spare him the embarrassment of being named, or of linking to his project.
Instead, I’m just going to call him a <em>student</em>.  (No, <a href="https://zipcpu.com/about">I’m not a
professor</a>.)
This “student” had created a Verilog design to do not one round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
encryption, but <em>every round</em>, <em>all in combinatorial logic with no clocks</em> in
between.  I can’t remember if he was doing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-128,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-192, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>-256,
but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
requires between 10 and 14 rounds.  As I recall, his encryption engine
worked perfectly in the simulator, yet it only used one clock to encrypt or
decrypt his data.  He was proud of his work, but couldn’t understand why
those who looked at it told him he was thinking like a software engineer,
and not like a hardware designer.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 1: Software is Sequential</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/sw-is-serial.svg" alt="Software runs serially" width="128"></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Indeed, I’ve now had the opportunity to counsel many of these software
engineers, new to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>,
like this “student”.  Many of them like to treat
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a> like
just another <em>software programming</em> language.  Having programmed before, they
go and look for the basics in any software programming language: how to
declare variables, how to make an if statement, a case statement, how to write
loops, etc.  They then write their code like a computer program–where
everything needs to run sequentially (Fig 1), yet completely ignoring the
reality of digital design which is that everything runs in parallel.</p>

<p>Sometimes these programmers will find a simulator, such as
<a href="https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator">Verilator</a>,
<a href="http://iverilog.icarus.com/">iverilog</a>,
or the
<a href="https://www.edaplayground.com/">EDA playground</a>.
They’ll then use a bunch of <code>$display</code> commands in their logic, treat them like
sequential “printf”s and use them to get their code to work–<em>without using
a clock</em>.  Their design then “runs” in the simulator using combinatorial logic
alone.</p>

<p>These students then describe their designs to me, and explain to me that their
design “works without a clock”.</p>

<p>Say what?</p>

<p>The reality is that no digital logic design can work “without a clock”.
There is always some physical process creating the
inputs.  These inputs must all be valid at some start time–this time forms the
first clock “tick” in their design.  Likewise, the outputs are then required
from those inputs some time later.  The time when all the outputs are
valid given for a given set of inputs forms the next “clock” in a “clockless”
design.  Perhaps the first clock “tick” is when the set the last switch on
their board is adjusted and the last clock “tick” is when their eye reads the
result.  It doesn’t matter: there is a clock.</p>

<p>The result is that someone who claims that their design “has no clock” is
either stating that he is using the simulator in an unrealistic fashion, or
that the design has an external clock setting the inputs and reading the
outputs–which is another way of saying that the design really <em>does</em> have
a clock.</p>

<p>If you find yourself struggling to understand the necessity of having a clock
when working in digital logic, or if you know someone who might be struggling
with this concept, then this post is for you.</p>

<p>Let’s spend a moment or two discussing the clock, and why it is so important
to build and design your logic around a clock.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-hardware-design-is-parallel-design">Lesson #1: Hardware design is parallel design</h2>

<p>The first and perhaps most difficult part of learning hardware design is
to learn that all hardware design is parallel design.  Things don’t take
place serially, as in one instruction after another (Fig 1), like they do in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">computer</a>.
Instead, everything happens at once, as in Fig 2.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 2: Hardware logic runs in Parallel</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/hw-is-parallel.svg" alt="Hardware runs in parallel" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>This changes a <em>lot</em> of things.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 3: A software loop</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/sw-loop.svg" alt="Figure of a software loop" width="200"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The first thing that changes needs to be the developer.  You need to <a href="https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/21/rules-for-newbies.html">learn to
<em>think</em> in
parallel</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps a good example of this difference would be a hardware loop.</p>

<p>In software, a loop consists of a series of
instructions, as Fig 3 illustrates.  These instructions create a set of
initial conditions.  Logic is then performed within the loop.  Then a loop
variable is used to make and define this logic, and it is often incremented
each time through the loop.  Until the
loop variable reaches the termination condition, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">CPU</a>
continues to repeat
the instructions and logic within the loop.  The more times the loop runs,
the longer it takes to run the program.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
based hardware loops are not like this at all.  Instead, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">HDL</a>
synthesis
tool uses the loop description to make several copies of the logic all
running in parallel.  The logic used to create the loop, such as the index,
to increment that index, to check the index against the final condition, etc.,
doesn’t need to be synthesized–so it is usually removed.  Further, since
the synthesis tool is creating physical wires and logic blocks, the number
of times through the loop cannot change after synthesis time.  After that
time, the amount of hardware is fixed and can no longer be changed.</p>

<p>The structure that results, shown in Fig 4 below, is <em>very</em> different from
the structure of a software loop in Fig 3 above.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 4: An HDL generated loop</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/hw-loop.svg" alt="Figure of an HDL generated loop" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>This has several consequences.  For example, loop iterations can’t necessarily
depend upon the output of prior loop iterations like they could in software.
As a result, it’s hard to run a loop of logic across all of the data in a set
have an answer in the next clock.</p>

<p>But … now we’ve come back to the concept of the clock again.</p>

<p>The clock is central to any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>
design.  Everything revolves around it.
Indeed, I would argue that all of your logic development should <em>start</em> with
the clock.  It’s not an afterthought, but rather the clock forms the
structure of how you think about digital design in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-clock-is-important">Why the clock is important</h2>

<p>Step one is to understand that everything within a digital logic design takes
time to do in hardware.  Not only that, but
different operations take different amounts of time.  Traveling from one
part of the chip to another also takes time.</p>

<p>Perhaps the way to visualize this is with a chart.  Let’s place the
inputs to our algorithm on the top, the logic in the middle, and the outputs
on the bottom.  Time, as an axis, will run from top to bottom, from one clock
to the next.  The result of this visualization might look something like
Fig 5, below.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 5: Logic takes time, three operations</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/clk-poor-design.svg" alt="Figure showing several logic operations, and their impact on the clock rate" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Fig 5 shows several different operations: an addition, a multiply, and several
rounds of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>–although
for discussion purposes it could be several rounds of any algorithm.
I’ve used the size of the operation boxes, in the vertical direction, to
indicate notionally how much time each operation might require.  Further,
operations that depend upon other operations stack up.  Hence, if you want
to do many rounds of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> within
one clock, you’ll need to know that the second round cannot begin until
the first is complete.  Fitting this logic in, therefore, will increase the
amount of time between clock ticks and slow down your overall clock rate.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at the pink boxes.</p>

<p>The pink boxes represent the wasted capacity in your hardware
circuit–times when you might have been able to do something,
but since you had to wait for the clock, or perhaps wait for your inputs
to be processed first, you couldn’t do anything.  For example, in our notional
diagram above the multiply doesn’t take as long as one round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
neither does the addition.  However, you can’t do anything with the results
of those two operations while the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
calculations are taking place since those operations need to wait for
the next clock to get their next inputs.  This is what the “pink” boxes
represent in Fig 5: idle circuitry.  Further, because all of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
rounds are pushing the next clock into the distance, there’s a lot of
idle circuitry presented in Fig 5.  This design, therefore, will not run as
fast as the hardware would allow.</p>

<p>If all we did was pipeline the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
algorithm, so that one round could be calculated on every clock, we could
then get the entire design to run faster with less wasted capacity.</p>

<p>Fig 6 shows this idea.</p>

<table><caption>Fig 6: Breaking up the operations speeds up the clock</caption><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://zipcpu.com/img/clk-aes-better.svg" alt="Figure: several operations, with immediate results between each" width="780"></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>As a result of breaking our operation up into smaller operations, each of
which could be accomplished between clock ticks, our design now has much
less wasted capacity.  Even better, instead of encrypting only one block
of data at a time, we can pipeline the encryption algorithm.  The resulting
logic won’t encrypt a single block any faster than Fig 5 above, but if you
can keep the pipeline full you should be able to increase your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
encryption throughput by somewhere between 10-14x faster.</p>

<p>This is therefore a better design.</p>

<p>Can we do better?  Indeed we could!  If you are familiar with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
then you know that each round of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>,
has discrete steps within it.  These
can be broken up, allowing us to increase our clock speed until the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
round logic takes less time than the multiply.  This will increase the number
of adds and multiplies you can do, as well as micro-pipelining your
encryption engine so that you can run even more data through it on a per
clock basis.</p>

<p>Not bad.</p>

<p>February 2021</p>

<p>Last week’s GameStop (GME) speculative frenzy stirred a motley crew  of Redditors, politicians, and venture capitalists, each using the volatility to push their preferred narratives. <em>Evil hedge funds are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340">propping up their buddies</a> and astroturfing misinformation. Market makers are evil for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-frenzy-puts-spotlight-on-trading-giant-citadel-securities-11612089000">profiting off retail order flow</a>. Robinhood has forsaken its namesake and is in cahoots with the aforementioned parties.</em> There are plenty of villains in this story, or none at all, depending on your view of the financial industry.</p>

<p>The real answer to why Robinhood restricted trading on GME turned out to be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/01/business/us-economy-coronavirus#robinhood-needed-3-billion-to-cover-risky-trades-its-chief-told-elon-musk">far more mundane</a>. To recap, settlement of stock trades takes multiple days, and in the meantime, the clearinghouses that facilitate trades for brokers require that some collateral be placed to account for risk that the buyer or seller does not fulfill their side of the trade. Since this risk increases with stock volatility, clearinghouses demanded $3 billion collateral from Robinhood to account for their users holding GME, a meme stock that was routinely seeing +/- 50% swings but threatened to crash to earth at any moment. Robinhood was forced to deal with the imminent liquidity challenge by raising emergency funding. In the meantime, to manage risk, they placed limits on purchasing GME shares. So goes the story recounted by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev (or as Elon Musk called him, “<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-calls-robinhood-ceo-vlad-the-stock-impaler-and-grills-him-over-the-gamestop-saga-11612180184">Vlad the stock impaler</a>”).</p>

<p>Yet this surface-level explanation likely leaves the observant investor with more questions. <em>Okay, so plausibly if we’re trading on margin, Robinhood could face a liquidity crunch. But what’s the problem if we’re trading using our own settled cash?</em> Cash trades need to settle and we have to put down collateral to insure against risk in the meantime. <em>That’s no problem, the internet enables us to process transactions quickly, right?</em> No, it takes two days. <em>Why does it take two days?</em> Transactions are processed at night in batches. <em>Fine then, can’t you use the money we just put up as collateral?</em> You can’t use client funds for that purpose. <em>Why not? Wait, wouldn’t this all be a non-issue if trades cleared near-instantly? Isn’t this a self-imposed problem within the financial industry?</em></p>

<p>Indeed, this doesn’t seem to be how we would design the system from first principles. As it turns out, Robinhood’s liquidity incident only exposes the surface of deeper troubles in fintech. Underneath a world of seamless consumer transacting represented by Robinhood, Venmo, and other apps of their generation lies an underbelly of interconnected financial systems that struggle to meet modern demands. Fintech’s attempts at abstracting away such complexity run into challenges when long-tail events occur, leaving customers frustrated and institutions in danger. A firmer foundational infrastructure from the Fed involving features like open banking, instant P2P payments, and real-time trade settlement (update: <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/2/its-time-for-real-time-settlement">Robinhood themselves called for this now!</a>) would allow us to build a more robust layer of services while minimizing rent-seeking middlemen. <strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">It’s Time to Build</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="when-abstractions-fail">When Abstractions Fail</h2>

<p>Software engineers define leaky abstractions as when underlying implementation details of a process, meant to be hidden away, become relevant as things fail. From this perspective, Robinhood manifested <strong>an</strong> <strong>abstraction that was not simply leaking but gushing out from every news report</strong> and flooding investors’ brokerage accounts. By hiding the details of a complex settlement process and marking sale proceeds as immediately available to a customer, Robinhood presents a simplified trading process to customers while handling the settlement and margin details behind the scenes. It all works well until some Redditors decide to send a stock to the moon and your platform bears the brunt, I guess. In any case upon discovery of a software bug, it’s an all-too-familiar experience to realize a certain library call isn’t working, and find yourself having to dig further and further into the annals of ancient source code down the chain to figure out where something went wrong.</p>

<p>Since you were never intended to dig this far (you’d never need to, right?), they sure won’t make it easy to dig down there, with obfuscated binaries, hidden state effects, and other nasty monsters of the underworld. Likewise, delving into the GME situation is a hopeless exercise for an average investor who, faced with a sudden message of “trading suspended”, rationally wants to get to the bottom of this. They would quickly find a wall of opaque financial rules with regards to the clearing process that seem to exist on a “need to know’’ basis. If Vlad the CEO himself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M7X2dsW_Xw">“doesn’t quite know how the formula works”</a>, what hope does the average citizen have to track down the source of this seeming bug in the system? Perhaps we should all just give up, raise pitchforks against Citadel, and call it a day.</p>

<p>The financial world is not new to abstractions, of course. Almost any tangible object or collection of intangibles has been securitized, packaged into new securities, tranched once or twice for good measure, and repackaged - repeat until satisfied. New engineered securities are then available for boomer 401k portfolios, sovereign wealth funds, and anyone else who wants in from the peripheries. These abstractions, in their defense, have usually made the markets in which they’re employed <a href="http://www.oeconomia.actapol.net/pub/9_3_181.pdf">far more efficient and liquid</a>. Mortgage-backed securities, as much as they were maligned for their role in precipitating the Great Recession, made it dramatically easier for cash-strapped homebuyers in North Carolina to be matched up with someone on the other side of the world looking to [in theory] buy a bunch of uncorrelated assets (we all know how that ended though) for their investment portfolio. In exchange for the hard work and research that goes into assembling these securities, <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/causes-of-wage-stagnation/">financial middlemen wages have shot up dramatically since 1970</a> against a backdrop of broader economic inequality.</p>

<p>But <strong>abstractions are only useful when they’re built upon a well-designed foundation of primitives</strong>. When abstractions are instead used as patches over flimsy Swiss cheese layers of infrastructure, they’re bound to go wrong and leak, making their presence known to the world at the most inopportune time. Like, say, when GME is attempting to go to the moon but passengers are getting ejected for mysterious reasons. <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">Joel Spolsky’s Law of Leaky Abstractions</a> asserts that “All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.” Assuming the truth of this statement, building unnecessary layers of complex abstractions compounds the risk for no good return.</p>

<h2 id="fintechs-stopgap-unicorns">Fintech’s Stopgap Unicorns</h2>

<p>The brave new world of fintech software consists of many such abstractions that really ought not to exist in an ideal world with better financial infrastructure. It’s a classic American story of governmental inaction and private opportunists seeking to fill the gap, providing acceptable service and pocketing some hefty middleman profits in the meantime. The existence of these entrenched middlemen further dampens any political interest in solving root causes of central dysfunction, and so the cycle is perpetuated.</p>

<p>Take Venmo for example. Nations around the world have begun setting up open banking APIs for peer-to-peer payments and other services by legally mandating interconnectability. The European Union’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Services_Directive">Revised Payment Services Directive</a> went into effect in 2018 putting Europe at the forefront of open banking initiatives. Supporting payments is a core function that makes a bank a bank, and in the 21st century, those payments occur over the internet and so we expect instant deposits. Instead, if we rely on existing open standards for payment in the US, ie. ACH deposits, it seems the <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/ach-transfers">fastest we can do is a few business days</a> or pay up for expensive wire transfers. And conveniently those are extra days where funds are in limbo mean that banks can earn some extra interest.</p>

<p>The US has taken a market-driven approach to hoping for more interconnectedness between banks, resulting in Zelle, a P2P payment system created by a bank consortium that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/business/zelle-banks-fraud.html">is sometimes secure</a>. Meanwhile Venmo has the first-mover advantage in the P2P payment space, and has built out a formidable network of users in a domain where implicit trust in identities is critical. Don’t like those options? You’re also free to use Messenger Pay, Apple Pay, CashApp, among a myriad set of options. Clearly, the fragmentation is killing us here, making what intuitively wants to be a well-designed protocol a mess of walled gardens with varying functionality. These days, it’s hard to even grasp how protocols like email, or heck even USPS mail, ever came to fruition against the alternative crop of self-interested ecosystems.</p>

<p>Venmo won by building an abstracted network that appears to support instant peer-to-peer payments based just on a username. Underneath, of course, it rarely arranges for any bank transfers at all, and simply adjusts numbers in a database until a user actually wants to cash out. In the meantime, parent company PayPal can enjoy <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/20/what-are-apps-venmo-doing-your-money/">the returns on idle capital</a> chilling in user wallets. This middleman profit, along with various fees for third-party integrations, seems like a fair concession for the services provided. But it gets worse: <a href="https://github.com/ccorcos/venmo-dark-patterns">Venmo is filled with dark patterns</a> that try to encourage you to share as much financial data as possible with them and others, in vague hopes of building “a social network” since apparently that’s the only end game allowed in the Valley. Perhaps outsourcing critical financial functions to growth-hungry companies with flimsy morals wasn’t such a great idea after all.</p>

<p>Plaid is another example of a Silicon Valley fintech darling filling in a gap resulting from our lack of an interbank API. Plaid allows users to connect bank accounts to other apps by logging into bank accounts on users’ behalf and scraping relevant data. Again, it’s easy to spot the …</p></section></div>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Writing tests today sucks. Tests are expensive to write. They're even more
expensive to maintain. They're somewhat opaque to anybody who's not intimately
familiar with the test harness. You can't always be sure whether you're writing
the “right” tests for your situation. Worst of all, it's sometimes difficult to
persuade a non-technical stakeholder that software testing actually does
anything underneath the hood, except maybe inflate operational expenses for your
software budget. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18442941">Every software development horror
story</a> I've heard comes with some
discussion around tests, and that's because not only does software fail in more
ways than anybody without job security may care to admit, it fails in novel and
unpredictable manners.</p>
<p>What sucks even more is <em>just how important effective software testing is</em> for
software engineers to quickly and confidently contribute value. The absolute
first thing I do after cloning most <code>git</code> repositories these days, for work or
otherwise, is run the test suite. Test suites are self-documenting and always
more accurate than a wiki or other forms of documentation, and since they're
programmatic it's much easier to tie into the rest of your developer workflow
(say when setting up automated deployments to production).</p>
<hr>
<p>Honestly, this probably isn't news to you if you've been working in industry for
a while, and it's easy to fall into a trap of powerlessness and believing any
endemic lack of alignment is eternal. And while it's not always (and usually
not) the fault of technical limitations, it may be useful to think of technical
ways to grow beyond the immediate problem. So I'd like to say there are two
great aspects about professional software that could be applied to software
testing.</p>
<p>The first is we're usually using paradigms that are decades old. Professional
software is usually incremental in action and incrementalist in thinking. This
implies there's often new concepts in academia or research that might solve
current problems. One professor I talked to around graduation 4 years ago
brought up how the A* path-finding algorithm was invented 20 years before its
adoption in the video game industry (and apparently that's at least one reason
why NPCs don't collide with in-world walls anymore).</p>
<p>The second is test suites usually under the full control of engineering. There
might be a QA department within engineering, but I have yet to see a
sales/marketing department care deeply about how you structure a test harness,
vs. the layout of a landing page. While serving the company is the goal of any
business-oriented engineering department, this means there's more agency than
usual in how engineering approaches testing, than say product implementation or
devops.</p>
<p>What we're looking for as software engineers is to write as many good tests as
possible within some limited time frame.</p>
<h2 id="different-software-testing-strategies-ive-used">Different software testing strategies I've used</h2>
<p>The most important thing about writing good tests is to start writing good
source code and develop good habits. This might involve separating concerns in a
codebase by using functions instead of classes, gradually applying type
signatures using <code>mypy</code> or <code>pyre-check</code> and adding a typechecking step to your
CI pipeline, and paying attention to software properties like immutability
(updating an object creates a copy of the object with the update instead of
mutating the original object) and idempotency (running a code block generates
the same output for the same input even for multiple runs). You can bring a lot
of value to the table by using tools + infrastructure like <code>black</code> for
autoformatting and Docker / <code>docker-compose</code> for running local infrastructure,
and a lot of this undergirds higher-order testing strategies like property-based
testing later on.</p>
<p>Some of these strategies I've applied in the field revolve around these simpler
ideas. When I'm building a webapp frontend or backend, I adopted the idea of
“functional core, imperative shell”, where you have a soup of decoupled methods
within your app that are easily unit testable, and a set of well-defined I/O
interfaces and stubs to imperative resources like your network or database to
create the cheapest possible integration tests. This is nice for stateless,
pass-through entities, but works less well when you're primarily looking for
effects (e.g. it'd be very difficult to unit test most of PostgreSQL
effectively). So when I became a data engineer, and I spent most of my day
interacting with effectful systems, I attempted with some success to write a set
of <a href="https://bytes.yingw787.com/posts/2018/11/07/data_driven_testing">data-driven integration tests using
<code>pytest</code></a> and leverage its ability to
parameterize over fixtures using data to create essentially a mongodump of test
descriptions. This solution was nice since it allowed me to scale the amount of
data I tested far beyond the amount of code I needed to write. However, I still
needed to come up with my own oracle values to test with. It's easy to run an
expensive integration test with very little added value.</p>
<p>This is where my interest in property-based testing stems from. I'd also mention
that even with property-based testing, all these testing strategies (and others
I haven't covered or discovered yet) have their place and their tradeoffs. You
should decide for yourself when to apply or to not apply each.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-property-based-testing">What is property-based testing?</h2>
<p>At its simplest, property-based testing is the inverse of normal unit testing.
Instead of providing some amount of data and a transformation so the computer
can assert a property, you provide a property and a transformation, so the
computer can provide some data.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the basics. Say you defined a method <code>addOne()</code> to increment an
integer by one:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>addOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In order to test method <code>addOne()</code>, you can define a set of unit tests:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>():
    <span>assert</span> addOne(<span>5</span>) <span>==</span> <span>6</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can even parameterize a list of oracle inputs and expected values:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> pytest

<span>@pytest.mark.parametrize</span>(<span></span><span>'</span><span>_input, _expected</span><span>'</span>, [(<span>5</span>,<span>6</span>), (<span>6</span>,<span>7</span>), (<span>7</span>,<span>8</span>)])
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input, _expected):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _expected
</code></pre></div><p>The final leap is realizing that instead of coming up with your own oracle
values, you just care that the inputs are integers and the outputs are a
functional, deterministic transform resulting in an integer output. This is
where property-based testing:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st

<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addOne</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> addOne(_input) <span>==</span> _input <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For some properties, you can define and apply the opposite transform, which when
combined with the original transform, generates the identity function, which
should then leave the input untouched:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>subOne</span>(x: int) <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> int:
    <span>return</span> x <span>-</span> <span>1</span>

<span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> given, strategies <span>as</span> st
<span>@given</span>(st<span>.</span>integers())
<span>def</span> <span>test_addsub_returns_value</span>(_input):
    <span>assert</span> subOne(addOne(_input)) <span>==</span> _input
</code></pre></div><p>So what else is it similar to / different from? One's <em>generative testing</em>,
which are tests that create tests. Since we're creating a spec here,
<code>hypothesis</code> is generating tests underneath the hood for us and running them.
Otherwise, property-based testing is a bit different as it supports intelligent
search strategies that allow us to shrink the error space.</p>
<p>Another testing paradigm similar to property-based testing is <em>fuzz testing</em>,
where random inputs are inserted into a program to see how it behaves and
whether it crashes. To me, fuzz testing is more an extension of black-box
integration testing, and extends more into devops or security related testing,
rather than the unit-focused nature of property-based testing.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hypothesis">What is <code>hypothesis</code>?</h2>
<p><code>hypothesis</code> is one of the more popular implementations of property-based
testing in Python. I had thought it originated from a PBT library called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck"><strong><code>QuickCheck</code></strong></a> in Haskell,
but after reading through a Haskell book earlier this year and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ovebeq/pythonista_s_review_haskell#c_gz09vc">talking to some
folks online</a>,
there's a more “intelligent” PBT library in Haskell it came from called
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedgehog"><strong><code>Hedgehog</code></strong></a>, which applies
built-in shrinking as part of the test generation suite.</p>
<p>You can find the <code>hypothesis</code> for Python documentation
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest">here</a>, and additional
documentation around the team behind Hypothesis
<a href="https://hypothesis.works/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-strategies"><code>hypothesis</code> strategies</h3>
<p>The key idea behind <code>hypothesis</code> is strategy generation. You can see examples of
it by running this code segment in your <code>python</code> terminal:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> hypothesis <span>import</span> strategies <span>as</span> st

st<span>.</span>text()<span>.</span>example()
</code></pre></div><p><code>hypothesis</code> supports basic strategies like those targeting Python's “primitive”
types. You can create <code>st.integers()</code> or <code>st.text()</code>. You can also do more
advanced things, like create strategies from structs like dictionaries or lists,
combine strategies together, infer strategies from a regular expression, and
build strategies from well-recognized third-party classes from <code>pandas</code> or
Django.</p>
<h3 id="hypothesis-tactics"><code>hypothesis</code> tactics</h3>
<p>I took a lot of these tactics from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcyGUVzL7HA">a talk by Zac Hatfield-Dodds introducing PBT
at PyCon US</a>. Check out his website
<a href="https://zhd.dev/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The types of properties you can apply with <code>hypothesis</code> allow for certain
tactics you can play with in <code>hypothesis</code>.</p>
<p>One of these tactics might be manually defining the property, then letting
<code>hypothesis</code> generate the test cases for you. One common way this tactic is
applied is to look for “round-trip” properties, where you look for the inverse
method and check that applying both would result in the identity method.</p>
<p>Another tactic might be to use an oracle function. This can be really helpful if
you're refactoring a piece of code and you want to carry forward the original
behavior of that method, regardless of whether it's correct or incorrect. In
this case, that method becomes an oracle and you can apply the equal-by-value
constraint between the original and refactored methods as a …</p></div></div>

      <p><strong>1. Trade Options</strong></p><p><em>Fastest</em></p><p>No doubt you have heard all about how easy it is for people to lose their life savings trading securities in the stock market. But there is actually a much faster way – options. I’m not going to get into the nuts and bolts of trading options (actually, most people who lose money with options don’t understand how they work anyway) but I will give you a quick definition and then show how efficient these instruments-of-wealth-destruction really are.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of options – calls and puts. If you buy a call option, you are purchasing the right to but the underlying stock at a specified price. So, you might pay $3,000 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares Microsoft stock at $200 per share. Then, if the stock goes up to $300 you can either buy 100 shares at $200, or you can sell the option to some other idiot and they can use it to buy the shares. But, as you might imagine, that options contract is worth a lot more than $3,000 now, and you can sell it for a premium. This is how leverage works to make money. But we’re concerned about how to use leverage to lose money.&nbsp;</p><p>The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page. But, if you’re looking to lose money don’t bother to read up on the different ways to trade options. Just go for it, and I’m certain you will lose everything. I’ll give you a few real-life examples of how I’ve lost money in options. First, buy options that are about ready to expire. In the previous example, if you bought the Microsoft options for $3,000, but the stock went to $195 instead of $300, you could lose all your money. Another easy way to lose money with options is to buy contracts that are way out of the money (OTM). This simply means you might buy Microsoft options that give you the right to buy stock at $200 – except this time, the stock is at $150 per share. If you do this, you won’t find anyone willing to buy the option contract back from you (after all, why would someone pay for the right to buy stock at $200 if it’s already at $150). And if you can’t find anyone to buy the contract from you it will expire worthless and you’ll lose all your money. Another favorite is not cutting your losses. If your contract is losing money (this often happens if you think the stock is going to go up but it goes down) and you want to lose more money, just hold it and don’t sell. Options decay with time so the longer you hold it the more likely it is that you will lose all your money. So, simply hold your position when it starts to go south and you’ll lose way more money.</p><p>Pro tip – Make sure to buy a bunch of contracts (say 10 of them) so you lose $30,000 instead of $3,000.</p><p>I could go on but I think you get the point. I have personally lost thousands of dollars using these methods and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a fast way to lose it all. I’d recommend you try losing a small amount in stocks first to get your feet wet – then dive into options. If you’re anxious to give it a go, <a href="https://cash.app/app/TDZWWPC?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">use this link to start trading with Cash App</a> and you’ll get free money to lose right away.</p><p>The only options trader who doesn’t lose money is the one who never starts.</p><p><em>- Andrew Tye</em></p><p><strong>2. Write a Book</strong></p><p><em>Most consistent</em></p><p>You might think writing a book is a great way to make a bunch of cash – and you’d be wrong. In spite of the many books that will tell you how to make money writing a book, I’m here to let you in on a secret –writing a book is actually a fantastic way to lose money. I’ve written four short books and they have literally grossed hundreds of dollars. Now – hearing that I’ve sold some books might make you think you should write one also. But it’s a trap – you will spend hundreds of hours writing a book and then make hundreds of dollars in return. Not sure about you, but if I’m working for $1/hour I’m losing money fast. My latest book probably has more pages than it has copies sold – <a href="https://gum.co/getajob?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">take a look here</a> if you want a quick reference on how to get a job.</p><p><strong>3. Teach Online Courses</strong></p><p><em>Most helpful</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Aw, I love this one. You can help other people learn a skill and lose your money at the same time. Win-lose. Some folks think they can make a great online course and it will make them a nice living or side income. Most of those nice people are wrong. News flash – more people lose money creating online courses than make money from them. The good news for you is that there really aren’t many barriers to entry here. Get yourself a cheap mic (who needs quality audio anyway) and an inexpensive webcam. And go to town without bothering to make an outline. I’ve found a couple approaches that both work well. Option A - read the script from a piece of paper. Option B – don’t plan at all and just wing the recording.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a strategy that I’ve already proven out for you. I created a few classes online and over the past 5 years they have actually generated thousands of dollars. But net returns are certainly negative because for those thousands of dollars I spent hundreds of hours creating content, answering questions, and buying likes. If you’d like a good idea of what to expect, I have over 40,000 students taking my online courses and they have generated a few thousand in gross revenues.</p><p>Pro tip – make your courses free from the start – you will recoup less of your investment this way, and end up losing quite a bit more overall.</p><p><strong>4. Get a Degree</strong></p><p><em>Most socially acceptable</em></p><p>This tactic is harder to lose money with, but when you lose you lose big. Books and courses are more consistent losers, but they don’t add up as fast as big tuition debt combined with time off work. As mentioned, you do have to be careful with this one because it is possible to get a degree and actually make money. But here is what you do to ensure loss. First, choose a degree that you aren’t passionate about, or that doesn’t have high paying jobs, or that doesn’t really have any jobs (<a href="https://lunarjobs.co/radar?utm_campaign=UA-188825179-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">research here</a>). Second, don’t get a side job during school and take all of the student loans you can get your hands on. Third, be very picky about which of the few jobs you take and only take ones that are in fact low paying (high cost of living is also preferred when choosing location). </p><p>Pro tip – fail a few classes to extend your time to graduation – that way you can take on more debt.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing to watch out for is accidentally choosing a degree that can actually make you money. Like engineering or computer science. But even this caution is less important now than when I went to college because places like Lambda School are making four year university degrees more certain losers. I’ve been on both sides of this one. I spent two years studying software development and about 4 years studying engineering. Both of those degrees were inexpensive, I worked part-time while studying, and have made money with both of them. But, thankfully I learned my lesson and managed to lose a lot of money by the time I got an MBA. I could have started a company with the money, or just worked my way up in an engineering role. But by taking on a bunch of debt and forgoing a salary for a couple years I was able to lose way more money than if I’d simply started a company. I think I actually lost more by going to business school than if I’d started a company and lost all of the investors’ money!</p><p><strong>5. Become an Inventor</strong></p><p><em>Most fun</em></p><p>Okay people, this has to be one of the most enjoyable ways to lose money! I have drummed up all sorts of new inventions. Of course, they don’t make any money but that’s sort of the point right! Most of my awesome inventions failed make money because someone else took them to market before me. Other times it was because they were so stupid nobody wanted to buy them (or even look at them actually).</p><p>I’ve invented lots of awesome products that lost money, but here is one of my favorite no-hits:</p><p><em>Barking Bulb</em>: Scare away intruders with a bark</p><p>Don’t want a dog in your backyard? Fine, get a bulb that barks when intruders are detected. Light, motion sensing and sound in one bulb. I thought this was so brilliant. Safe as having a guard dog, but you don’t have to clean up after it. Literally the best of both worlds. Coming soon to a Home Depot near you!&nbsp;</p><p>Pro tip: Go straight for all of the full, non-provisional patents you can before you know if anyone wants the idea. Don’t wait to see if it’s manufacturable. Don’t do market research to see if competitive products exist. Just talk to an attorney and get the patents drawn up. This shortcut will let you lose $20,000 to $40,000 upfront before you even start doing hardcore R&amp;D or go to production.</p><p><strong>6. Do Internet Advertising </strong></p><p><em>Most controversial&nbsp;</em></p><p>Another interesting way to lose money is with online advertising. What I like most about this one is you can lose money consistently and sound smart to your friends at the same time. Where do you spend your money they ask? Oh, I have a website with ads. Wow. That is so cool. What you do is setup a website with some content (e.g. a blog about how to lose money) and you put some ads (from Google AdSense or affiliates) on it that will generate money for you. Then, to get more people to your blog you also buy ads from Google Ads or Facebook. If you do it just right there is arbitrage here – for every dollar you spend buying ads to get traffic to your site you can get 70 cents of income from the ads on your blog. You can consistently lose $0.30 for every $1.00 you spend. The downside is nearly unlimited as long as you pick a topic that has significant search traffic.</p><p>This one is somewhat controversial because a lot of people think that putting ads on your site and then buying other ads to get more traffic is actually a good way to make money. I’ve proven that it’s much easier to lose money with this method than it is to make money. So you can ignore the doubters.</p><p><strong>7.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>This is a question that often arises in the product world and it requires our time to unpack it. Though these roles are somewhat similar and they work towards achieving the same set of goals, we then ought to look at the clear line distinction in the line of duty of the individuals and performance metric used to evaluate the success achieved by each role to help us understand them better and also help you figure out the most suitable for you.</p><p>These roles vary from company to company as in the case of a startup, a product manager is often tasked with the duty of these 3 roles while in larger or enterprise companies, there are 3 or more different roles in the product team working at different capacities to ensure that the right product is shipped and meet the demands of users.</p><p>While the product manager’s role is one that has come to limelight, the product marketing manager and product owner role have also been adopted by a lot of companies depending on their product and company culture. In this article, we will explain the difference between these roles and the job requirement of the individual involved.</p><h3 id="the-product-manager">The Product Manager</h3><p>These individuals are often referred to as mini CEOs of a product. They conduct customer surveys to figure out the customer’s pain and build solutions to address it. The PM also prioritizes what features are to be built next and prepares and manages a cohesive and digital product roadmap and strategy.</p><h3 id="the-product-marketing-manager">The Product Marketing Manager</h3><p>The PMM communicates vital product value — the “why”, “what” and “when” of a product to intending buyers. He manages the go-to-market strategy/roadmap and also oversees the pricing model of the product. The primary goal of a PMM is to create demand for the products through effective messaging and marketing programs so that the product has a shorter sales cycle and higher revenue.</p><h3 id="the-product-owner">The Product Owner</h3><p>This role exists in a scrum environment — <em><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum" title="Scrum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scrum</a> is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal.</em></p><p>A product owner (PO) maximizes the value of a product through the creation and management of the product backlog, creation of user stories for the development team. The product owner is the customer’s representative to the development team. He addresses customer’s pain points by managing and prioritizing a visible product backlog. The PO is the first point of call when the development team needs clarity about interpreting a product feature to be implemented.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Going more practical, we will use a hypothetical case study of a tech company, Slyde, to explain these roles to clearly understand their day-to-day duties.</p><p>Slyde is a financial technology company based in Lagos, Nigeria with coverage in other African countries. The company has been providing payment solutions through its web-based application but has noticed a large churn rate in areas with poor internet connection which in turn delay users from completing their transaction. The product team made this observation and has been tasked to come up with a solution.</p><h3 id="where-does-the-product-manager-product-marketing-manager-and-the-product-owner-come-in">Where does the Product Manager, Product Marketing Manager, and the Product Owner come in?</h3><p><strong>PM</strong>: The Product Manager will interface with the users through user interviews/feedback surveys or other means to hear directly from the users. They will come up with hypotheses alongside the team and validate them through prototyping and user testing. They will then create a strategy on the feature and align the team and stakeholders around it. The PM who is also the chief custodian of the entire product roadmap will, therefore, be tasked with the duty of prioritization. Before going ahead to carry out research and strategy, they will have to convince the stakeholders if it is a good choice to build the feature in context at that particular time or wait a bit longer based on the content of the roadmap.</p><p><strong>PMM</strong>: The product marketing manager is tasked with market feasibility and discovering if the features being built align with the company’s sales and revenue plan for the period. They also make research on how sought-after the feature is being anticipated and how it will impact the budget. They communicate the values of the feature; the why, what, and when to potential buyers — In this case users in countries with poor internet connection.</p><p><strong>PO</strong>: The product owner will first have to prioritize the backlog to see if there are no important tasks to be executed and if this new feature is worth leaving whatever is being built currently. They will also consider the development effort required to build the feature i.e the time, tools, and skill set that will be required. They will be the one to tell if the expertise of the current developers is enough or if more engineers or designers are needed to be able to deliver at the scheduled time. The product owner is also armed with the task of interpreting the product/feature requirements for the development team. They serve as the interface between the stakeholders and the development team.</p><hr><p>Lastly,</p><p>The goal of a product team is to delight its user by providing an excellent solution to their pain points regardless of the job title/role. Irrespective of your job role on a product team, you should always be driven by user empathy and the company’s goal as this will in-turn make you collaborate better among the team. A product person should first and foremost see themselves as a product leader — one who makes sure the user’s need is always advocated for, despite top executive declination, the product person is to persuasively align the executive to this.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Product Owner is a role you play on a Scrum team. Product Manager is the job. — Melissa Perri</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>So, regardless of your job role, a great product person will always act in the stead of a product manager and never streamline herself to the JD only but be actively involved directly or indirectly in every phase of the product development cycle. When the role is clearly understood and the duties implemented collaboratively as a team, every aspect of the product comes together in one beautiful piece.</p><p>This article first appeared on my <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/product-manager-vs-product-marketing-manager-vs-product-owner-8ab08bc45662" title="Medium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Medium</a></p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olufisayo-babalola/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Olufisayo Babalola</a> for reviewing this article.</p><hr><h3 id="sources">Sources:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/product-manager?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hero Image by airfocus on Unsplash</a></li></ul></div></article></div>]]>

Our product (dbt) was a tool that I wanted to use in order to deliver services, and I honestly never believed at the outset that there would be many other folks in the world who wanted to use it. But it turns out that there are. So it took a full 3.5 years from launching dbt and watching its growth before I felt confident that we had a real shot at being a "big" company. This is one of the main reasons we waited for so long to raise capital--we bootstrapped the entire way until we felt like we had that confidence.  </span></p><p id="viewer-cj0e4"><span>It's an unusual approach and I'm not sure it would work for every situation and every founder, but our path has had a ton of really unique benefits for us and I wouldn't trade it for anything.</span></p><p id="viewer-b0ecd"><span><span>- Tristan Handy, </span>Founder and CEO<span>, </span><a href="https://www.fishtownanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Fishtown Analytics</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-63li0"><span><span><strong>Breaking even from a Thanksgiving promotion</strong></span></span></h3><p id="viewer-394rh"><span>Honestly, I knew it was "viable" ever since I started the company - otherwise I certainly wouldn't have started it :)</span></p><p id="viewer-64kiv"><span>When I knew we'd hit the inflection point of growth though is when we ran a promotion one time, I think it was a Thanksgiving day promotion - and we sold enough in those couple days that paid for the monthly expenses at the time. That single even made us breakeven and I knew we had something that people would pay for, and that could grow quickly.</span></p><p id="viewer-fsd94"><span><span>- </span>Zeb Evans, Founderf &amp; CEO, <a href="http://clickup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>ClickUp</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-bugts"><span><strong><span>Scalable + Repeatable + Margins </span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-8p59e"><span>When we had a scalable and repeatable sales motion with acceptable margins and a large enough addressable market. I realize that’s kind of an obvious answer but I’m not sure how else to answer - this isn’t the part that’s rocket science :)</span></p><p id="viewer-7rehb"><span><span>- Geoff Schmidt, CEO and Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://www.apollographql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Apollo GraphQL</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-7ks1o"><span><strong><span>First renewal and large contract upsell</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-7iu79"><span>There wasn't an aha moment when everything clicked, rather it was a gradual realization that things were working when looking backwards. There were early indicators around 12 to 18 months into Tonic when we started signing up customers who were paying real amounts. They were putting up with our buggy early versions and eagerly asking for when certain new features would be available. Over the next 6 months we had our first renewal and a large contract upsell, that's when things realized things had been viable for a while.</span></p><p id="viewer-1fout"><span><span>- Karl Hanson, Co-Founder COO, </span><a href="https://tonic.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Tonic</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-9ek41"><span><strong><span>Open-source project with organic adoption</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-buitk"><span>It wasn't a hard question for me. It was because my startup was built around an open-source project. The project was adopted organically by multiple enterprises, and developers (who are our main users) gave us pretty positive feedback. So it was clear that idea was viable long before we started thinking about founding a company.</span></p><p id="viewer-dqpja"><span><span>- Maxim Fateev, Founder, </span><a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Temporal Technologies</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-avmqj"><span><strong><span>Positive feedback on prototype</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-bm6qc"><span>When we started Animoto in 2006 our first priority was to create a video creation product that we wanted to use ourselves. Before Animoto, it was too difficult and time-consuming to create great-looking video. Cloud-based video rendering had never been done before so we gave ourselves three months to create a prototype that would both prove out the technical concept and allow us to get user feedback. While entrepreneurs always have to be optimistic, it was only once we proved out the technical concept and got positive user experience feedback from family and friends that we knew our idea and product was viable.</span></p><p id="viewer-7tp4h"><span><span>- </span>Brad Jefferson<span>, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://animoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Animoto</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-2mf9g"><span><strong><span>First enterprise customer on annual contract</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-2prob"><span>In my startup Qwiklabs when we had a first enterprise customer sign an annual contract I knew my product/startup idea was viable. At this point we had a minimalist product addressing the critical user journey. It was unclear at that point if there was a product/market fit (that is: if we had a great product for a large market). But it was clear that our idea and MVP were unique and useful enough for a large enterprise to pay for it. We established product/market fit a year from then when over a dozen enterprise customers were paying for the full-fledged version of the product.  In my view founders have an inkling/gut feeling about an idea; founders should bring that idea to a minimalist life and very quickly start validating it. </span></p><p id="viewer-e67l1"><span><span>- Jitesh Shetty, Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://infinichains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Infinichains</span></u></a> </span></p><h3 id="viewer-2l3n1"><span><strong><span>The first dollar</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-18vsj"><span>I have a very simple answer... it was when the first dollar came through the door. At that moment I remember thinking that if one customer was willing to trust us and pay us, there are likely many more out there and we have a viable idea. To me it was completely eye-opening and even unexpected that someone was willing to pay for a product we had just built and was still incredibly raw. I knew that if we kept building, kept learning and improving we would reach many more people. Honestly that first payment we received was a really emotional moment and the energy it created to forge ahead was enormous.  </span></p><p id="viewer-2ohu"><span><span>- Michael Balyasny,  CEO, </span><a href="https://attendify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Attendify</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-f3oe0"><span><strong><span>You never know until it is (but there are milestones)</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-bpr5f"><span>the honest answer is you never know until it is, and even then you question it, or at least i do.  however, i think some milestones might include:  </span></p><p id="viewer-22roj"><span>1.	when we got our first ever contract </span></p><p id="viewer-27cvq"><span>1.5 	when we raised our first seed round </span></p><p id="viewer-5vr4i"><span>2.	when companies that previously had said "oh, what a cute idea (im paraphrasing)" </span></p><p id="viewer-63d5t"><span>	actually starting using the technology </span></p><p id="viewer-873k9"><span>3.	when we got our first enterprise contract  </span></p><p id="viewer-7a6ag"><span>i realize these all have to do with money, which is not really why i became an entrepreneur - however, viability as a for-profit enterprise involves selling your product so... that's my answer.</span></p><p id="viewer-396ac"><span><span>- Frida Polli, CEO and Co-Founder, </span><a href="https://www.pymetrics.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>pymetrics</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-4bdfv"><span><strong><span>Customer requests and usage despite drawbacks</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-7c6nq"><span>I don’t think there’s any particular framework.

From there, you have to listen to your early customers and challenge all of the hypotheses you have while staying true to the vision or disruption you know the market needs. For us, that's building a virtual CM that doesn't own a single machine or factory.

We changed what we were doing a total of 5 times in the first year - working on products ranging from a 1:1 tool for sales leaders, to a tool to monitor technical debt. The biggest thing that we knew we'd finally got it right was how it felt to grow. We published our open source product analytics platform on a big developer forum and it has grown organically ever since, at an increasing rate as we've focussed on the product. Every other idea we had, I was pushing very hard just to get one user at a time to try it out, whereas after just the first month of building PostHog, it just suddenly felt like running downhill. If you're not finding it easy to grow, then you probably aren't quite there yet. The end result was after we got the idea right, we were able to build a community of thousands of developers and to raise $12M within less than a year.</span></p><p id="viewer-63kho"><span><span>- James Hawkins, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, </span><a href="https://posthog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>PostHog</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><h3 id="viewer-bs5qc"><span><strong><span>Gradually</span></strong></span></h3><p id="viewer-ccpq1"><span>As with the business of growing old, there is not one moment but a gradual, inevitable realization.

I spend way too much time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.  It's a fun place, and a good way to keep up to date on all the new tech that us developer folk seem to need to know about.  But it also leaves a fella feeling like he <b>really needs to keep up</b> with all this stuff.  I mean, if you don't have a side project using the latest client-side framework, well, good luck ever finding a job again in this industry.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it, I find that I straddle the line on this. As a long-time contractor, I try to stay up to date on the New Shiny and will happily run with whatever flavor of the month language, framework, and programming paradigm that a given gig wants. Yeah, sure, Node.js with tons of functional stuff mixed in pulling from a NoSQL store and React on the front end. I'm your guy. We're gonna change the world!
</p>
<p>
But for 
<a href="https://www.twiddla.com/">my</a>
<a href="https://unwaffle.com/">own</a>
<a href="https://www.s3stat.com/">stuff</a>, 
there's no way I'd use any of that crap. Good old C#, SQL Server and a proper boring stack and tool set that I know won't just up and fall over on a Saturday morning and leave me debugging NPM dependencies all weekend instead of bouldering in the forest with the kids. This stuff is my proper income stream, and the most important thing is that it works. If that means I have to write a "for" loop and declare variables and risk 19 year old kids snooting down at my code, so be it.
</p>
<h4>I can't tell you how nice it is to have software in production on a boring stack. It gives you freedom to do other things.</h4>

<p>
I can (and often do) go entire months without touching the codebase of my main rent-paying products. It means I can, among other things, pick up a full-time development gig to sock away some extra runway, take off and go backpacking around the world, or better still, build yet another rent-paying product without having to spend a significant amount of time keeping the old stuff alive.
</p>
<p>
It seems like on a lot of stacks, keeping the server alive, patched and serving webpages is a part-time job in itself. In my world, that's Windows Update's job. Big New Releases come and go, but they're all 100% backwards compatible, so when you get around to upgrading it's just a few minutes of point and clicking with nothing broken.
</p>
<p>
I see it as analogous to <b>Compound Interest, but to productivity</b>. The less effort you need to spend on maintenance, the more pace you can keep going forward.
</p>
<p>
But yeah, the key is to never get so far down in to that comfy hole that you can't hop back into the present day when it's time to talk shop with the cool kids.  Shine on, flavor of the week!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Alongside cooking for myself and walking laps around the house, Japanese cartoons (or “anime” as the kids are calling it) are something I’ve learned to love during quarantine.</p>

<p>The problem with watching anime, though, is that short of learning Japanese, you become dependent on human translators and voice actors to port the content to your language. Sometimes you get the subtitles (“subs”) but not the voicing (“dubs”). Other times, entire seasons of shows aren’t translated at all, and you’re left on the edge of your seat with only Wikipedia summaries and 90s web forums to ferry you through the darkness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what are you supposed to do? The answer is obviously not to ask a computer to transcribe, translate, and voice-act entire episodes of a TV show from Japanese to English. Translation is a careful art that can’t be automated, and requires the loving touch of a human hand. Besides, even if you did use machine learning to translate a video, you couldn’t use a computer to dub… I mean, who would want to listen to machine voices for an entire season? It’d be awful. Only a real sicko would want that.</p>

<p>So in this post, I’ll show you how to use machine learning to transcribe, translate, and voice-act videos from one language to another, i.e. “AI-Powered Video Dubs.” It might not get you Netflix-quality results, but you can use it to localize online talks and YouTube videos in a pinch. We’ll start by transcribing audio to text using Google Cloud’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">Speech-to-Text API</a>. Next, we’ll translate that text with the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/translate">Translate API</a>. Finally, we’ll “voice act” the translations using the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a>, which produces voices that are, according to the docs, “humanlike.”</p>

<p>(By the way, before you flame-blast me in the comments, I should tell you that YouTube will <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-videos-on-demand">automatically and for free</a> transcribe and translate your videos for you. So you can treat this project like your new hobby of baking sourdough from scratch: a really inefficient use of 30 hours.)</p>

<h2 id="ai-dubbed-videos-do-they-axe-usually-sound-grood">AI-Dubbed Videos: Do they axe usually sound grood?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Before you embark on this journey, you probably want to know what you have to look forward to. What quality can we realistically expect to achieve from an ML-video-dubbing pipeline?</p>

<p>Here’s one example dubbed automatically from English to Spanish (the subtitles are also automatically generated in English). I haven’t done any tuning or adjusting on it:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cURHKESgNaI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>As you can see, the transcriptions are decent but not perfect, and the same for the translations. (Ignore the fact that the speaker sometimes speaks too fast–more on that later.) Overall, you can easily get the gist of what’s going on from this dubbed video, but it’s not exactly near human-quality.</p>

<p>What makes this project trickier (read: more fun) than most is that there are at least three possible points of failure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The video can be incorrectly transcribed from audio to text by the Speech-to-Text API</li>
  <li>That text can be incorrectly or awkwardly translated by the Translation API</li>
  <li>Those translations can be mispronounced by the Text-to-Speech API</li>
</ol>

<p>In my experience, the most successful dubbed videos were those that featured a single speaker over a clear audio stream and that were dubbed from English to another language. This is largely because the quality of transcription (Speech-to-Text) was much higher in English than other source languages.</p>

<p>Dubbing from non-English languages proved substantially more challenging. Here’s one particularly unimpressive dub from Japanese to English of one of my favorite shows, Death Note:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWNRfeEHmp4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>If you want to leave translation/dubbing to humans, well–I can’t blame you. But if not, read on!</p>

<h2 id="building-an-ai-translating-dubber">Building an AI Translating Dubber</h2>

<p>As always, you can find all of the code for this project in the <a href="https://github.com/google/making_with_ml/tree/master/ai_dubs">Making with Machine Learning Github repo</a>. To run the code yourself, follow the README to configure your credentials and enable APIs. Here in this post, I’ll just walk through my findings at a high level.</p>

<p>First, here are the steps we’ll follow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract audio from video files</li>
  <li>Convert audio to text using the Speech-to-Text API</li>
  <li><strong>Split transcribed text into sentences/segments for translation</strong></li>
  <li>Translate text</li>
  <li>Generate spoken audio versions of the translated text</li>
  <li><strong>Speed up the generated audio to align with the original speaker in the video</strong></li>
  <li>Stitch the new audio on top of the fold audio/video</li>
</ol>

<p>I admit that when I first set out to build this dubber, I was full of hubris–all I had to do was plug a few APIs together, what could be easier? But as a programmer, all hubris must be punished, and boy, was I punished.</p>

<p>The challenging bits are the ones I bolded above, that mainly come from having to align translations with video. But more on that in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-google-cloud-speech-to-text-api">Using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API</h2>

<p>The first step in translating a video is transcribing its audio to words. To do this, I used Google Cloud’s <a href="https://daleonai.com/translate-dub-videos-with-ml?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Speech-to-Text API</a>. This tool can recognize audio spoken in 125 languages, but as I mentioned above, the quality is highest in English. For our use case, we’ll want to enable a couple of special features, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/enhanced-models?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Enhanced models</a>. These are Speech-to-Text models that have been trained on specific data types (“video,” “phone_call”) and are usually higher-quality. We’ll use the “video” model, of course.</li>
  <li>Profanity filters. This flag prevents the API from returning any naughty words.</li>
  <li>Word time offsets. This flag tells the API that we want transcribed words returned along with the times that the speaker said them. We’ll use these timestamps to help align our subtitles and dubs with the source video.</li>
  <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/context-strength?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Speech Adaption</a>. Typically, Speech-to-Text struggles most with uncommon words or phrases. If you know certain words or phrases are likely to appear in your video (i.e. “gradient descent,” “support vector machine”), you can pass them to the API in an array that will make the more likely to be transcribed:</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>speech</span><span>.</span><span>SpeechClient</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The API returns the transcribed text along with word-level timestamps as JSON. As an example, I transcribed <a href="https://youtu.be/o6nGn1euRjk">this video</a>. You can see the JSON returned by the API in <a href="https://gist.github.com/dalequark/e983b929b6194adb49d00a9c55ae4e33">this gist</a>. The output also lets us do a quick quality sanity check:</p>

<p><em>What I actually said:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Software Developers. We’re not known for our rockin’ style, are we? Or <em>are</em> we? Today, I’ll show you how I used ML to make me trendier, taking inspiration from influencers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>What the API thought I said:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Software developers. We’re not known for our Rock and style. Are we or are we today? I’ll show you how I use ml to make new trendier taking inspiration from influencers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my experience, this is about the quality you can expect when transcribing high-quality English audio. Note that the punctuation is a little off. If you’re happy with viewers getting the gist of a video, this is probably good enough, although it’s easy to manually  correct the transcripts yourself if you speak the source language.</p>

<p>At this point, we can use the API output to generate (non-translated) subtitles. In fact, if you run my script with the `–srt` flag, it will do exactly that for you (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/srt-file#:~:text=An%20SRT%20file%20(otherwise%20known,the%20sequential%20number%20of%20subtitles.">srt</a> is a file type for closed captions):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python dubber.py my_movie_file.mp4 <span>"en"</span> outputDirectory <span>--srt</span> <span>--targetLangs</span> <span>[</span><span>"es"</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="machine-translation">Machine Translation</h2>

<p>Now that we have the video transcripts, we can use the <a href="https://daleonai.com/cloud.google.com/translate?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=CDR_dal_aiml_ai-dubs_020221">Translate API</a> to… uh… translate them.</p>

<p>This is where things start to get a little 🤪.</p>

<p>Our objective is this: we want to be able translate words in the original video and then play them back at roughly the same point in time, so that my “dubbed” voice is speaking in alignment with my actual voice.</p>

<p>The problem, though, is that translations aren’t word-for-word. A sentence translated from English to Japanese may have word order jumbled. It may contain fewer words, more words, different words, or (as is the case with idioms) completely different wording.</p>

<p>One way we can get around this is by translating entire <em>sentences</em> and then trying to align the time boundaries of those sentences. But even this becomes complicated, because how do you denote a single sentence? In English, we can split words by punctuation mark, i.e.:</p>

<p><code>"Hi! My name is Dale. What's up?" --&gt; ["Hi", "My name is Dale", "What's up"]</code></p>

<p>But punctuation differs by language (there’s no ¿ in English), and some languages don’t separate sentences by punctuation marks at all.</p>

<p>Plus, in real life speech, we often don’t talk in complete sentences. Y’know?</p>

<p>Another wrinkle that makes translating transcripts difficult is that, in general, the <em>more</em> context you feed into a translation model, the higher quality translation you can expect. So for example, if I translate the following sentence into French:</p>

<p>“I’m feeling blue, but I like pink too.”</p>

<p>I’ll get the translation:</p>

<p>“Je me sens bleu, mais j’aime aussi le rose.”</p>

<p>This is accurate. But if I split that sentence in two (“I’m feeling blue” and “But I like pink too”) and translate each part separately, I get:</p>

<p>“Je me sens triste, mais j’aime aussi le rose”, i.e. “I’m feeling sad, but I like pink too.”</p>

<p>This is all to say that the more we chop up text before sending it to the Translate API, the worse quality the translations will be (though it’ll be more easy to temporally align them with the video).</p>

<p>Ultimately, the strategy I chose was to split up spoken words every time the speaker took a greater-than-one-second pause in speaking. Here’s an example of what that looked like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>   </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"en"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Software developers."</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"start_time"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.2</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"end…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>There's a Yom Kippur joke I love: the rabbi and the richest man in town are praying, "Oh Lord, I am nothing, I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The synagogue's janitor sees them and joins in: "I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The richest man says to the rabbi: "Look who thinks he's nothing."</p>
<p>The humblebrag is a wild phenomena, and it's endemic to a certain kind of tech criticism. When a technologist – what Maria Farrell calls a "prodigal tech bro" – confesses that he's an evil genius, then "genius" is the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/">https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/</a></p>
<p>Think of the "AI" scientists who claim that they are about to be responsible for massive waves of technological unemployment, seeming to confess to a sin while actually overpromising on their AI.</p>

<p>Or the critique of "surveillance capitalism" that takes at face value ad-tech's outlandish boasts about how good they are at changing peoples' minds with data-mining, and then warns that we're all about to be enslaved to mind-control tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Or the hand-wringing over the "trolley problem" of self-driving cars, as though the issue with these cars will be their reliable fine-grained judgments, rather than their unreliability and anticompetitive fealty to their manufacturers.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>This is what Lee Vinsel calls "criti-hype," criticism that actually builds on – and depends on – maintaining the halo of devastating potency that surrounds overhyped technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5</a></p>
<p>While it's true that the social problems that technologies create have unique, subtle elements that require a fine-grained understanding of the underlying science, it's a mistake to assume this obviates historical lessons.</p>
<p>Like, blockchain and proof-of-work and cryptography do bring unique facets to the problems of financial engineering, money-laundering and fraud – but all the problems of financial engineering and money-laundering and fraud are still in the mix.</p>
<p>Ad-tech and engagement-maximization systems add new wrinkles to the problems of communications monopolies and the epistemological chaos created by corrupt institutions, but the chaos and the monopolies are still central to these problems.</p>
<p>The problem with many metacritics of tech – people who criticize tech critics – is their assumption that tech is irrelevant. The problem with tech critics themselves is their assumption that tech is dispositive.</p>
<p>The reality is that tech has formal characteristics – the universality of Turing completeness – that both expand the policy toolkit (the power of interoperability mandates) and constrain it (the futility of cryptography back-doors).</p>
<p>Criti-hype is real, and its remedy isn't to ignore technicalities and criticize tech as though it was just another industry – the remedy is to really understand what tech can and can't do, and to understand that the industry isn't run by super-genuises (evil or otherwise) nor science heroes (or villains).</p>

<p>Instead, 2018 turned out to be the year we lost R2R: 20 bills defeated in 20 state houses, and it was mostly Apple's fault.</p>
<p>Apple has a problem. As CEO Tim Cook warned his investors at the conclusion of his company's repair-killing lobbying spree, Apple's profits depend on people throwing away their devices, not fixing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/</a></p>
<p>By monopolizing repairs, Apple doesn't just get to gouge you on parts and service – the real action is in pronouncing your device DOA, beyond repair. Then you have to buy another one.</p>
<p>Other companies lobbied hard against R2R: John Deere, GM, and other monopolists backed Apple's play. But Apple wrote the playbook, coming up with risible bullshit like claims that blocking independent repair is essential to protecting privacy.</p>

<p>Apple's anti-repair FUD got picked up and amplified by Big Car in 2020, when they spent millions fighting an automotive R2R ballot initiative in Massachusetts, claiming that letting independent mechanics at your car would lead to your actual <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r</a></p>
<p>2018 is the year we lost Right to Repair, but 2021 might be the year we win it. We're only a month in and 14 states are already debating R2R legislation, with more to come. The Repair Coalition and PIRG are leading the fight, buoyed by massive R2R successes in the EU.</p>
<p>Independent repair isn't just fair and it isn't just good for the planet – it's also good for the nation and its economy. The average US family loses $330/year thanks to anti-repair practices, a $40b drag on the American economy.</p>
<p>Repair creates local jobs for SMEs whose earnings – from helping their neighbors – are taxed (not hidden in offshore tax-havens) and contribute to their communities. These are on-shore, dignified tech jobs – not slave labor in Xinjiang or coerced labor in a Foxconn plant.</p>
<p>Repair diverts ewaste from landfills. Each kiloton of ewaste creates &lt;1 landfill jobs, or 15 recyling jobs.</p>
<p>But that same kiloton of ewaste creates 200 local repair jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution">https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Jobs-Revolution</a></p>
<p>Repair creates a secondary market for low-cost devices that find their way into the hands of people on the wrong side of the digital divide – a divide that got starker and more consequential during the pandemic, and will only get more important in years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the pandemic: anti-repair laws meant that when PB840 ventilators (the most common ventilator, sold by the monopolist Medtronic, which benefits from the largest-ever tax-avoidance "reverse takeover" in corporate history) broke, they couldn't be legally fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, desperate med-tech people turned to a lone Polish hacker who built Medtronic defeat devices into old guitar-pedals and clock radios to get around the anti-repair measures in the ventilators that hospitals had bought and paid for.</p>

<p>R2R is a fight for justice. For the right to decide who fixes your stuff. For the right to set up shop and help your neighbors. For self-reliance and resiliency over profits. For on-shore small businesses over multinational cheaters.</p>
<p>Once again, a wave of R2R laws is sweeping the nation. The monopolists who profiteered off our misery during the pandemic will once again turn out to stop them. PIRG and the Repair Coalition need our support – as do their coalition allies like EFF.</p>

<p>When you hear the phrase "free market," you probably think of "a market that is free from regulation" but that's the opposite of the phrase's original meaning!</p>
<p>Adam Smith used the term to describe a market that was free from "economic rents" – money earned by owning things, rather than doing things. Smith recognized that markets attract parasites – "rentiers" – who seek to drain wealth by "investing" rather than building and doing.</p>
<p>Which meant that, in the absence of muscular state  intervention, markets would become less and less free – more and more dependent on the whims of rentiers who used money to breed money by creating toll-barriers between parts of the productive economy.</p>
<p>For Smith, markets were only free if they were regulated. But that's the opposite of the way that we talk about free markets today. Today, a free market is a market where you are free to collect rents – passive income from owning things, at the expense of people doing things.</p>
<p>This is true in so many metaphorical ways, but it's especially true when we're talking about actual rent – actual homes that people need to survive and produce, whose primary role today is to serve as an asset class to be maximized, not a basic human right.</p>
<p>London is ground zero for the conversion of housing from a human right to a speculative asset, a city at war with itself, filled up with empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, while productive workers – the "essential workers" of the pandemic – triple-up in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The conversion of London from a city to an asset was hugely profitable, primarily for offshore "investors," especially criminals who were attracted by London's veneer of respectability, which allowed them to convert their loot to legitimate earnings through property sales.</p>
<p>The overslosh of these tremendous cash flows has hopelessly corrupted London's planning authorities, who are absolutely helpless and hopeless at holding developers to their own promises – new builds get extra storeys and shed public concessions without penalty.</p>
<p>And just as the tax-authorities who despair of enforcing against the real cheats turn their efforts to everyday people who can't afford to fight investigations, London's planners spend their days making life miserable for homeowners trying to make minor improvements.</p>
<p>I spent two years fighting Hackney for the right to build a small, windowed greenhouse on my flat's balcony, finally giving up on growing my own veggies. Meanwhile, the for-profit "student residence" across the street replaced hundreds of small offices, overbuilt and busted.</p>
<p>Today, it's a failed Wework, while the four-storey "boutique hotel" across the street has been transformed into eight+ storeys, with multiple storeys of office space, all without any planning enforcement.</p>
<p>The conversion of London into a …</p></div></article></div>

So there was widespread satisfaction last week when  members of an online discussion group called WallStreetBets started  beating the Wall Street bully boys at their own game. Ringleaders of the  group noticed that hedge funds had taken a short position in the  videogame retailer GameStop that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">far exceeded</a> the number of shares available to trade. Motivated as much by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/">revenge</a>  as by profit, these influencers in the group encouraged the 2.7 million  members (since risen to around 8 million) to purchase the stock in  order to drive the price higher and create a massive short squeeze. This  quickly became a movement with a cause similar to that of Occupy Wall  Street, except much more effective because it hit the intended target  where they would feel it the most, in the wallet. “The only way to beat a  rigged game,” one WallStreetBets leader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">said</a>, “is to rig it even harder.”&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop  stock, which closed at $17.69 a share on Jan. 8, shot up to $347.51 by  the close last Wednesday. With combined losses of almost $20 billion,  hedge funds were on the ropes and close to bleeding out, selling their  longs in an increasingly futile effort to cover their shorts. One fund,  Melvin Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/melvin-capital-lost-more-than-50percent-after-betting-against-gamestop-wsj.html">lost over half its value</a> and had to be bailed out by <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305">hedge fund sugar daddies</a>  Ken Griffin (Citadel) and Steve Cohen (Point 72). An even bigger fund,  Citron, was teetering on the brink of collapse. All this outsider army  needed to win was the continued ability to communicate with each other  online, and their collective ability to keep piling into the “Buy” side  of the trade. Within hours, they would be hobbled on the first front and  crippled on the second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></p><p>First, the digital distribution platform Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server">banned</a> the WallStreetBets account after the close Wednesday for “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-bans-wallstreetbets-server-hate-speech-reddit-gamestop-gme-2021-1">hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation</a>.” (For a moment, it looked like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l6i26r/discord_and_reddit_remove_rwallstreetbets/">Reddit had also banned </a>the  group, but they resisted pressure to do so.) If the quoted  justification sounds familiar, it’s nearly identical to the one given by  Google, Apple, and Amazon for deplatforming Parler just three weeks  earlier. Echoing Amazon, Discord said it had sent the group repeated  warnings about objectionable content before deciding, on that day of all  days, to shut them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, WallStreetBets investors  were locked out of their trading accounts by online brokers such as  Robinhood on Thursday morning. Based on new collateral requirements that  it says were imposed by an industry consortium, Robinhood forbade its  users from buying GameStop and other stocks that WallStreetBets had  identified as short squeeze opportunities. Users were allowed only to  “close their positions”—in other words, to sell to the shorts desperate  to buy. When angry users registered their disapproval by leaving over  100,000 one-star reviews of the Robinhood app in the Google Play Store,  Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">deleted</a> them.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal  trading was allowed to resume Friday, but the hedge funds used their  24-hour sole ownership of the battlefield to fortify their positions,  covering the most vulnerable shorts. Wall Street then sent in  reinforcements, as new short positions were taken at these high price  levels, virtually guaranteed to pay out when, inevitably, the air leaks  out of the balloon. Faced with a game that, for once, they couldn’t rig  in their favor, it appeared that the insiders tipped the board over and  started a new game. As a massively decentralized online group of scrappy  outsiders, the only tools at WallStreetBets’ disposal were online  trading and social networking. Both were frozen at the crucial moment,  and the hedge fund insiders were let off the hook. The weaponization of  censorship is a big part of the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Down the Slippery Slope</strong></p><p>Some of us <a href="https://davidsacks.medium.com/the-speech-cartel-b3f5555f7787">warned</a>  of a slippery slope when Parler was taken down and a sitting president  was systematically ghosted from every online speech platform. But we  could not have foreseen how slippery the slope would be, or how fast we  would slide down it. We were told that the curbs on speech of President  Trump and his supporters were necessary to prevent further  “insurrection” and protect the peaceful transition of power. However,  much like the troops and barricades that still ring the Capitol, these  speech restrictions remain in place well after the transition of power  has occurred. The censorship power is always justified in response to a  genuine outrage or crisis, but it is rarely relinquished once the threat  passes. Rather it gets weaponized to protect powerful, connected  insiders, as the GameStop fiasco illustrates.</p><p>How do we suppose  Discord chose that moment to enforce its “Community Guidelines” against  WallStreetBets? Almost certainly, one of the hedge funds whose ox was  being gored combed through their message boards looking for anything  that might violate the terms of service. And surely they found it, as  these boards contain the same raunchy language you would hear if you  visited any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street. They presumably  reported the content to Discord, which took the group down.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Discord warn WallStreetBets of content violations before last Wednesday? I’m sure they did. Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/">sent</a>  such a warning letter to Parler as well. Frankly, such a letter could  be, and likely is, sent to every large message board on the web. The  founder of a user-generated content site described it to me as “the One  Percent Problem.” Every user-generated content site will have a small  percentage of offensive material that gets through, no matter how many  content moderators are hired. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and  YouTube <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook">allowed far more content</a> advocating for and planning the Capitol riot than Parler. But instead of acknowledging this, they were eager to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">blame</a>  the upstart, which had recently taken over the top spot in the social  networking category in the app store. Scapegoating Parler served the  dual purpose of deflecting blame and squashing a competitor.</p><p>Critics  of social networks insist that these sites simply need to double down  on censorship in order to finally rid us of problematic speech. But that  ignores how social media moderation actually works. Algorithms set to  recognize keywords capture only a small fraction of problematic posts,  leaving millions of posts for humans to review. The work is so  voluminous that it’s outsourced to far-flung locales where English may  not even be the first language. Low-level employees must decipher  complicated guidelines while navigating our increasingly Byzantine world  of political and cultural hot-buttons. Mistakes are inevitable, and the  harder a company tightens the standards to get the One Percent Problem  down to 0.1 or 0.01 percent, the more undeserving accounts—from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-blocked-accessing-facebook-page-over-violating-community-standards-1560639">Ron Paul</a> to the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/01/23/pers-j23.html">Socialist Equality Party</a>—will  be swept up in the dragnet. With the Town Square now digitized,  centralized, and privatized in the hands of a cartel of Big Tech  companies, the protections of the First Amendment no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insiders Vs. Outsiders</strong></p><p>Censorship  is about who has the power to censor, and what checks are placed upon  that power. Right now, tech companies have all the power, and they  exercise it as a like-minded cartel. When we see Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz voice similar concerns over what happened to  WallStreetBets last week, we should realize that the politics of this  issue in the post-Trump era will no longer divide along an axis of Left  and Right, but of insider and outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, when  she started landing blows against Wall Street after the 2008 financial  crisis, met with President Obama’s economics adviser, the former  treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. He presented her  with a choice: “I could be an insider or I could be an outsider,” she  recalled in her 2014 memoir, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. “Outsiders can  say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them.  Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas.  People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders  also understand one unbreakable rule: <em>They don’t criticize other insiders</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s  precisely this insider-protection scheme that the internet and social  media have most disrupted. Insiders are massively powerful but few in  number. Outsiders have always been numerous but unorganized. Social  networking and online organizing have given the outsiders real power to  effect change, and finally register their disgust at the way incompetent  elites protect each other. The elites of Big Business, Big Media, Wall  Street, and Washington are terrified of this, and will leverage any  censorship power to keep the outsiders at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real “Big Lie”</strong></p><p>After  the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6, we heard a lot about  the “Big Lie” perpetrated by Trump and his allies that the election was  “stolen.” In reality, this narrative never got far. It was rejected by  the media (including Fox News), thrown out by the courts, labeled by  social networks as “disputed,” and dismissed by politicians, including  Trump’s own vice president. Yes, some far-right groups like the Proud  Boys and Oath Keepers came to Washington to commit acts of violence, but  they were roundly denounced. For a Big Lie to be successful, it has to  have buy-in from the people in power, moneyed interests, the  narrative-framers in the media generally, all of whom have to benefit  from the lie and therefore repeat it.&nbsp;</p><p>But what issue could  possibly unite all of these constituencies? For several years, elites in  the media, government, and now finance have denounced social media as a  tool for propaganda, disinformation and hate. Social media was to blame  for the Russian disinformation that supposedly elected Trump in 2016.  Social …</p></div></div>

<b>Moscow, February 2, 2021</b> – The Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund) announce that the Lancet, one of the world's oldest and most respected medical journals, has published interim results of a Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik V, confirming the vaccine’s high efficacy and safety. Sputnik V, which is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vectors platform, is the world’s first registered vaccine against coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
In the interim efficacy analysis of the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, where data on 19,866 volunteers were included in the efficacy analysis (14,964 of whom received the vaccine and 4,902 the placebo), the two-dose treatment of Sputnik V administered 21 days apart demonstrated efficacy of 91.6% against COVID-19. The calculation is based on the analysis of 78 confirmed cases of COVID-19 identified in the placebo group (62 cases) and in the vaccine group (16 cases). Sputnik V generated a robust humoral and cell mediated immune response.
</p>
<p>
<b>Alexander Gintsburg, Director of the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The publication of internationally peer reviewed data on Sputnik V’s clinical trial results is a great success in the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Russian vaccine’s safety and high efficacy are shown by the hard scientific data presented and I congratulate the entire team of Gamaleya National Research Center for this monumental achievement. Several vaccines have already been created based on human adenoviruses and this tool is one of the most promising for development of new vaccines in the future.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund,</b> commented:
</p>
<p>
“This is a great day in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The data published by The Lancet proves that not only Sputnik V is the world’s first registered vaccine, but also one of the best. It fully protects against severe COVID-19 according to data which has been independently compiled and reviewed by peers and then published in The Lancet. Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90% but outperforms them in terms of safety, ease of transportation due to storage requirements of +2 to +8 degrees and a more affordable price. Sputnik V is a vaccine for all mankind.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Hildegund C.J. Ertl, M.D., Professor, Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center, The Wistar Institute, USA,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing serious disease or death, which in the end is the most crucial parameter; we can all deal with the sniffles as long as we stay out of the hospital or the graveyard. Even after a single dose of this prime-boost regimen protection against disease was at 87.6%. Sputnik V is thus more effective than the AstraZeneca or Johnson&amp;Johnson. Sputnik V, which, unlike the equally efficacious RNA vaccines of Pfizer and Moderna, can be stored in the fridge, will be of tremendous value to combat the global COVID-19 pandemic.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Cecil Czerkinsky, PhD, M.D., Research Director, National Institute of Health and Medical research (Inserm), France,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The interim results of the phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V COVID adenovirus vector vaccine are fairly impressive. This vaccine appears to be highly efficacious and immunogenic across age groups. This is clearly good news as this dual formulation vaccine is comparatively easy to manufacture and to deploy amid the anticipated global shortage of vaccines and logistical problems in vaccination roll-out of temperature-sensitive vaccines recently authorized for emergency use.”
</p>
<p>
<b>Omar Sued, President of the Society of infectologists, Argentina,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“The paper, published in The Lancet, confirms successful results and provides additional information about the efficacy and the safety of this vaccine in different subgroups. From the public health´s point of view, the efficacy of the vaccine was very high. The safety profile was very good. The dissemination of this information is vital for informing the scaling up and rollout of this vaccine worldwide.”
</p>
<p>
<b>David Livermore, Professor of Medical Microbiology at the University of East Anglia, UK,</b> said:
</p>
<p>
“Presently the world needs all the good vaccines that it can get against COVID-19. And these are impressive results: Sputnik V is the first adenovirus vector vaccine to achieve the 90% efficacy seen with the two mRNA vaccines.”
</p>
<p>
According to the peer-reviewed study results, the vaccine provides full protection against severe cases of the novel coronavirus infection. Among the confirmed severe cases of COVID-19, 20 were recorded in the placebo group, while none were recorded in the vaccine group. Due to the time needed for the immune response to develop, in the first week after vaccination there was no significant difference in protection against severe cases of COVID-19 between the vaccine and placebo groups, while in the period from 7 to 14 days the vaccine’s efficacy rose to 50%, in the period from 14 to 21 days to 74.1%, and to 100% from the 21st day, giving full protection against severe cases of the coronavirus.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the study included 2,144 volunteers over 60 years old with the maximum ages of 87 years (vaccine group) and 84 years (placebo group), showing great safety results for the elder age strata. The vaccine’s efficacy for the elderly was shown at 91.8% and did not differ statistically from the group of 18-60 years old, also demonstrating great safety and immunogenicity results.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V has demonstrated an excellent safety profile: 70 episodes of serious adverse events (SAE) not related to COVID-19 were recorded in 68 study participants: in 45 volunteers from the vaccine group and 23 volunteers from the placebo group. None of these events were associated with the vaccination as confirmed by Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Most adverse events (94%) were mild and were limited to flu-like syndromes, injection site reactions, headache and asthenia.
</p>
<p>
Sputnik V is one of only three vaccines in the world to have demonstrated efficacy of over 90%. Sputnik V stands out among these vaccines thanks to a number of key advantages, namely: a well-studied and highly efficient human adenoviral vector mechanism proven safe over decades; the vaccine’s low cost in comparison to other approaches; and fewer logistics requirements with a storage temperature of between two to eight degrees Celsius allowing for easier distribution worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called "spikes" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body to generate a stable immune response.
</p>
<p>
In addition, Sputnik V uses two different vectors - based on human adenovirus serotypes Ad5 and Ad26 - in two separate shots, allowing for a more effective defense against the coronavirus than vaccines using the same vector for both shots. By deploying two different vectors, Sputnik V avoids a possible neutralizing effect and generates a durable and longer-lasting immune response.

<p><em>In each issue of the “Cloud Irregular” newsletter, I’ll try to provide a useful piece of commentary on some tech-related topic. After that I’ll let you know about any new stuff I’ve published, or upcoming talks. Then I’ll give you something extremely silly, just to cleanse your palate, and we’ll be done.</em></p>

<p><em>Sound good? If so, throw in your email at the bottom of this post.</em></p>

<h3 id="amazon-won-t-spin-off-aws-and-that-s-too-bad-for-aws">Amazon won’t spin off AWS, and that’s too bad for AWS</h3>

<p>First let’s make one thing perfectly clear: Amazon and AWS are not splitting up. AWS CEO Andy Jassy has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/11/aws-ceo-we-would-follow-the-law-if-regulators-demand-amazon-spin-out.html">repeatedly avowed</a> that the only way AWS will ever leave the mothership is if federal regulators feed him feet first into a wood chipper.</p>

<p>On one level, this makes sense. AWS still generates something like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/25/aws-earnings-q1-2019.html">half of Amazon’s operating income</a>. Amazon can wrap its tentacles around every facet of the consumer experience because of the big dollars rolling in from its cloud business. AWS’s dominance fuels big AMZN share prices and funds new innovation, etc, etc. We get it: Amazon will let go of AWS when you pry it from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/07/28/biceps-billionaire-doesnt-matter-jeff-bezos-not-worlds-richest/">Jeff Bezos’ weirdly fearsome biceps</a>.</p>

<p>That’s what AWS does for Amazon. But what does Amazon do for AWS? Increasingly, as far as I can tell, bad things.</p>

<p>Let’s lay aside for a moment the whole regulatory question, whether AWS and Amazon will someday be trust-busted and broken up by force. The 2020 presidential candidates can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-amazon.html">hash that out</a>. Amazon is causing other political problems for AWS already.</p>

<p>Look, Amazon is huge; it’s owned by the richest man in the world, who increasingly owns <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-not-just-amazon-and-whole-foods-heres-jeff-bezos-enormous-empire-in-one-chart-2017-06-21">other things</a> as well. That means bad vibes from some other venture can poison AWS deals.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://defensesystems.com/articles/2018/07/26/jedi-hits-the-street.aspx">JEDI</a>, that $10 billion single-vendor Department of Defense contract AWS has been craving for what seems like years? Apparently the whole bid process <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/07/18/jedi_cloud_donald_trump/">is now on hold</a>, not because of anything AWS did wrong, but because, well, Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which Donald Trump does not appreciate, and so it’s all a mess. (Also, I love that Oracle has been apparently fomenting all this strife via Machiavellian backstage dealings, which I guess is Oracle’s whole brand now.)</p>

<p>There’s also the issue of AWS selling technology, directly or indirectly, to government agencies and police forces who use it for dubious purposes like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/22/17492106/amazon-ice-facial-recognition-internal-letter-protest">facial recognition</a>. Werner Vogels’ recent AWS Summit keynote address suffered <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/protesters-disrupt-amazon-event-over-its-ties-with-ice-11562882825">no fewer than five interruptions</a> from protesters angry that AWS services support the operations of US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

<p>While this might seem to be AWS’s problem, I guarantee that the name recognition of Amazon among everyday consumers drives a lot of the public outrage. (That’s why you often see Amazon-dot-com protests misdirected at AWS events. I’ve seen protesters interrupt an AWS summit with signs and shouts about Amazon warehouse conditions. The lines are blurry and it’s no wonder people get confused.)</p>

<p>Take Amazon out of the equation, and for better or worse the scrutiny of AWS goes down. To put it another way, there’s like a 50% chance that anyone running a big Oracle cluster at this point is a supervillain, but you don’t see Oracle getting protested.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the public sector issues, we have Gartner’s new magic quadrant report (I know, stay with me) <a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/aws-azure-and-google-top-gartners-iaas-magic-quadrant-528501">reminding us</a> that many companies, particularly retailers, are now eschewing AWS out of an existential fear that they are funneling dollars indirectly to their biggest competitor. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/least-one-retailer-online-outlet-zulily-still-willing-sign-amazon-web-services/">Walmart, Target, and Kroger</a> are all notorious for their no-AWS tech policies, with Amazon’s 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods apparently the last straw.</p>

<p>This is bad enough, but survivable: AWS can and does thrive without Walmart’s business. But Walmart actually takes their policy a lot further: they now <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/walmart-forces-tech-partners-to-leave-aws-following-whole-foods-acquisition/">require their tech partners to stay off AWS as well</a>. These retailers (and <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/06/09/nearly-50-of-health-systems-see-amazon-as-a-threat/">healthcare providers</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/16/why-volkswagen-chose-microsoft-azure-over-aws.html">car companies</a>, and whatever industry Amazon disrupts next) are fighting for their lives, and they’ll play every card they hold to swing their sizable partner ecosystems toward Microsoft or Google. The competing cloud platforms, for their part, are perfectly willing to push this narrative, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/12/microsoft-google-cloud-pitch-vs-aws-we-wont-compete-with-you.html">swearing up and down</a> that they won’t “compete with partners”.</p>

<p>So here’s the reality on the ground. I just got back from <a href="https://www.dashcon.io/talks/when-bad-architectures-happen-to-good-people/">speaking at Dash</a>, Datadog’s New York conference focused on next-generation ops and infrastructure (though mostly, let’s be real, focused on Datadog). I took an informal survey of tech leads there, people building SaaS platforms for everything from real estate to nonprofits to IoT. Not things Amazon competes with directly. But nearly all of these vendors have, or want to believe that they will land, the kind of big customer that may have a “no AWS” policy.</p>

<p>So with few exceptions, they are hedging their bets. They build on containers in a misplaced belief that will make quick migrations easier, they architect dubious “multi-cloud” workloads … the point is, they’re not using AWS the way it’s designed to be used, as a holistic, deeply integrated platform, and the looming shadow of Amazon is the reason why.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole “I can’t go all-in on AWS because some of my own customers might distrust AWS, because they in turn fear Amazon” thing is such a delightfully screwy reason for making suboptimal tech choices. It reminds me of the old fundamentalist idea of <a href="https://www.patheos.com/blogs/religionnow/2017/10/secondary-separation-islam/">secondary separation</a>, where you shun an innocent person because they’ve insufficiently disassociated themselves from heretics.</p>

<p>The problem with secondary separation, as the fundamentalists discovered, is that it has no logical stopping point. What degree of separation is enough? How many layers of vendors must you purge before you can be sure you’re not bankrolling heresy, or Amazon? The whole conversation is faintly dumb, but it’s <em>happening</em>, and that’s a problem for AWS as much as for the engineering teams who have to work around them.</p>

<p>So let’s recap the reasons Amazon may be harming AWS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Amazon’s name recognition creates a target on AWS’s back when they want to work in politically-charged areas</p></li>

<li><p>Jeff Bezos’s other business ventures and feud with the president jeopardize AWS’s government contracts</p></li>

<li><p>Companies that compete with Amazon don’t want to use AWS services</p></li>

<li><p>Companies that want to attract business from Amazon competitors avoid AWS, or use it less fully</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these things are that bad on their own, at least not yet. But they all keep AWS from being the best, most juggernaut-y version of itself. They keep AWS’s services from competing on equal footing in the marketplace. And that’s a shame, because the tech itself is often pretty great.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-galloway-amazon-will-spin-off-amazon-web-services-ignition-2018-12">some smart people</a> think Amazon will eventually have to spin off AWS just because AWS would be so valuable and do so well in the market as a “pure cloud” player. But AWS is a victim of its own success. It’s not going anywhere because Amazon depends on it. And as Amazon expands to threaten more industries, AWS may paradoxically become less successful. It’s a weird bind.</p>

<p>At any rate, unless something big changes in the regulatory landscape, Amazon and AWS will probably remain joined at the hip. And I’ll keep having frustrating conversations with more and more clients about why they can’t use the best cloud services on the market.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I work for an AWS consulting partner, but I own no $AMZN stock and have no direct interest in what Amazon does with AWS.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>ServerlessConf is <a href="https://nyc2019.serverlessconf.io/">coming up again</a> in October! Check out the <a href="https://nyc2019.serverlessconf.io/agenda.html">agenda</a> and make plans to join me in NYC for the hottest conference in the cloud. There’s a great balance of speakers, both serverless “old-timers” and new faces, and a heavy concentration of hands-on use case stories. Should be a lot of fun.</p></li>

<li><p>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M215idpHA6E">recording</a> of a recent webinar I did with AWS and Epsagon on modern application development. If the word “webinar” makes your eyes go glassy, call it a “parley” or a “confabulation”. There’s a lot of good material in there.</p></li>

<li><p>I wrote up <a href="https://dev.to/trek10inc/ci-cd-aws-and-serverless-5-tips-i-learned-the-hard-way-223p">a few tips</a> learned the hard way about serverless CI/CD on AWS.</p></li>

<li><p>Jared Short and I are trying an experiment with <a href="https://serverless.help/">serverless.help</a> – submit your serverless question, we’ll answer it and add it to a public repository so others can benefit. It’s a conscious effort to get more shared knowledge out of Slack groups and back onto the public web. You can also add your own questions and answers directly to the <a href="https://github.com/trek10inc/serverless.help">repo</a>.</p></li>

These typically not-for-profit collectives typically focused on establishing common standards that would help them share information from one server to another (i.e. messages or files), and in doing so, make it easier to collaborate on future technologies, projects and ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet’s quirky provenance is responsible for many of its best modern attributes. Today, everyone can create content on the internet, everyone is technically capable of accessing everything on the internet, and every web page on the internet can connect to another without the user needing to change browser, device or client. This flexibility, interoperability and universality isn’t by decree - there’s no Head of the Internet mandating the right to create, host or access/connect to a website.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, this is a byproduct of the internet’s open standards, programming, markup languages and so on. These ensure that a user doesn’t need to pay for a web browser or to load a website, nor does the owner of a website need to pay for the code used by their website. Services like Zoom also work because they leverage actively maintained standards that are free to use and designed to support any device. Every device maker needs to support these standards in order to have happy customers. Some of us now recoil against aggressive data collection, ad insertions and tracking, but this is partly because we don’t <em>need</em> to give these up. The use of standards, such as HTML, means that browser extensions can block ads or tracking. We may be willing to give up data for a free service, but the Internet’s makeup means we don’t have to.</p><p>The benefits here are hard to overstate. But just imagine, for example, how the internet might differ if it had been created by multinational media conglomerates in order to sell things, serve ads or harvest user data for profits. Downloading a .JPG could cost money, with a .PNG costing 50% more. Teleconferencing software might have required the use of a broadband operator’s app or portal (e.g. Welcome to your Xfinity Browser™, click here for Xfinitybook™ or XfinityCalls™ powered by Zoom™). Websites might only work in Internet Explorer <em>or</em> Chrome - and need to pay a given browser an annual fee for the privilege. Or maybe users would need to pay their broadband provider extra fees to read certain programming languages or use a given web technology (“This website requires Xfinity Premium with 3D Rendering”). Regardless of the specific differences, it’s likely internet penetration would be lower, as would usage and associated commerce.</p><p>The web’s cross-platform, standards-based and non-profit origins are inseparable from the internet’s rapid growth, the trillions of dollars in companies that have been founded over the past 30 years, and the positive societal impact of these companies (e.g. a drop in the cost and increase in the quality of communications, the reduction in gatekeeper power, lowered transaction fees, etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s heavily conglomerated internet giants remain mindful of the fact that open APIs, common standards, exportable data, etc., all help grow both the internet technology acceptance model and, in most cases, their own bottom lines. But these companies are less concerned with how the overall market grows than their share and control of this growth. Technology companies, almost by definition, prefer that the market build on top of or through them than have new entrants build around or in competition with them. As a result, the same companies that emerged thanks to openness tend to reject these principles where they might undermine their strategic position.</p><p>This isn’t an unusual disposition for a for-profit company, but the implications are particularly powerful in digital markets. In the offline world, free market economics enable robust competition that typically delivers the best products, variety and prices for consumers, and moderates the power of the strongest market players (if only due to diseconomies of scale). Online, incredibly powerful network effects and zero-cost marginal revenues/distribution has enabled dominant platforms to push back against the open nature of the internet, forcing consumers and creators to use them as universal intermediaries, and subduing standard market forces.</p><p>Right now, we are on the cusp of the next internet. The terms used for this future vary and the degree to which you believe in one label or vision is not particularly relevant. And the technologies to design, enable and support the fullest version of this are as far from the capabilities of 2021 as the 1990s Internet is from us today. But what matters is that a growing share of our time will be spent within virtual spaces and with virtual goods — for education, work, health, politics and leisure. Sometimes these spaces and goods will be purely virtual, other times virtual twins of physical ones, and sometimes augmented reality. For related reasons, a growing percentage of our income will be spent on virtual assets, goods, experiences — many of which we’ll be able to sell, trade, share, use or improve. And of course, enormous new industries, marketplaces and resources will emerge to enable these opportunities, with novel types of labor, skills, professions and certifications invented to serve them.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no way for this future to be developed as the original internet was. The US government and public research institutions led the development of the information superhighway in part because few in private businesses understood the commercial potential of a World Wide Web, but also because these non-profits were essentially the only entities with the computational talent, resources and ambitions to build it. Conversely, all of today’s mega-tech companies are deep believers in this future internet, and are best positioned (via resources and talent) to build it.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important impediment today is Apple. Although no company has done more to propel the last 15 years of the internet, its policies are unlikely to produce the most prosperous overall ecosystem and do not lay a strong groundwork for the “next Internet”. Instead, Apple is inhibiting this future Internet. And it does so via tolls, controls, and technologies that not only deny what made and still makes the open web so powerful, but also prevents competition, and prioritize Apple’s own profits.</p><p><span><strong>Chapter Two: There’s Apple, then GAFM</strong></span></p><p>Apple’s adverse effects stem from three interconnected and increasingly powerful elements.</p><p>First, Apple believes it knows better than consumers, the developer community, and the market at large. This includes which technologies should be adopted by the internet community, the role of user agency (and the extent to which users are capable of informed consent), and common business practices around user data, privacy and security.</p><p>This disposition led Apple to limit the role of the marketplace <em>on its </em>device (something the company did not do for the Mac). Specifically, Apple mandates that on its devices:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>All applications would need to be distributed by the Apple App Store, and could not be directly downloaded from the app maker or a third party app store</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the App Store would need to be approved by Apple, and approval would be contingent upon an extensive list of policies and requirements</p></li><li><p>All applications distributed by the Apple App Store would need to conform with the App Store’s billing policies, which typically meant that Apple was the exclusive in-app biller for iOS applications</p></li></ol><p>These three layers are technically different — the ability to use an operating system driver has nothing to do with the ability to distribute an app to the consumer or charge for them for a given piece of content or function. However, Apple’s iOS devices forced them together. If a developer wants to make an app, they need access to native drivers. And if a developer wants access to native drivers, their apps need to be distributed by the App Store. And if they want to use the App Store, they must adhere to Apple’s policies, which means using Apple’s billing systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple’s control and integration allowed it to offer a best-in-class mobile experience that also helped repel the most pernicious aspects of the online world; onboard and engage less technically savvy users; and develop a richly monetized app ecosystem. This, in turn, led to unprecedented success. <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/8/18/app-stores">Today, the iPhone has 66% market share in the United States, 75% of U.S. App Store revenues, and over 80% of time spent on the mobile internet</a> (iOS’s share of physical e-commerce transactions is likely somewhere in the middle of this range). And this dominance is also growing. Eighty percent of U.S. teenagers have iPhones and the device held 90% of smartphone activations in the week after Christmas 2020.</p><p>While Apple’s closed approach is why the company’s products are so successful, it’s success is also the reason why its closed approach has become so onerous. There is no proprietary, closed system that affects more lives on a daily basis than that of iOS. Due to this fact, Apple has become a de facto regulator for the internet; a single for-profit body that wields enormous soft, hard, and even accidental power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are almost no large companies in the world that can live without a mobile app (these …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>In my <a href="https://about.scarf.sh/post/shea-levy-composition-fanatic">previous post</a>, I remarked on the fact that composition, while central to our work as engineers, is often poorly supported by the tools we use. In this post I want to explore a specific trend away from this state of affairs, where composition is given the first-class treatment it deserves.</p><p>When engineering with atoms, composing components often consists of literally putting them together: you take piece A, move it close to piece B, and combine them by inserting tab X into slot Y. Sometimes an analogous case occurs in software: developers may instantiate instances of two particular design patterns in a class definition and compose them by ensuring the overlap meets both requirements, or copy in a template or project scaffold to compose a general structure with their specific use case.</p><p>Most of the time, however, software engineers compose by <em>reference</em>, making one part of the system conform to the interface of another and indirectly interact with the component exposing the interface through some pointer, handle, or name. These layers of indirection allow for more efficient reuse of components, clearer conceptual boundaries, and more specialized and dynamic composition. This benefits both the humans using the tools and the automated systems operating behind the scenes, at various time scales. Composition by named reference is so fundamental that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">one of the two foundational models of computation</a> revolves exclusively around referencing by name and resolving those references!</p><h2>Programming and networking</h2><p>Traditionally, most sophisticated name-based composition acted at the levels of building programs or of connecting entire machines.</p><p>Composition by name is ubiquitous in programming. We reference packages we want to use by a name and a version. We identify libraries we depend on by name. We call functions, consume data, implement interfaces, etc., all via their names. Then our tools take over: Our editors provide us documentation by name, our compilers look up type information and calling conventions by name, our static and dynamic linkers connect needed functionality across binary components by name.</p><p>Any user of post-Internet computers is intimately familiar with our industry's other venerable usage of names: finding another machine on the network. Every time you type a URL in your search bar, click a link, or configure an application to point to some specific service, you are composing computer resources by name. The most systematized and sophisticated aspect of these names is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">domain name system</a>, which gives you a high quality way to connect a top level name to a specific machine. Most of the rest of the URL is particular to each individual system, with at best weak conventions governing their use and meaning. But for both human and machine consumers, the domain name contains very precise semantics for composition at the machine level.</p><p>These names are not only crucial operationally, to put everything together in the system, they are also crucial cognitively, to put everything together in our minds. It's a clichéd joke that naming something is one of the two hardest problems in computer science, but that joke is based on the very serious fact that a name lets us treat a complex system as a single unit, and a good name helps us do that effectively.</p><p>DNS and programming language symbol resolution are at this point completely entrenched. They've been around in the relevant forms for the entire productive career of a huge portion of our industry. In more recent decades, however, some new approaches to name-based composition in new domains have emerged.</p><h2>Semantically-meaningful resource naming</h2><p>After the previous section, some of you may be wondering: What about the filesystem? It's true that files and other system resources have long been named by strings, with some weak structure for navigating trees of resources (i.e., the directory separator) and, on some systems, the type of file being named (the file extension). Similarly, other resources have long been referenced by name: <a href="https://google.com/">https://google.com</a> names not the server at google.com, but the specific HTTPS service exposed by that server over TCP port 443.</p><p>The problem with these and other naming systems is that they put too much of the work of composition onto the users. With a few minor exceptions like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard">filesystem hierarchy standard</a> and file extensions, file paths tell you almost nothing about the file in question that you didn't already know. Almost no one looks at the full URL of a hyperlink and extracts meaningful information from it that wasn't present in the context of the link. This results in the status quo: these names are almost always treated as fully opaque identifiers, and very few common naming rules apply across teams and systems.</p><p>Some systems have taken steps to move beyond this situation, however. In this section I will briefly cover a few novel tools that in some cases have succeeded in and in others promise to provide <em>semantically meaningful</em> names to compose different computational resources.</p><h3>git</h3><p>I assume most of you are familiar with <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, at a high level. At a primitive level, git operates on various types of <em>objects</em>, such as blobs, commits, or symlinks. At the human interface level, many of these objects are ultimately referenced by ad hoc unstructured names, such as "file x/y/z on branch foo". That being said, you've probably seen commits referenced by a <em>hash</em>, such as 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb. Hashes like this are what the human-readable names are translated into, and how all of the objects internally refer to each other.</p><p>What do the hashes mean? Each object can be <em>serialized</em>, i.e. written to a file such that it can be correctly reconstructed later, including references to any other objects it depends on. These serializations are <em>canonical</em>, such that any two objects that are the same will have byte for byte the same serialization. Using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a> on the contents of these serialized files then allows the git tools to give each object a short name that captures the full information content of the object, modulo unlikely hash collisions. We therefore call these <em>content-addressed</em> names.</p><p>Why should we use content-addressed names? In short, because they allow different components of the system to cheaply refer to each other with a high degree of reliability: If some commit object says that its associated filesystem tree has some file at a particular path, I know that whenever I refer to that file via relative references from the commit, I will get a file with exactly the same contents.</p><p>This allows for safe deduplication of files across commits and efficient communication protocols for distributing repositories across the network. It also gives a much more precise meaning to the names in question: "the file at x/y/z" can refer, at different times and on different systems, to any kind of file the relevant filesystem supports, whereas "the file at x/y/z in the tree of commit 4149457c6358f702fffbefcc2b7f6e8a87f802fb" refers, for most intents and purposes, to exactly one file with specific contents.</p><h3>Nix</h3><p><a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#ch-about-nix">Nix</a> is a package manager for Unix systems. It is built on several innovations, but the one relevant for this post is the Nix store, where the filesystem resources associated with packages are managed.</p><p>Like git, Nix manages some of its filesystem resources by content-addressed name, using essentially the same logic as git's hash-based content addressing. By themselves, however, such names are inadequate to Nix's goal of highly reliable and accurate dependency management with composition across packages. If I've built package foo 1.0 against some specific content-addressed instance of package bar 2.0, I can calculate the content and thus a content-addressed name of the resulting package. But if you want to build foo 1.0 against the newly released bar 2.1, you can't reuse anything in that content addressed name and must rebuild from scratch.</p><p>Nix addresses this issue with what I call <em>recipe-addressed</em> names: Some filesystem resources are named not by their own content but by the content of a serialization of <em>a deterministic build recipe</em> for creating it. The nature of these build recipes is such that it is much easier to substitute in different versions, configurations, etc. anywhere in the dependency tree and recalculate what the new name of the results should be.</p><p>With content-addressed names for bootstrapping, and recipe-addressed names for building up more complex packages, Nix opens up a whole new world of package management. Nix can ensure that many different machines, however different their configurations, have exactly the same package installed.</p><p>Nix can safely reuse common dependencies between packages, parallelize builds, and distribute builds across multiple machines. Large centralized binary caches are possible with a <a href="https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/">decentralized trust mechanism</a> built on top. On top of these capabilities, <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html#nixos">entire system configurations</a> can be deterministically captured in a single name, allowing reproducible deployments and much more reliable migration of personal systems across computers.</p><h3>Nelson</h3><p><a href="https://getnelson.io/">Nelson</a> is a "cloud-native" service orchestration framework built to take advantage of modern distribution, resource management, and coordination mechanisms. Among other things, Nelson enables deploying an <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure">immutable infrastructure</a>-style network topology while retaining efficient garbage collection of unneeded services. Nelson achieves this by requiring services to reference each other via name resolution mechanisms it populates from high level service configurations. Each service configuration specifies the other services it depends upon, providing both a service name, which has meaning to the user, and a <a href="https://semver.org/"><em>semantic version</em></a>, which contains information about cross-version compatibility. Nelson leverages the information in the dependency specification and keeps track of which services depend on which, allowing it to safely remove old instances of services that are not …</p></div></div></div></div>

Let's go over a simple problem to see how this can be useful.</p><p>For this problem, we are given an array <code>arr</code>, and a subarray size <code>k</code>, and we are asked to find the <em>average</em> of <em>all</em> subarrays in <code>arr</code> of size <code>k</code>. So given an array like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> and a subarray size <code>k = 2</code>, the correct answer would be <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code> because:</p><ul><li><code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> has three subarrays of size 2, namely <code>[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]</code>.</li><li>The average of the first subarray is <code>1 + 2 / 2 = 1.5</code>, the average of the second is <code>2.5</code> (using the same formula), and the average of the third is <code>3.5</code>.</li><li>Putting this together we get the final result <code>[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]</code>.</li></ul><p>Given these steps, it seems pretty clear that in designing an algorithm to solve this problem we would have to (1) iterate through every subarray then (2) find the average of each and append it to the result array.</p><p>A straightforward way to find every subarray of an array is to iterate through each index of the array and <em>construct</em> the subarray that begins at that index by iterating <code>k</code> more times. In this second iteration we can also sum up the numbers to compute the resulting average. Here's what that would look like:</p><p>Doing that for <em>every</em> index in the array, we get the final algorithm:</p><p>Notice the number on the top right of the animation. This number represents the total number of steps required to compute the result given the inputs <code>arr</code> and <code>k</code>. Try adding two more items and see how that number changes—it went up, by a <em>lot</em>.</p><p>Is there a better way?</p><p>Looking back at the algorithm, notice that most of the time we're counting numbers that we've already included before. Let's look at the animation again, this time highlighting all the double counts in red:</p><p>When the algorithm finishes, only 2 elements <strong>were not double counted!</strong> It turns out that no matter what inputs, this implementation will <em>always</em> double count every element except for the first and the last (try playing around with the inputs to convince yourself).</p><p>So why are we double counting in the first place? If we look at the first two subarrays, we see there's a lot of overlap:</p><p>What if, on each step, we only take into account the <em>differences</em> instead? In other words, is there a way to get the sum of the second subarray from the sum of the first? If so, we would be able to <em>derive</em> the sum of the second subarray rather than recounting every element again.</p><p>In the example above, we can get the sum of the <strong>second subarray by subtracting 1 and adding 5</strong> to the sum of the first.</p><p>This reduces the sum computation from <code>k</code> iterations to only one iteration! This is also where the sliding window namesake comes from—it's as if we have a window of 4 items that we <em>slide</em> to the next subarray.</p><p>Maybe adding a border around the items would make the window more clear:</p><p>With this key insight let's rewrite the algorithm. Remember that the algorithm receives two inputs - an array of numbers <code>arr</code> and a size of subarray <code>k</code>.</p><ol><li>At the start, we <em>build</em> the window—iterate until our window contains <code>k</code> items—while keeping track of the sum.</li><li>Then, we <em>slide</em> the window one item over, updating the sum by subtracting the item no longer in the window and adding the item that was added to the window. By doing this we ensure that the sum stays in sync with the items that are in the window.</li><li>With this sum we can compute the average as before.</li></ol><p>And that's the find all averages problem using the sliding window pattern! Notice how this implementation only needs 7 steps to calculate the sum instead of 13 with the previous implementation. Now that doesn't seem to be too big of a difference, but look how blazing fast the optimal implementation is compared to our previous one:</p><p>While the window is building, both algorithms are going at the same pace (try changing the size of k to equal to the size of the array—both algorithms will finish at the same time!). However, once the window is complete, the optimal algorithm blazes off and terminates in less than half the time it takes for the naive algorithm to finish.</p><h2>Generalizing the Pattern</h2><p>Of course we're not limited to only counting averages. The sliding window pattern can be generalized to any problem that involves computing <em>something</em> in the subarray. As long as the problem has some definition of a window size, the pattern essentially boils down to:</p><ol><li>Maintaining some <strong>state</strong> in that window, and</li><li>keeping that state in sync with the items in the window through <strong>constant-time operations</strong>.</li></ol><p>By "constant-time operations" I mean without using further iterations and only using the stuff that leaves/enters the window.</p><p>In the case of the averages problem, the state that we're maintaining is the <strong>sum of the items</strong>. We're keeping this sum in sync with the items in the window by subtracting the item that's leaving and adding the item that's entering.</p><h3>Permutation in a String</h3><p>Here's another problem that makes use of the same concept of maintaining state and synchronizing that state. The problem's pretty simple—given a string and some pattern, determine if the string contains any <em>permutation</em> of that pattern. For example, given the string <code>aaacb</code> and the pattern <code>abc</code>, the algorithm should return <code>true</code> because the substring <code>acb</code> is a permutation of <code>abc</code>.</p><p>This is not as obvious of a sliding window problem than the problem we just worked through, but if you think of a string as an array of characters and a substring as a subarray, then the similarities start to show.</p><p>I'm not going to walk through each logical step to get to the optimal solution (that would take a minute!), but here are the main ideas:</p><ol><li>A string can only be a permutation of another if it's the same length. <em>This gives us the size of the window = <code>pattern.length</code></em>.</li><li>A string is <strong>exactly</strong> a permutation of another if it contains the exact same number of letters. A way to keep track of this is through a map of character -&gt; count pairs. <em>This gives us the state that we have to maintain</em>.</li><li>We need a way to update <em>and compare</em> the map in constant time. <em>Through this we fulfill the second condition of synchronizing state through constant operations</em>.</li></ol><p>With those ideas, here's the final solution:</p><p>If you're interested in more details of the algorithm (particularly the constant-time updates and comparison), open the note below!</p></article></main></div></div>]]>

				<p>Kubernetes has demonstrated the power of a well architected control plane with a great API. The industry is beginning to notice that this control plane can be used to do much more than orchestrate containers, and are increasingly looking to use the Kubernetes control plane to manage all of their infrastructure.</p><p>Several “cloud provider infrastructure” addons exist for Kubernetes. These addons provide a Kubernetes interface to a cloud provider’s infrastructure - databases, queues, etc. The three major clouds each maintain their own - Google Config Connector, Azure Service Operator, and Amazon Controllers for Kubernetes. Each exposes their respective cloud’s control plane APIs as custom resources, allowing Kubernetes users to manage an RDS instance (for example) using the same tools they would use to manage a <code>Deployment</code> or a <code>ConfigMap</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/HeaderHero.svg"><figcaption>Crossplane exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources.</figcaption></figure><p>Crossplane is often compared to the various cloud provider infrastructure addons. There are certainly similarities - it is also a Kubernetes addon, and it also exposes all of the major cloud provider control plane APIs as custom resources. Crossplane even <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/accelerating-crossplane-provider-coverage-with-ack-and-azure-code-generation-towards-100-percent-coverage-of-all-cloud-services/">shares code with some of these addons</a>. Where Crossplane differs is in how we expose cloud provider APIs.</p><blockquote>
<p>The Crossplane community believes that the typical developer using Kubernetes to deploy their application shouldn’t have to deal with low level infrastructure APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drawing on our experiences as platform builders, SREs, and application developers we’ve designed Crossplane as a toolkit to build your own custom resources on top of any API - often those of the cloud providers. We think this approach is critical to enable <em>usable</em> self-service infrastructure in Kubernetes.</p><p>In this post we’ll demonstrate that seemingly simple tasks like spinning up a new database in the cloud for your applications to consume can often be more complicated than it would at first seem, and how Crossplane is designed to help tame that complexity.</p><p>Crossplane today consists of three things:</p><ol><li><em>Providers</em> extend Crossplane with custom resources that can be used to declaratively configure a system. The AWS provider for example, adds custom resources for AWS services like RDS and S3. We call these ‘managed resources’. Managed resources match the APIs of the system they represent as closely as possible, but they’re also opinionated. Common functionality like status conditions and references work the same no matter which provider you’re using - all managed resources comply with the Crossplane Resource Model, or XRM.</li><li><em>Composition</em> allows a platform team to define new custom resources that are composed of managed resources. We call these composite resources, or XRs. An XR typically groups together a handful of managed resources into one logical resource, exposing only the settings that the platform team deems useful and deferring the rest to an API-server-side template we call a ‘Composition’.</li><li><em>Packages</em> allow a platform team to quickly package, share, and declaratively install new kinds of composite resources and the providers they build on.</li></ol><blockquote>Despite the name, “provider” doesn’t necessarily mean “cloud provider”. Crossplane has providers that add support for managing databases on a SQL server, managing Helm releases, and <a href="https://blog.crossplane.io/providers-101-ordering-pizza-with-kubernetes-and-crossplane/">ordering pizza</a>.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/Crossplanecity.svg"><figcaption>When we founded Crossplane we focused on supporting the most useful resources.</figcaption></figure><p>When we founded the Crossplane project we started at the managed resource layer. We focused on the resources we thought would be the most useful to application developers - things like cloud databases, caches, and storage buckets. We quickly heard from early adopters that being able to spin up these resources alone <em>wasn’t enough</em>. An RDS instance might also need a security group or a subnet group to be reachable. GCP Cloud SQL instances and Azure SQL servers face similar issues. This pattern permeates cloud infrastructure; another example we see often is folks wanting to create an IAM policy for each DynamoDB table they create. </p><p>Let’s dig into the example of an application developer requesting an SQL database for their application to use. An experience you initially hope will look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: RDSInstance
metadata:
  name: example-rds
spec:
  forProvider:
    dbInstanceClass: db.t3.medium

<p>Can easily end up looking like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: database.aws.crossplane.io/v1beta1

</code></pre>
<p>You might notice that we create a database and a user in the above example - something the RDS API does not support natively.</p><blockquote>Sometimes spinning up practically functional infrastructure requires multiple providers - even if you only use one cloud. In this case we use the SQL provider to finish what we started with the AWS provider.</blockquote><p>This will be an imposing amount of configuration for some application developers. They want to be able to self service their infrastructure needs, but shouldn’t need to be experts in the features and functionality of cloud provider APIs to do so. This is where Composition comes in - it allows a platform team to offer their application developers an experience much closer to the one they originally envisioned. Using Composition the application developer experience can look like this:</p><pre><code>apiVersion: example.org/v1
kind: ExampleCoDatabase
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  parameters:
    storageGB: 20
    username: example-user
  compositionSelector:
    matchLabels:
      engine: mysql
      class: production
  writeConnectionSecretToRef:
    name: example-database-credentials 
</code></pre>
<p>This is a composite resource - an XR.</p><blockquote>When an application developer creates, updates, or deletes this XR Crossplane can create, update, or delete the more verbose set of managed resources from the previous example.</blockquote><p>Composition allows the infrastructure experts - the platform team - to determine what settings their application developers need, and how to use those settings to produce an RDS instance, security group, database, etc. In this example the application developer can influence the size of the database but not its backup settings, which are enforced by the platform team.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/02/CrossplaneConsole@2x.png"><figcaption>Framing your opinions at the API level fosters automation and eases integration.</figcaption></figure><p>You may wonder why a platform team would use Composition rather than a familiar, existing tool like Helm or Kustomize. While it’s true that there are similarities, we feel that it’s better to frame your organisation's opinions at the API level, rather than via client-side tooling. For example when you use Crossplane to expose the above purpose-built <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> API:</p><ul><li>Any REST client (from kubectl to curl to Python) can create an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> with a single API call. This fosters automation and eases integration with other systems.</li><li>Policy is enforced. RBAC can ensure at the API level that application developers may influence only the fields exposed by an <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. The platform team can ensure application developers have RBAC access to configure the settings they need, and nothing else.</li><li>RBAC is framed around your desired abstractions. Access is granted “to create an ExampleCo database”, not “to create an RDS instance, a security group, etc etc”.</li></ul><p>One novel design folks notice when they start using Crossplane is that most Crossplane custom resources are cluster scoped - they exist above the scope of any Kubernetes namespace. While this can seem odd at first, it’s another decision that was informed by real world scenarios.</p><p>Take the above <code>ExampleCoDatabase</code> XR. Assume that several teams of application developers, each with their own namespace, want …</p></section></div>

<p>If you understand the underlying concept of recursion but struggle to implement it like myself, or you don't even know what it is, then this post if for you.</p>
<p>Recursion is defined as solving a complex problem by breaking the problem into smaller versions of itself that can be solved. In programming, this is done by having a function call itself.</p>
<p>The underlying principle of recursion are these two cases:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case</strong>: this case defines the smallest instance of a problem. In certain recursive solutions, there can be multiple base cases but for the purpose of this post's explanation, my example will only incorporate one. When coding, the base case prevents an infinite loop of the function calling itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recursive Case</strong>: this case manipulates the problem in order to approach the base case. In programming, this is the case in which the function calls itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Put simply, the recursive case will breakdown the problem until it arrives at the base case, after which the the sub solutions build up to solve the original problem.</p>
<p>Do not worry if your understanding of recursion is hazy because the above definitions will make sense when implementing a recursive solution in Python.</p>
<h2 id="the-call-stack">The Call Stack</h2>
<p>In order to truly understand how recursion is implemented in Python, it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the call stack. </p>
<p>The call stack uses the stack data structure to keep track of local variables and previous function calls. The stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. This means that the last item to be placed in the stack will be the first to be removed. To help visualize, think of a stack of plates:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612217672194/K8ZCDamI8.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="brooke-lark-sG-PR0BNwb4-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>Whatever plate is placed last on the stack is the first one to be removed.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, the stack has two simple operations: push and pop. Push adds an item onto the stack and pop removes an item from the stack, returning its value.</p>
<p>In python, the call stack consists of frames. The bottom most frame is the global or module frame. This consists of all the global variables. Every time a function is called a new frame is pushed onto the stack containing its local variables and function arguments. When a function call returns, the frame is popped off the stack and its value is passed to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<h2 id="a-famous-recursion-example-factorial">A Famous Recursion Example - Factorial</h2>
<p>The factorial of a number is defined as so:</p>
<p>4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24</p>
<p>If we were to define the factorial of a number <code>n</code> as a mathematical equation, it would be:</p>
<p><code>factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)</code></p>
<p>The right side of the equation will be the <em>recursive case</em> of our solution. Notice, how the recursive case takes the original problem,<code>factorial(n)</code>, and makes it a simpler problem of multiplying <code>n</code> by whatever <code>factorial(n-1)</code> is.</p>
<p>We can define a function <code>factorial</code> that takes a parameter <code>n</code>. However, if we only defined this function with the above equation, it would call itself infinitely leading to an error.</p>
<p>This is because we did not define a <em>base case</em>. The most basic factorial is the factorial of 1 which equals 1. So we can tell the program that once it reaches the factorial of 1, instead of calling <code>1 * factorial(0)</code>, to just <code>return 1</code>. After which, the Python call stack will handle multiplying out the numbers.</p>
<p>After defining both the recursive and base cases, we arrive at the Python program below:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>factorial</span>(<span>n</span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> n &lt;= <span>1</span>:
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>else</span>:
        <span>return</span> n * factorial(n<span>-1</span>)
</code></pre><h2 id="in-depth-recursive-function-implementation">In Depth Recursive Function Implementation</h2>
<p>Before calling the factorial function, the Python call stack would look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222009642/RKv1SGozi.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 1 (3).png"></p>
<p>Then, we call the factorial function passing in an argument of 4. </p>
<pre><code><span>factorial</span>(<span>4</span>)
</code></pre><p>A frame for the factorial function would be pushed onto to the call stack, setting the argument <code>n</code> equal to <code>4</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222128046/cNmno7-YI.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 2.png"></p>
<p>The Python interpreter will then process the function and since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, it will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. However before the function can return a value, it must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code>. This will cause another factorial frame to be pushed on the stack, with the argument <code>n</code> set to <code>3</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222294743/zXgfi23TF.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 3.png"></p>
<p>Again, since <code>n</code> is not <code>&lt;= 1</code>, the function will evaluate <code>n * factorial(n-1)</code>. Likewise, the function must evaluate <code>factorial(n-1)</code> before returning a value. </p>
<p>This pattern will continue until the factorial frame with the argument n equal to 1 is pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222730246/6jJduzt8q.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 5 (1).png"></p>
<p>When this occurs, the function reaches the base case, so it instead returns 1. As I mentioned early when explaining the call stack, when a function returns, it pops its frame off the stack, transferring its value to where it was called in the previous frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222867866/Npx8dueYc.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 6.png"></p>
<p>Now since the value for <code>factorial(n-1)</code> has been evaluated, the factorial function can evaluate the product and return it to the previous frame, pushing the current frame off the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612222963799/kJ7D_a-7I.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 7.png"></p>
<p>This pattern continues until we reach the original function call...</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1612223032269/rxZsqVaa8.png?auto=compress" alt="Call Stack - 8.png"></p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the factorial function with argument 4 returns a value of 24.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>When writing a recursive solution in Python, think of the problem in terms of a base case and recursive case. Ask yourself: "How can I define a recursive case that will help me reduce the problem towards a base case?"</p>
<p>When trying to understand a recursive solution, I find it best to visualize the call stack in my head.  Every time a function is called an item is added onto the stack and any time you encounter the return keyword, it pops an item off the stack and returns its value to the previous function call.</p>

So once a developer is five or more years into their career, there’s a really good chance they’re still relying upon tools, libraries, and practices that are no longer the best way to build, deploy, and run software.</p><p>Case in point: Instagram, all on the public cloud, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2127343/Facebook-buys-Instagram-13-employees-share-100m-CEO-Kevin-Systrom-set-make-400m.html">sells to Facebook</a> for $1B with 13 employees in 2012; Bank of America <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-11-06-IBM-Developing-Worlds-First-Financial-Services-Ready-Public-Cloud-Bank-of-America-Joins-as-First-Collaborator">makes its first announcement</a> to do anything with the public cloud in November of 2019. Kevin Systrom <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-has-no-formal-programming-training-2012-4">had only just learned to program</a> when he started Instagram; Bank of America’s technology organization is run by people who are decades from being practitioners. (Lest anyone try to argue Bank of America’s slowness is due to regulatory issues, <a href="https://get.acloudguru.com/capital-one-case-study">consider Capital One</a>).</p><h4 id="h-senior-developers-can-be-a-solution-in-search-of-a-problem">Senior developers can be a solution in search of a problem</h4><p>Another problem with senior-developer-only organizations is that <strong>most organizations don’t have constant flows of work that require lots of experience</strong>. A tremendous amount of software development is updating interfaces to add functionality or improve usability, not building back ends from scratch that have to scale to hundreds of millions of daily users.</p><p>And as we have better and more powerful <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/">cloud services</a> to build on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, Netlify, Twilio, Stripe), more developer focus turns to interfaces. Having an organization filled with senior developers who aren’t mentoring junior developers is asking to find senior-developer problems to solve, even if they’re best solved by an existing service.</p><h2 id="h-finding-undervalued-people">Finding Undervalued People</h2><p>Many developers are systemically undervalued because they do not fit central casting for appearance or mentality. Others are undervalued because organizations typically aren’t willing to hire software developers who need some training to do the job effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, whatever cargo-cult exercise an individual had to learn to become an interviewer (e.g., inverting binary trees on a whiteboard) tends to be viewed like a fraternity hazing ritual: “I had to go through it, so I’ll make everyone else after me go through it.”</p><p>There are excellent software developers who hate hackathons and would rather spend time raising their children on weekends than on coding side projects. There are people who are neuroatypical who can’t deal well with your unrealistic, on-the-spot brain teasers. There are people who need some additional training and mentorship to be able to ship software effectively for most organizations. These people are all undervalued by the standard hiring practices in tech, which means that, with some effort on your part, they’ll give the highest return on investment of any hires you can make.</p><h2 id="h-when-you-invest-in-people-people-invest-in-you">When you invest in people, people invest in you</h2><p>Over the past twenty years, I have seen a real difference between hiring software developers with the view of, “You’re a superstar and we need you to come in and kick ass” versus, “We will bring you in, teach you how we think and build, and then you’ll help us achieve our mission.”</p><p>The former attitude can lead to developers thinking they are better than other departments and other people in the organization, because no one else can do what they do. (After all, they are superstars!) The latter is fundamentally aligning to a mission and a team and a culture.</p><p>Remember, all software developers pick up bad habits. They usually don’t know all the latest best practices. They generally haven’t been given work time and space to experiment with new technologies. They won’t know all of your code or your stack or how your teams’ specific approaches to software development. These generalizations hold true for all developers, junior to senior.</p><p>You can choose to not invest any effort into training and aligning senior developers and still see things ship, but that doesn’t mean that you’re growing cohesive teams that are making the right decisions for your organization. You should invest in bringing everyone up to speed and together. When you do that, you realize that <strong>bringing junior developers onboard is not necessarily a greater effort than bringing senior developers onboard</strong>, especially if your criteria for success is successful, happy teams that are making the best decisions.</p><h2 id="h-how-to-build-undervalued-talent">How to build undervalued talent</h2><p>If you hire undervalued people and you train them to be successful for your organization, you will end up with teams that are more aligned and more loyal to your mission. The right way to do this is to onboard people in stages that end up with developers working on your codebase, as opposed to hiring everyone with the expectation that they’re working high-priority tickets on day one.</p><p>For example, at Branch, we have a multi-stage process where entry-level developers are initially granted a stipend to fund living expenses while taking online courses, working through sample exercises, and attending office hours for any questions. The end of the first stage is completing the Branch take-home developer hiring exercise that we have used to hire all developers.</p><p>The second stage is a paid internship that has the goal of learning how to work as part of the development team, but having the space to go slowly and ask lots of questions, and the expectation that there may be many PR revisions. We identify tickets in our backlog as “intern” work, so that there isn’t high pressure to complete anything in a short period of time.</p><p>This entire process does take time from the existing development staff, but it can be contained (mostly) into onboarding, office hours, code reviews, and weekly 1-on-1s. And it allows you to make hiring decisions that exclude bad cultural fits because you will find enough talent by investing in your workforce. You’ll create a massive competitive advantage over your competitors who are still stuck in their fraternity-hazing ruts.</p><h2 id="h-the-roi-of-building-talent">The ROI of building talent</h2><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a delicious irony that so many venture-backed companies seek only to hire out of expensive four-year universities or people with experience working at other VC-backed startups, yet want their teams to be dedicated to the company's mission.</p><p>1/</p></div>— Joe Emison (@JoeEmison) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeEmison/status/1343222725226209280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2020</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>Many venture-backed companies seek people dedicated to their missions, but then shoot themselves in the foot by only looking to hire people from “elite” schools or out of “name-brand” venture-backed companies. Those hiring pools are filled with people who are ready and able to job-hop to further themselves, and are often very weakly committed to company missions. In contrast, if a company invests in undervalued people who need some mentorship, training, and experience to reach their full potential, those people are much more likely to commit to the company and the mission with their full selves.</p><p><em>Joe Emison is the CTO of Branch Insurance, which provides home and auto insurance.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past month, two things happened to me that made me realize how glad I'm for using a password manager, namely <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>First thing is about a login page. I was searching for a Github repo on DuckDuckGo, and I clicked on a link in the search results. As I was about to fill in the password with a 1Password shortcut, I noticed that 1Password wasn't filling in the login details. How strange, I thought. Puzzled, I looked at the url. And then I saw it—I almost fell for a phishing attack! The url was <a href="https://marcel.is/1password/github.com.cnpmjs.org">github.com.cnpmjs.org</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. I knew of phishing attacks, and thought I'd never fell for such a simple trick. Yet, I almost did.</p>
<p>Second thing is about email. As I'm migrating away from gmail, I thought I would check out the spam folder. I usually don't do that, but I thought I'd peek in. One email caught my eye: the email subject was my password. The site must have been compromised and the attacker got hold of my email and password. Fortunately, the damage radius was minimal, as I have generated unique passwords for each site.</p>

<p>Founders often ask me, what slides on my pitch deck do I have to make sure I get right? The short answer, all of them. Then again, if you’re focusing on all of them, you’re focusing on none of them. So I’ll break it down by fundraising stages:</p>



<ol><li>Pre-seed/seed (might as well include angels here too)</li><li>Series A/B</li></ol>



<p>Since I spend almost no time in the later stages, I’ll refrain from extrapolating from any anecdotes there.</p>



<p>If you’re using <a href="https://www.docsend.com/">DocSend</a>, you already have the numbers for your deck viewership in front of you. As DocSend’s CEO Russ Heddleston said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuzWbFztdDE&amp;t=2791s">interview with Jason Calacanis</a>, VCs often spend ~3.5 minutes on your deck. Though I’ve never timed myself, it seems to be in the same ballpark for myself as well. After all, it’s the deck that gets the meeting, not the deck that determines if you get funding or not.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I hope the below contextualizes the time spent beyond the numbers, and what goes on in an investor’s head when we’re skimming through.</p>



<h2>Pre-seed/seed</h2>



<h3><strong>Team</strong></h3>



<ol><li><em>What is the <a href="https://cupofzhou.com/the-different-types-of-risk-a-vc-evaluates/">biggest risk</a> this business is taking on?</em></li><li><em>Is the person who can address the biggest risk of this business on this slide?</em><ul><li>And does this person have decision-making power?</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>Let’s say your biggest risk is that you’re creating a market where there isn’t one. Do you have that marketing/positioning specialist – either yourself or on your team – to tackle this problem? As much as I love techies, three CS PhDs are going to give me doubts.</p>



<p>Similarly, the biggest risk for a hypothetical enterprise SaaS business is  often a sales risk. Then I need proof either via your network/experience or LOIs (letters of intent) that you have corporations who will buy your product.</p>



<p>Or if it’s a tech risk, I’ll be hesitant if I see two MBAs pursuing this. Even if their first hire is an ML engineer, who owns 2% of the business. Because it doesn’t sound like the one person who can solve the biggest risk for the business has been given the trust to make the decisions that will move the needle.</p>



<p>This might be a bit controversial, but having talked with several VCs, I know I’m not alone here. I don’t care about <em>quantity</em> – number of years in the industry or at X company. Maybe a little more if you were a founding team member who helped scale a startup to $100M ARR. I do care for <em>quality </em>– your earned secret, which bleeds into the next slide.</p>



<h3><strong>Solution/product</strong></h3>



<p>The million-dollar question here is: <em>What do you know that makes money that everyone else is overlooking, underestimating, or just totally missed?</em> If you’re a frequent reader of this blog, you’ll be no stranger to this question. I’ve talked about it <a href="https://cupofzhou.com/myths-around-startups-and-business-ideas/">here</a> and <a href="https://cupofzhou.com/competitive-awareness-as-a-founder/">here</a>, just to name a few.</p>



<p>Or in other words, having spent time in the <a href="https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze">idea maze</a>, what is your earned secret? Here are two more ways of looking at it is: </p>



<ol><li>Is there an inflection point you found, as <a href="https://ventureunlocked.substack.com/p/mikemaples019">Mike Maples Jr. of Floodgate calls</a> it, in the socio-economic/technological trends that makes the future you speak of more probable?</li><li>Is it a process/mental model that you’ve built over X years in the industry that grafts extremely well to an adjacent or a broader industry?</li></ol>



<p>I believe that’s what’ll greatly increase the chances of your startup winning. Or at least hold your incumbents at bay until you reach product-market fit. If you’re able to find the first insight, then you’ll be able to find the second. And by pattern recognition, you’ll be able to find the third, fourth, and fifth in extreme velocity. It’s what we, on the VC side, call insight development. And your product/solution is the culmination of everything you and your team has learned faster and better than your competitors.</p>



<p>Of course, your product still has to address your customers’ greatest pain points. You don’t have to be the best at everything, but you have to be the best (or <a href="https://cupofzhou.com/being-the-only/">the only</a>) one who can solve your customers’ greatest frustration. So VCs, in studying how you plot out the user journey, look for: do you actually solve what you claim this massive problem in the market is?</p>



<h2>Series A/B</h2>



<h3><strong>Traction</strong></h3>



<ul><li>What are your unit economics? I’m looking for something along the lines of LTV:CAC ~3-5x.</li><li>Who’s paying?<ul><li>For enterprise, which big logo is your customer? And who are your 5-7 referenceable customers?</li><li>For consumer:<ul><li>If it’s freemium, what percent of premium users do you have? I’m looking for at least a 3-5% here.</li><li>If your platform is free, how are people paying with their time? DAU/MAU&gt;25-30%? Is your virality coefficient k&gt;1? 30- and 90-day retention cohorts &gt; 20%, ideally 40%.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>What does your conversion funnel look like? What part of the funnel are you really winning? Subsequently, what might you need more work on?</li></ul>



<h3 id="competition"><strong>The competition</strong></h3>



<p>95 out of every 100 decks, I see two kinds of competitor slides:</p>



<ul><li>2×2 matrix/Cartesian <em>graph</em>, where the respective startup is on the upper right hand corner</li><li>The <em>checklist</em>, where the respective startup has all the boxes checked and their competitors have some percentage of the boxes checked</li></ul>



<p>Neither are inherently wrong in nature, but they give rise to two different sets of questions.</p>



<p>The former, the <em>graph</em>, often leads to the trap of including <em>vanity competitors</em>. For the sake of populating the graph, founders include the logos of companies who hypothetically could be their competitors, but when it comes down to reality, they never or rarely compete on a deal with their target user/customer. <a href="https://twitter.com/aprildunford">April Dunford</a>, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Obviously-Awesome-Product-Positioning-Customers/dp/1999023005/">Obviously Awesome</a>, calls these “<a href="https://twitter.com/aprildunford/status/1334143529573081089?s=20">theoretical competitors</a>.”</p>



<p>A simple heuristic is if you jumped on a call with a customer right now and ask: “What would you use currently if our solution did not exist?”, would the names of the competitors you listed actually pop up during the call? Or with a potential customer, what did they use before you arrived? For enterprise software, Dunford says that startups usually lose <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/positioning">25% of their customers</a> when the answer to the above question is “nothing”. When your greatest incumbent is a habitual cycle deeply engrained in your user’s behavior, you need to either reposition your solution, or find ways to educate the market and greatly reduce the friction it takes to go from 0 to 60.</p>



<p>The latter, the <em>checklist</em>, usually sponsors a second kind of trap – <em>vanity features</em>. Founders often list a whole table’s worth of “awesome features” that their competitors don’t have, but many of which may not resolve a customer’s frustration. And on the one that does, their competitors have already taken significant market share. The key question here: Do all features listed resolve a fundamental problem your customers/users have? Which are necessary, which are nice-to-have’s? Are you winning on the features that solve fundamental problems?</p>



<p>The question I ask, as it pertains to competition, in the first or second meeting is: <em><a href="https://cupofzhou.com/competitive-awareness-as-a-founder/">What are your competitors doing right</a>?</em> If you were to put yourself in your competitor’s shoes, what did they ace and what can you learn from the success of their experiment?</p>



<h3><strong>Financial projections</strong></h3>



<ol><li><em>What are you basing the numbers off of?</em></li><li><em>What are your underlying assumptions?</em></li></ol>



<p>How fast do you claim you can double the business growth? Is it reasonable? If we’re calculating bottom-up, can you actually sell the number of units/subscriptions you claim to? What partnerships/distribution channels are you already in advanced talks with? Anything further than 2 years out, for the most part, VCs dismiss. The future is highly unpredictable. And the further out it is, the less likely you’re able to predict that.</p>



<p>I also say financial projections for Series A/B decks is because only with traction can you reasonably predict what the 12-month forward revenue is going to look like. Maybe 18 months, depending on your pending contracts as well. In the pre-seed/seed, when you’re still testing out the product with small set of beta users, it’s hard to predict. And pre-seed/seed decks that have projections without much traction are often heavily scrutinized than their counterparts that don’t have that slide.</p>



<h2>In closing</h2>



<p>Of course, that doesn’t mean you should neglect any slide on your deck. Rather, the above is just a lens for you to see which slides an investor might allocate special attention to. If you can answer the above questions well in your pitch deck, then you’re one step closer to a winning strategy not only in fundraising, but in building a company that will change the world.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>The Modern Single Board Computer such as the infamous Raspberry Pi are designed to run full fledged desktop operating systems, consume a tiny amount of power and be affordable for just about anyone. </p>



<div><p>What happens if the typical SBC is scaled down tenfold? What would someone do with such a device? </p><p>The Lichee Nano Pi is exactly this, the entire Computer is the size of an SD card, runs Linux and has 20 GPIO pins including SPI, TWI and UART. </p><p>Many would recognise this device as a micro controller along the lines of an Arduino Nano or RPI Pico although this is absolutely not the case. With 32MB of DDR SDRAM, 16MB SPI Flash and a 900MHz Arm 926EJS CPU its actually a very small computer! </p></div>



<p>Out of the box the Lichee Nano Pi supports the following Operating Systems:</p>



<ul><li>BSP Linux 3.10.</li><li>Mainline Linux 4.10.</li><li>RT-Thread</li></ul>



<p>Common Linux distributions are few and far between however community members have worked on various ports. Buildroot makes it simple to create a bootable install for either the built-in SPI flash or SD card. </p>



<p>Unfortunately Armbian have not released their distro for the Lichee Nano Pi. However I spent some time over the Xmas period to create a Debian port. </p>



<h2>Running Debian on the Lichee Nano Pi</h2>

<div><p>Debian runs almost flawlessly! Consuming just 7MB of RAM at idle there are plenty of resources free, the 900MHz ARM 926EJS CPU performs perfectly fine and networking is handled via a USB OTG Ethernet Adaptor – Whilst the SPIO Wifi module would work in Debian you do loose access to the Micro SD card slot and sadly a Debian install will not fit on the 16MB SPI flash. </p><p>You can find out how I created a Debian install over at my <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/lichee-nano-pi-will-it-run-debian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a>. <br>Find out more about my projects on <a href="https://twitter.com/jmdawson_blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. </p></div>

I think optimisation is generally great, but has common pitfalls, and it’s important to be aware of these and avoid them. To balance this, this post goes well with my posts on </em><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-9-what-it-means-to-optimise"><em>the dangers of naive optimisation</em></a><em> (and what to do about this), and </em><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/38-slack"><em>on the importance of leaving yourself Slack and spare capacity</em></a><em>, rather than trying to optimise every last moment of your life. See the Afterword for more thoughts)</em></p><p>Introduction</p><p>The 80/20 rule, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> is a “rule” in economics, saying that 80% of the value comes from 20% of the effort. It is weird to call this a rule, when it’s such a fuzzy, ill-defined statement. And it’s easy to come up with counter-examples. But this is an empirical observation about the world, and in my experience it tends to be true. </p><p>And I think this is an <em>incredibly </em>valuable idea - far more so than it seems at first glance. This is a <em>key </em>part of my worldview, and how I live my life. And I consider it an important underlying factor in ways I’ve been successful. The key insight is this: <strong>there is always a clever hack</strong>. The world is not fair. Effort is not distributed as it should be. And this isn’t because people are dumb, or not trying. <strong>This is the default state of the world</strong>. Allocating your effort efficiently is <em>hard</em> - if it wasn’t, then the Pareto Principle would not hold. And <strong>this is the default state of the world for <em>you</em></strong>.</p><p>My underlying model here is that we spend <strong>most of our lives stuck in bad local optima</strong>. We have a set of default actions, standard ways of doing things and solving problems we come across. And these are <em>way </em>better than nothing, but nowhere near optimal. So to get <em>out </em>of a local optima, you need to develop the skill of <strong>noticing </strong>when you’re in one, being <strong>creative </strong>to find a better way, and <strong>implementing </strong>that to move to a better one. In practice, this insight gets stored in my mind as a <em>conviction </em>that there is a clever hack, an efficient solution. I have a strong aesthetic preference against things that feel slow, effortful, or inefficient. </p><p>And <em>solving </em>this is not obvious, nor easy! You need to be creative. Sometimes I can’t find anything better, and do <em>even worse </em>than the naive solution. And you’ll never find a truly optimal solution because the world is complex and everything is uncertain - my new toolkit just gets me to other local optima. And it’s possible to feel overwhelmed by this, and dissatisfied with anything short of perfect. But this is something I find it easy to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-11-live-a-life-you-feel-excited-about">be excited about</a> - there is a core part of me that is always <em>striving</em>. Focused on progress, not on the end point. <strong>The world is full of inefficiency and wasted motion, but <em>you </em>can do better</strong>. </p><p>Note that I’m making a far broader claim than the Principle obviously implies. It just says that there is a lot of value left on the table, which most people miss. I assert that you<em> can </em>find it, with sufficient effort and skill. And this is an empirical claim about the world, not something you can logic your way into. It’s something I feel very convinced of, because it works for me. And my goal in this post is going to be to outline some of the common ways this manifests, what the mindset feels like from the inside, and ways this can go wrong.</p><p>This is the key insight underlying a lot of my previous posts - find ways that the default state of the world is wasted motion, and overcome them:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/the-value-of-experiments">Run experiments and try new things</a>, appreciate the value of information. This breaks you out of bad local optima</p></li><li><p>Be constantly results focused: <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/be-deliberate">Be deliberate</a>, and always keep your goal in mind. Build <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-19-on-systems-living-a-life-of-zero-willpower">systems</a> to take the right actions effortlessly. Stop <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-6-stop-pressing-the-try-harder-button">trying</a> and start doing. And learn <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-9-what-it-means-to-optimise">what it really means to optimise</a></p></li><li><p>Prioritise: <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/prioritisation">Find your true goals</a> and <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/2glo4ww7hd035m56cc5l7zq9r7bxhc">take the actions that best lead to them</a> - because otherwise you are in the default state of the world, and your life is full of wasted motion</p></li><li><p>One cause of wasted motion is being <em>passive</em>. Cultivate the <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/become-a-person-who-actually-does-things">identity of Doing Things</a>, overcome the <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-15-the-illusion-of-doing-nothing">illusion of doing nothing</a> and learn how to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-21-taking-the-first-step">take the first step</a></p></li><li><p>Notice when you’re being helpless about problems in your life, and remind yourself that <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-7-problems-are-for-fixing">problems are for fixing</a> </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-5-how-to-learn-from-conversations">Social skills</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-14-minds-should-make-sense">Empathy</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-18-how-to-teach-things-well">Teaching</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-10-seek-positive-externalities">Being a nice person</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-11-live-a-life-you-feel-excited-about">Intrinsic motivation</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-13-beliefs-are-for-true-things">True beliefs</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>If you want to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-8-what-altruism-means-to-me">improve the <em>world</em></a>, learn to overcome the wasted motion there</p></li></ul><p>Learning</p><p>One very salient case of this for me is learning, especially maths. The key insight is that <strong>learning is a process of information compression</strong>. </p><p>Maths is often taught as a stream of rigorous, formal information. You see a long stream of unmotivated, incomprehensible proofs, and are expected to study these in detail and remember them. But at the end of the day, I do <em>not </em>care about remembering a proof. I care about building <em>intuitions</em>. Concepts, and ideas, and motivation. A big picture framework in my head, from which I can <em>generate </em>the important parts of a course. </p><p><strong>80% of every proof is garbage</strong> - it’s a series of mindless algebra, and doing the obvious thing. When my goal is to <em>learn</em>, I want to find that 20% that is <em>insightful</em>, the steps that I would struggle to come up with myself</p><p>In practice, this manifests as a conviction that everything can be distilled down to key ideas and insights, and an impatience with implementation details. And sometimes the implementation details <em>are </em>important! It’s good to learn them a bit, and be able to generate them. But I find that most of the time, this conviction lets me cut past all the irrelevant crap, and find what actually matters. </p><p>Some tips: </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Every time you encounter an idea, ask why do I care about this idea? </p></li><li><p>Seek the big picture understanding - focus on concepts not details</p></li><li><p>If something feels hard, ask “is this important?” And if not, move on, or ask for help - you’ll spend 80% of your time chasing the 20% of the hardest details - check it’s worth your time first.</p></li><li><p>Every time you see a proof, compress it into as few bullet points as possible. </p></li><li><p>Whenever you solve a hard problem, ask yourself “what do I know now, such that this problem should feel <em>easy </em>next time” - those are the key lessons the problem have to teach you</p></li><li><p>Write notes in a <a href="https://dynalist.io/d/ToOhEKlz9qC2PmpjgyTpXQJz">format that forces you to brevity and clarity</a>, because it’s easy to fall into the trap of just copying down everything - to avoid wasted motion, you need to identify what <em>matters</em>. Learning is a process of information compression.</p></li></ul><p>The underlying point here is that my goal isn’t to be able to regurgitate proofs, it’s to achieve <em>mastery</em>. And mastery does not feel like having every detail memorised, it feels like getting to the point where I don’t <em>need </em>to have every detail memorised, because I know which details matter, which can be looked up later, and which can be safely forgotten about. And by having this impulse to impatience, and striving towards efficiency, I can get to mastery <em>far </em>faster.</p><p>And I’ve found that these skills transfer pretty well to other fields! Not universally - I’d be a pretty awful doctor for example - but I’ve found that all fields that have caught my interest (major selection bias) have underlying concepts and <em>important </em>ideas. That it’s useful to have this sense of impatience, and this desire for efficiency and a big picture view in my mind. That by remembering to <em>prioritise </em>I can learn far better.</p><p>I outline my views on all this in more detail in my post on <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-18-how-to-teach-things-well">teaching</a>, and I outline my thoughts on learning concepts from conversation <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-5-how-to-learn-from-conversations">here</a>. A further bit of empirical data for this belief is that I think it makes me a substantially better teacher, and get feedback to this effect.</p><p>Be results focused</p><p>One key source of wasted motion is a failure to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/be-deliberate">be deliberate</a>. And this makes sense! <strong>The default state of the world is wasted motion</strong>. This means that there is a constant fight against entropy, if you want to be focused and efficient. And keeping your eye on your true goal, is the key first step to finding the right path, out of the many options you have. So the first key skill is to be <strong>results-focused</strong> - be grounded, and be ever focused on what you’re aiming for.</p><p>And you don’t always get to know what you’re true goal is! And being overconfident about this is also a failure mode! But even if you’re confused about your true goals, you should always have <em>something </em>you’re aiming at - even if it’s just to learn more and become less confused.</p><p>Cut out the bullshit</p><p>And something often worth trying, if you notice barriers between you and your goal, yet can’t see good justifications behind the barriers, is to see what happens if you try skipping past them. This will <em>not </em>always work, and <strong>beware downside risk </strong>if you try this, but I’ve found it works far more than it has any right to. </p><p>One approach where I’ve had a lot of success with this centre on social things:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>If I want to become friends with somebody, and have interesting conversations about something meaningful, I <em>can</em>. You don’t have to be stuck in dull small talk - if you’re both interested in having a better conversation, try <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-5-how-to-learn-from-conversations">asking about the things you find genuinely exciting</a></p></li><li><p>If you’re having an argument with a friend - skip past all of the petty bullshit and remember that you’re on the same team. Clearly communicate your preferences, listen to their’s, and try to work together for the mutually best solution</p></li><li><p>If I want to <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-10-seek-positive-externalities">be a nicer person</a>, and improve the lives of those around me, I <em>can</em>. If I want to give people meaningful compliments more often, I <em>can</em>. And this feels kinda weird, but works.</p></li><li><p>If I don’t understand how somebody thinks, and this is a source of tension, I can just ask, and be curious, and <em>try </em>to understand them until their <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-14-minds-should-make-sense">mind makes sense</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Health warning</strong>: These are all actions that violate social norms, which different people have different comfort levels with. I’ve found I tend to surround myself with friends where this works well - this won’t necessarily generalise.  But I personally have found this approach makes me a <em>lot </em>happier, and works for me.</p></li></ul><p>The underlying lesson here: To break out of the default local optima, …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

  title: Avoiding false-positives with flow-sensitive conditional analysis

<p>Itâ€™s hard to develop a new static analysis tool for a language thatâ€™s been around a couple of decades â€” alarm bells go off in your usersâ€™ minds if your tool flags code that has worked fine for a dozen years.</p>
<p>Some relatively new static analysis tools have overcome this through a sort of argument from authority. TypeScriptâ€™s author can say â€œI have designed famous programming languages, trust me when I say your code is poorly-writtenâ€�.</p>
<p>I, however, have designed zero programming languages, so I have to be a little more accommodating when building a static analysis tool for PHP.</p>
<p>Psalm has a feature I'm calling flow-sensitive conditional analysis. <strike>I don't believe any similar tools employ it.</strike> Since writing this <a href="https://twitter.com/pkhuong">Paul Khuong</a> has pointed to Typed Racket as a modern type system that also performs this analysis, where it's more properly named <a href="https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/icfp10-thf.pdf">Occurrence Typing</a>.</p>
<p>This article will show how Psalmâ€™s analysis can help us avoid a false-positive on this snippet of code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class A {
    public function isValid() : bool {
        return (bool) rand(0, 1);
    }

    public function someAction() : void {}
}

function takesA(?A $a) : void {
    $valid_a = $a &amp;&amp; $a-&gt;isValid();

    if ($valid_a) {
        $a-&gt;someAction();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="flow-sensitive-type-analysis">Flow-sensitive typeÂ&nbsp;analysis</h2>
<p>Any type-inferring static analysis tool for dynamically-typed languages like PHP or JavaScript needs to perform flow-sensitive <em>type</em> analysis, meaning that the tool understands how the datatypes of variables change within a function given that functionâ€™s collection of statements and expressions.</p>
<p>At every point during the analysis of a given set of statements such tools keep a map of variable names with corresponding types, updating that map as they traverse the code's abstract syntax tree.</p>
<p>This allows those tools to infer that executing this code will never result in a null reference:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
function getStringOrDefault(?string $a) : string {
    if ($a === null) {
        return 'default';
    }
    
    return $a;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here Psalmâ€™s behaviour is similar to other static analysis tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>Psalm sees the conditional expression and generates a formula (in Conjunctive Normal Form) composed of a series of clauses. The <code>if</code> conditional <code>$a === null</code> is converted to the formula <code>($a is null)</code>. That formula represents all the things we know to be true inside the <code>if</code> block.</li>
<li>From this formula we generate a list of assertions that can be applied back to the types that are currently defined. To do this, we look for all clauses in our formula that contain just a single variable. In this case, thatâ€™s the clause with the  <code>($a is null)</code> assertion that we found earlier. We extract that clause, then reconcile it with the existing known type for <code>$a</code>, <code>string|null</code>, resulting in us setting the type of <code>$a</code> to <code>null</code>.</li>
<li>Psalm sees that the <code>if</code> block always returns as long as the formula we generated above evaluates to true, so after the <code>if</code> block Psalm knows that the formula <em>must</em> evaluate to false. Thus the negation of the formula is true after the <code>if</code> block.</li>
<li>Psalm calculates the negation of the formula as <code>($a is !null)</code> trivially.</li>
<li>As in step 2, it looks for clauses containing a single variable which can translate to a type assignment. Here we take the <code>($a is !null)</code> clause and reconcile it with the <code>string|null</code> type for <code>$a</code> to give us the type <code>string</code>.</li>
<li>Psalm can then determine that <code>return $a</code> always returns a string.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="flow-sensitive-conditional-analysis">Flow-sensitive conditionalÂ&nbsp;analysis</h2>
<p>While flow-sensitive type analysis keeps a map of variables and their respective types, flow-sensitive conditional analysis adds a list of conditionals it knows to be true at each point in the code.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s introduce some extra complexity to our function above and see how flow-sensitive conditional analysis is useful:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
function getStringsOrDefault(?string $a, ?string $b) : string {
    if ($a === null &amp;&amp; $b === null) {
        return "default";
    }
  
    if ($a !== null) {
        return $a;
    }
  
    return $b;   
}
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Psalm analyses the first conditional <code>$a === null &amp;&amp; $b === null</code>  and generates the formula <code>($a is null) &amp;&amp; ($b is null)</code>.</li>
<li>Psalm then looks for clauses containing a single variable assertion, and sees two â€” <code>($a is null)</code> and <code>($b is null)</code>. Psalm dutifully assigns <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> to null inside the if condition (though these assignments are never used).</li>
<li>Since the <code>if</code> block always returns when entered, the <code>if</code> condition must be false after it, so we compute the negation <code>!(($a is null) &amp;&amp; ($b is null))</code>  to get <code>($a is !null || $b is !null)</code>. This is a single clause, but since it contains two variables we cannot infer any types straight away. At this point tools that just perform flow-sensitive type analysis discard that negated formula, since the formula cannot translate directly into type assignments. But Psalm retains this information, stored as the set of conditions it knows to be true.</li>
<li>Now it encounters a new <code>if</code> condition <code>$a !== null</code>. It derives the formula <code>($a is !null)</code> and inside the <code>if</code> block it trivially determines <code>$a</code> has the type <code>string</code>
</li>
<li>After that second <code>if</code> condition Psalm then knows that <code>($a null)</code>. It combines that formula with the previously-generated formula <code>($a is !null || $b is !null)</code>.<br>
<code>($a is null) &amp;&amp; ($a is !null || $b is !null)</code> simplifies to<br>
<code>($b is !null)</code>.<br>
This gives us a clause with a single variable which allows us to determine that <code>$b</code> has the type <code>string</code>. <strong>Tools that just perform flow-sensitive type analysis emit a false-positive warning here.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If youâ€™re still with me, congratulations!</p>
<p>Knowing a bit about flow-sensitive conditional analysis, letâ€™s revisit the very first example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

class A {
    public function isValid() : bool {
        return (bool) rand(0, 1);
    }

    public function someAction() : void {}
}

function takesA(?A $a) : void {
    $valid_a = $a &amp;&amp; $a-&gt;isValid();

    if ($valid_a) {
        $a-&gt;someAction();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever Psalm encounters an assignment where the right-hand side is an AND/OR operation like this:</p>
<pre><code>$valid_a = $a &amp;&amp; $a-&gt;isValid();
</code></pre>
<p>It introduces a new condition to its list of conditions it knows to be true:</p>
<pre><code>($valid_a is falsy || (($a is !falsy) &amp;&amp; &lt;extra stuff&gt;))
</code></pre>
<p>In plain English â€œitâ€™s either the case that <code>$valid_a</code> is <code>falsy</code> <em>or</em> itâ€™s the case that <code>$a</code> is not falsyâ€�.</p>
<p>Since we store everything in Conjunctive Normal Form this becomes</p>
<pre><code>($valid_a is falsy || $a is !falsy)
  &amp;&amp; ($valid_a is falsy || &lt;extra stuff&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>From the <code>if</code> condition Psalm derives the formula <code>($valid_a is !falsy)</code>. Now Psalm knows that inside the <code>if</code> block this formula holds:</p>
<pre><code>($valid_a is !falsy)
  &amp;&amp; ($valid_a is falsy || $a is !falsy)
  &amp;&amp; ($valid_a is falsy || &lt;extra stuff&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>This formula can again be simplified to</p>
<pre><code>($a is !falsy) &amp;&amp; (&lt;extra stuff&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>This tells Psalm that <code>$a</code> is never <code>falsy</code> inside the <code>if</code> condition, which allows the tool to avoid a false-positive that other tools miss.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-cost">Whatâ€™s theÂ&nbsp;cost?</h2>
<p>Performing flow-sensitive conditional analysis adds a small (roughly 6%) average increase in Psalmâ€™s overall runtime. There are a number of pathological cases that can create very large formulae (Psalm maxes out at 20,000 terms before it gives up trying to simplify formulae).</p>
<p>This analysis can also generate some slightly convoluted issue messages. For instance</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
function checkValue(string $a) : void {
    if ($a !== "hello") {
        if ($a === "hello") {
            // some code
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Produces</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Condition <code>($a is string(hello))</code> contradicts a previously-established condition <code>($a is not string(hello))</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the plus-side, a slightly-convoluted message is better than no message at all.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-an-island">I am anÂ&nbsp;island</h3>
<p>Lastly there's a cost to maintaining a system that doesnâ€™t appear to exist outside of Psalm. Iâ€™m hoping this article might change that!</p>

        <p>These are the books I recommend to developers wanting to improve their
skills as professional programmers because of high information
density, believable premises/examples, and being well edited.</p>
<p>You don't need to read books to improve as a developer but
they are unparalleled in quickly helping you gain depth in a subject.</p>
<h3 id="effective-python:-90-specific-ways-to-write-better-python">Effective Python: 90 Specific Ways to Write Better Python</h3><p>If you're a Python developer wanting to improve your craft you should
read this. Good Python starts with a deep understanding of the
standard library and language.</p>
<h3 id="high-performance-browser-networking">High Performance Browser Networking</h3><p>If your code is triggered by a desktop or mobile browser you should
read this. It is a thorough high level introduction to mobile
networks, browser network protocols, and fundementals of networking.</p>
<h3 id="designing-data-intensive-applications">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</h3><p>If your databases and APIs are a bottleneck you should read this. A
solid introduction to distributed computing, data transfer, indexing,
etc.</p>
<h3 id="site-reliability-engineering:-how-google-runs-production-services">Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Services</h3><p>If you are responsible for services in production you should read
this. It's Google specific but is an excellent background on practices
for monitoring and maintaining production environments.</p>
<h3 id="that's-it!">That's it!</h3><p>Generic software books conspicuously not on this list for
me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean Code</li>
<li>JavaScript the Good Parts</li>
<li>Design Patterns/Gang of Four</li>
<li>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
<li>A Philosophy of Software Design</li>
</ul>
<p>They're not all bad but give nowhere near as much return for the
investment of your time.</p>
<h4 id="feedback">Feedback</h4><p>As always, I'd love to <a href="mailto:me@eatonphil.com">hear from you</a> with

		<p>To make it so that anyone with a web browser can code on Replit, our backend infrastructures runs on preemptible VMs. That means the computer running your code can shutdown at any time! We've made it really fast for repls to reconnect when that happens. Despite our best efforts, though, people had been seeing repls stuck connecting for a long time. After some profiling and digging into the Docker source code, we found and fixed the problem. Our session connection error rate dropped from 3% to under 0.5% and our 99th percentile session boot time dropped from 2 minutes to 15 seconds.</p>
<p>There were many different causes of stuck repls, varying from: unhealthy machines, race conditions that lead to deadlock, and slow container shutdowns. This post focuses how we fixed the last cause, slow container shutdowns. Slow container shutdowns affected nearly everyone using the platform and would cause a repl to be inaccesible for up to a minute.</p>
<h3 id="replit-architecture">Replit Architecture</h3>
<p>Before going in depth on fixing slow container shutdowns, you'll need some knowledge of Replit's architecture.</p>
<p>When you open a repl, the browser opens a websocket connection to a Docker container running on a preemptible VM. Each of the VMs run something we call <code>conman</code>, which is short for container manager.</p>
<p>We must ensure that there is only a single container per repl at anytime. The container is used to facilitate multiplayer features, so its important that every user in the repl connects to the same container.</p>
<p>When a machine that hosts these Docker containers shuts down, we have to wait for each container to be destroyed before they can be started again on some other machine. Since we use preemptible instances, this process happens frequently.</p>
<p>Below you can see the typical flow when trying to access a repl on a mid-shutdown instance.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/destroying-stuck-repls/simplified_arch.png" alt="Simplified diagram of repl.it conman architecture"></p>
<ol>
<li>A user opens their repl which opens the IDE and attempts to connect to the backend evaluation server via a WebSocket.</li>
<li>The request hits a load balancer which selects a conman instance to proxy to based on CPU usage.</li>
<li>A healthy, living conman gets the request. Conman notices that the request is for a container that is living on a different conman and proxies the request there.</li>
<li>Sadly this conman is shutting down and rejects the WebSocket connection!</li>
</ol>
<p>Requests will continue to fail until either:</p>
<ol>
<li>The docker container is shut down and the repl container entry in the global store is removed.</li>
<li>Conman finishes shutting down and is no longer accessible. In this case, the first conman will remove the old repl container entry and start a new container.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="slow-container-shutdowns">Slow Container Shutdowns</h3>
<p>Our preemptible VMs are given 30 seconds to cleanly shutdown before they are forcibly terminated. After some investigation, we found that we rarely finished shutting down within those 30 seconds. This prompted us to dig further and instrument the machine shutdown routine.</p>
<p>After adding some more logging and metrics around machine shutdowns, it became clear that calls to <code>docker kill</code> were taking much longer than expected. <code>docker kill</code> usually took a few milliseconds to kill a repl container during normal operation, but we spent 20+ seconds killing 100-200 containers at the same time during shutdown.</p>
<p>Docker offers two ways to stop a container: <code>docker stop</code> and <code>docker kill</code>. Docker stop sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to the container and gives it a grace period to gracefully shutdown. If the container doesn't shutdown within the grace period, the container is sent <code>SIGKILL</code>. We don't care about gracefully shutting down the container and would rather shut it down as quickly as possible. <code>docker kill</code> sends <code>SIGKILL</code> which should kill the container immediately. For some reason, the theory did not match reality, <code>docker kill</code> shouldn't be taking on the order of seconds to <code>SIGKILL</code> the container. There must be something else going on.</p>
<p>To dig into this, here is a script which will create 200 docker containers and time how long it takes to kill them at the same time.</p>
<pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash
</span>
COUNT=200
<span>echo</span> <span>"Starting <span>$COUNT</span> containers..."</span>
<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> $(seq 1 <span>$COUNT</span>); <span>do</span>
    <span>printf</span> .
    docker run -d --name <span>test</span>-<span>$i</span> nginx &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
<span>done</span>

<span>echo</span> -e <span>"\nKilling <span>$COUNT</span> containers..."</span>
time $(docker <span>kill</span> $(docker container ls -a --filter <span>"name=test"</span> --format <span>"{{.ID}}"</span>) &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1)

<span>echo</span> -e <span>"\nCleaning up..."</span>
docker rm $(docker container ls -a --filter <span>"name=test"</span> --format <span>"{{.ID}}"</span>) &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
<p>Running this on the same kind of VM we run in production, a GCE n1-highmem-4 instance, yields:</p>
<pre><code>Starting 200 containers...
................................&lt;trimmed&gt;
Killing 200 containers...

real    0m37.732s
user    0m0.135s
sys     0m0.081s

Cleaning up...</code></pre><p>This confirmed our suspicions that something is going in inside the Docker runtime which causes shutdowns to be so slow. Time to dig into Docker itself...</p>
<p>Docker daemon has an option to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/#enable-debugging">enable debug logging</a>. These logs let us peak into what what's happening inside of dockerd and each entry has a timestamp so it might provide some insight into where all this time is being spent.</p>
<p>With debug logging enabled, let's rerun the script and look at dockerd's logs. This will output a lot of log messages since we are dealing with 200 container, so I've hand-selected portions of the logs that are of interest.</p>

<p>At this point in my adventure, I decided it was time to start digging into docker engine's source code and build my own version of dockerd with some extra logging.</p>
<p>I started out by looking for the codepath that handles container kill requests. I added some extra log messages with timings of different spans and eventually I found out where all this time was being spent:</p>
<p><code>SIGKILL</code> is sent to the container and then before responding to the HTTP request, the engine waits for the container to no longer be running (<a href="https://github.com/docker/engine/blob/ab373df1125b6002603456fd7f554ef370389ad9/daemon/kill.go#L174">source</a>)</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;-container.Wait(context.Background(), containerpkg.WaitConditionNotRunning)</code></pre><p>The <code>container.Wait</code> function returns a channel which receives the exit code and any error from the container. Unfortunately, to get the exit code and error, a lock on the interal container struct must be acquired.

			<div><span size="+2">Silence is a Commons by Ivan Illich</span><p>
						
						Computers are doing to communication<br>
						what fences did to pastures<br>
						and cars did to streets.</p><p>
						
						by Ivan Illich</p><p>
						
						
						
						
						Minna-san, gladly I accept the honour of addressing this forum on Science and Man. The theme that Mr. Tsuru proposes, "The Computer-Managed Society," sounds an alarm. Clearly you foresee that machines which ape people are tending to encroach on every aspect of people's lives, and that such machines force people to behave like machines. The new electronic devices do indeed have the power to force people to "communicate" with them and with each other on the terms of the machine. Whatever structurally does not fit the logic of machines is effectively filtered from a culture dominated by their use.</p><p>
						
						The machine-like behaviour of people chained to electronics constitutes a degradation of their well-being and of their dignity which, for most people in the long run, becomes intolerable. Observations of the sickening effect of programmed environments show that people in them become indolent, impotent, narcissistic and apolitical. The political process breaks down, because people cease to be able to govern themselves; they demand to be managed.</p><p>
						
						I congratulate Asahi Shimbun on its efforts to foster a new democratic consensus in Japan, by which your more than seven million readers become aware of the need to limit the encroachment of machines on the style of their own behaviour. It is important that precisely Japan initiate such action. Japan is looked upon as the capital of electronics; it would be marvellous if it became for the entire world the model of a new politics of self-limitation in the field of communication, which, in my opinion, is henceforth necessary if a people wants to remain self-governing.</p><p>
						
						Electronic management as a political issue can be approached in several ways. I propose, at the beginning of this public consultation, to approach the issue as one of political ecology. Ecology, during the last ten years, has acquired a new meaning. It is still the name for a branch of professional biology, but the term now increasingly serves as the label under which a broad, politically organized general public analyzes and influences technical decisions. I want to focus on the new electronic management devices as a technical change of the human environment which, to be benign, must remain under political (and not exclusively expert) control. I have chosen this focus for my introduction, because I thus continue my conversation with those three Japanese colleagues to whom I owe what I know about your country - Professors Yoshikazu Sakamoto, Joshiro Tamanoi and Jun Ui.</p><p>
						
						In the 13 minutes still left to me on this rostrum I will clarify a distinction that I consider fundamental to political ecology. I shall distinguish the environment as commons from the environment as resource. On our ability to make this particular distinction depends not only the construction of a sound theoretical ecology, but also - and more importantly - effective ecological jurisprudence Minna-san, how I wish, at this point, that I were a pupil trained by your Zen poet, the great Basho. Then perhaps in a bare 17 syllables I could express the distinction between the commons within which people's subsistence activities are embedded, and resources that serve for the economic production of those commodities on which modem survival depends. If I were a poet, perhaps I would make this distinction so beautifully and incisively that it would penetrate your hearts and remain unforgettable. Unfortunately I am not a Japanese poet. I must speak to you in English, a language that during the last 100 years has lost the ability to make this distinction, and - in addition - I must speak through translation. Only because I may count on the translating genius of Mr. Muramatsu do I dare to recover Old English meanings with a talk in Japan.</p><p>
						
						"Commons" is an Old English word. According to my Japanese friends, it is quite close to the meaning that iriai still has in Japanese "Commons," like iriai, is a word which, in preindustrial times, was used to designate certain aspects of the environment. People called commons those parts of the environment for which customary law exacted specific forms of community respect. People called commons that part of the environment which lay beyond their own thresholds and outside of their own possessions, to which, however, they had recognized claims of usage, not to produce commodities but to provide for the subsistence of their households. The customary law which humanized the environment by establishing the commons was usually unwritten. It was unwritten law not only because people did not care to write it down, but because what it protected was a reality much too complex to fit into paragraphs. The law of the commons regulates the right of way, the right to fish and to hunt, to graze, and to collect wood or medicinal plants in the forest.</p><p>
						
						An oak tree might be in the commons. Its shade, in summer, is reserved for the shepherd and his flock; its acorns are reserved for the pigs of the neighbouring peasants; its dry branches serve as fuel for the widows of the village; some of its fresh twigs in springtime are cut as ornaments for the church - and at sunset it might be the place for the village assembly. When people spoke about commons, iriai, they designated an aspect of the environment that was limited, that was necessary for the community's survival, that was necessary for different groups in different ways, but which, in a strictly economic sense, was not perceived as scarce.</p><p>
						
						When today, in Europe, with university students I use the term "commons" (in German Almende or Gemeinheit, in Italian gli usi civici) my listeners immediately think of the eighteenth century. They think of those pastures in England on which villagers each kept a few sheep, and they think of the "enclosure of the pastures" which transformed the grassland from commons into a resource on which commercial flocks could be raised. Primarily, however, my students think of the innovation of poverty which came with enclosure: of the absolute impoverishment of the peasants, who were driven from the land and into wage labour, and they think of the commercial enrichment of the lords.</p><p>
						
						In their immediate reaction, my students think of the rise of a new capitalist order. Facing that painful newness, they forget that enclosure also stands for something more basic. The enclosure of the commons inaugurates a new ecological order: Enclosure did not just physically transfer the control over grasslands from the peasants to the lord. Enclosure marked a radical change in the attitudes of society towards the environment. Before, in any juridical system, most of the environment had been considered as commons from which most people could draw most of their sustenance without needing to take recourse to the market. After enclosure, the environment became primarily a resource at the service of "enterprises" which, by organizing wage-labor, transformed nature into the goods and services on which the satisfaction of basic needs by consumers depends. This transformation is in the blind spot of political economy.</p><p>
						
						This change of attitudes can be illustrated better if we think about roads rather than about grasslands. What a difference there was between the new and the old parts of Mexico City only 20 years ago. In the old parts of the city the streets were true commons. Some people sat on the road to sell vegetables and charcoal. Others put their chairs on the road to drink coffee or tequila. Others held their meetings on the road to decide on the new headman for the neighbourhood or to determine the price of a donkey. Others drove their donkeys through the crowd, walking next to the heavily loaded beast of burden; others sat in the saddle. Children played in the gutter, and still people walking could use the road to get from one place to another.</p><p>
						
						Such roads were not built for people. Like any true commons, the street itself was the result of people living there and making that space liveable. The dwellings that lined the roads were not private homes in the modern sense - garages for the overnight deposit of workers. The threshold still separated two living spaces, one intimate and one common. But neither homes in this intimate sense nor streets as commons survived economic development.</p><p>
						
						In the new sections of Mexico City, streets are no more for people. They are now roadways for automobiles, for buses, for taxis, cars, and trucks. People are barely tolerated on the streets unless they are on their way to a bus stop. If people now sat down or stopped on the street, they would become obstacles for traffic, and traffic would be dangerous to them. The road has been degraded from a commons to a simple resource for the circulation of vehicles. People can circulate no more on their own. Traffic has displaced their mobility. They can circulate only when they are strapped down and are moved. </p><p>
						
						The appropriation of the grassland by the lords was challenged, but the more fundamental transformation of grassland (or of roads) from commons to resource has happened, until recently, without being subjected to criticism. The appropriation of the environment by the few was clearly recognized as an intolerable abuse By contrast, the even more degrading transformation of people into members of an industrial labour force and into consumers was taken, until recently, for granted. For almost a hundred years the majority of political parties has challenged the accumulation of environmental resources in private hands. However, the issue was argued in terms of the private utilization of these resources, not the distinction of commons. Thus …</p></div></div></div>

February 2, 2021 | https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-htmx-with-aspnet-core | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/using-htmx-with-aspnet-core">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>PS:</strong> If you need assistance on any of your ASP.NET Core projects, I am <!-- --> <a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/hire/">available for hire</a> <!-- --> for freelance work.</p><div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few years ago I wrote a series of blog posts around the theme of <a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/you-might-not-need-angular-introduction/">“You might not need Angular”</a>. The premise of that series was that we want to add tiny bits of interactivity to web pages in many situations without having to resort to a client-side framework such as Angular.</p>
<p>In that post, I mentioned that Blazor (<em>which at that stage was at version 0.5.0</em>) could improve things in the future. Blazor has since been released, and in many cases, it is a viable alternative to SPA frameworks. However, for me, it is still not feasible in many situations. Blazor Server suffers from latency and scalability issues, and Blazor WebAssembly has a big download size.</p>

<p>I believe there is still a middle ground where you may be happy with using Razor Pages or MVC, but want to add <em>sprinkles</em> of interactivity to some of your pages to give a better user experience.</p>
<p>In this new series, I will introduce you to <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>, a library that allows you to do this. It works in a very similar fashion to the now-deprecated <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive">jQuery Unobtrusive Ajax library</a> which I used in the first series. I will also work through a few common scenarios and demonstrate how you can implement it with Razor Pages and HTMX.</p>
<p>This series consists of the following blog posts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction (this blog post)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/htmx-deleting-items/">Deleting items from a list</a></li>
<li>Do a full page refresh when deleting items (coming 9 February)</li>
<li>Inline editing (coming 16 February)</li>
<li>Infinite scrolling (coming 23 February)</li>
<li>Real-time search (coming 2 March)</li>
</ol>
<h2>The HTMX library</h2>
<p>HTMX is a library that allows you to add features such as AJAX and DOM updates to your web pages. Instead of requiring you to write JavaScript, HTMX enables you to add this functionality by adding some attributes to your HTML markup.</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of this model, let’s look at the following example from the HTMX website:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>hx-post</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/clicked<span>"</span></span> <span>hx-swap</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>outerHTML<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    Click Me
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can see that we have a <code>button</code> element with two additional <code>hx-*</code> attributes defined.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>hx-post</code> attribute tells HTMX that when a user clicks on the button, it should perform an HTTP POST request to <code>/clicked</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>hx-swap</code> attribute tells HTMX that it should replace the <code>button</code> element with the content from this request’s response.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will cover HTMX in more detail in the remaining blog posts in this series, but you can also refer to the <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/">HTMX documentation</a> if you want a better understanding of it.</p>
<h2>Installing HTMX in an ASP.NET Core application</h2>
<p>The quickest way to add HTMX to your ASP.NET Core application is to reference the script via <a href="https://unpkg.com/">UNPKG</a>. To do that, add the following script to the Razor Pages where you want to use it:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.1.0<span>"</span></span> <span>integrity</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>sha384-JVb/MVb+DiMDoxpTmoXWmMYSpQD2Z/1yiruL8+vC6Ri9lk6ORGiQqKSqfmCBbpbX<span>"</span></span> <span>crossorigin</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>anonymous<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The script above uses version 1.1.0, but you can refer to the <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/#installing">installation section</a> on the HTMX website for the latest version and installation instructions.</p>
<p>If you prefer to make use of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/?view=aspnetcore-5.0">LibMan</a>, you can run the following command:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>libman <span>install</span> htmx.org@1.1.0 --provider unpkg --files dist/htmx.min.js</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, proceed to add the reference to the HTMX file as follows:</p>
<div data-language="html"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>~/lib/htmx.org/dist/htmx.min.js<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this blog post, I gave you a brief introduction to this series and HTMX and demonstrated how you could add the HTMX library to your existing ASP.NET Core application. In the <a href="https://www.jerriepelser.com/blog/htmx-deleting-items">next blog post</a>, I will show you how to use HTMX to delete items from a list.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On August 22, 1994 (over 25 years ago) Jeff Bezos posted the first Amazon job offer to Usenet seeking a very talented developer to help launch the site. While Bezos hadn’t named it Amazon yet, the job posting on Usenet clearly shows that he needs a coder with lots of talent. In return he promises “meaningful equity ownership”. We can only imagine what that would be worth in Amazon stock today. Shel Kaphan, Amazon’s first CTO was hired shortly after the newsgroup post. It’s not clear whether or not he responded to the post but it’s very cool to see the history represented on Usenet.&nbsp; Here’s a look at the post.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://1t21h7uca2ehzzcj298yrla12.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/amazon-job-post.png" alt="Amazon's first job post" width="580" height="504" srcset="http://1t21h7uca2ehzzcj298yrla12.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/amazon-job-post.png 580w, http://1t21h7uca2ehzzcj298yrla12.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/amazon-job-post-300x261.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></p>
<p>The post reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well-capitalized start-up seeks extremely talented C/C++/Unix developers to help pioneer commerce on the Internet. You must have experience designing and building large and complex (yet maintainable) systems, and you should be able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible. You should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or the equivalent. Top-notch communication skills are essential. Familiarity with web servers and HTML would be helpful but is not necessary.</p>
<p>Expect talented, motivated, intense, and interesting co-workers. Must be willing to relocate to the Seattle area (we will help cover moving costs).</p>
<p>Your compensation will include meaningful equity ownership.</p>
<p>Send resume and cover letter to Jeff Bezos:</p>
<p>mail: be…@netcom.com<br>
fax: 206/828-0951<br>
US mail: Cadabra, Inc.<br>
10704 N.E. 28th St.<br>
Bellevue, WA 98004</p>
<p>We are an equal opportunity employer.</p>

<p>First job posting to world domination in 25 years, all from a single Usenet post 🙂</p>

			<h2>Confidence</h2>

			<div>

	
				<p>Confidence is a rare commodity.&nbsp;It&nbsp;grows organically after <em>positive reinforcement</em>. Without positive reinforcement, there can be no confidence.</p>
<p>People who&nbsp;say otherwise,&nbsp;generally conflict fake confidence&nbsp;for the real thing. Fake confidence can backfire as&nbsp;a wise person&nbsp;can see right through your bullshit.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can do things that lead to positive reinforcement, on&nbsp;whatever subject you’re insecure about. A world-class kickboxer might feel confident in the ring,&nbsp;yet nervous when filing his taxes.&nbsp;His accountant might feel anxious talking to hot girls. And a womanizer might feel retarded trying to learn web development.</p>
<p>As long as you’re willing to adopt a&nbsp;<em>beginner’s mindset</em>&nbsp;and keep learning and iterating, you&nbsp;will become better at whatever you’re doing. And once you experience enough positive reinforcement, your confidence will grow naturally.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>React was introduced in May 2013. Its paradigm shift was that <strong>your UI was a function of your state</strong>. Given some component state, React can determine what your component will look like. React is <em>built</em> upon the idea of state. However, state has long been one of the most difficult parts of building a React application.</p><p>Let's imagine state management in React as a rugged tool belt. You've used this tool belt for years, slowly adding new tools as needed. Each tool serves a very specific purpose. You don't use your hammer to screw in bolts. As a craftsman, you've learned the right time and place to use each tool.</p><p><strong>State management with React is a rugged tool belt, but not everyone has the prior experience to know which tool to reach for.</strong> This post will explain the past, present, and future of state management to help you make the correct decision for your team, project, or organization.</p><h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2><p>Before we begin, it's critical you understand some of the terms commonly used. These aren't the canonical names. A few different variations of each float around, but the underlying ideas are the same:</p><ul><li>UI State â€“ State used for controlling interactive parts of our application (e.g. dark mode toggle, modals).</li><li>Server Cache State â€“ State from the server, which we cache on the client-side for quick access (e.g. call an API, store the result, use it in multiple places).</li><li>Form State â€“ The many different states of a form (e.g. loading, submitting, disabled, validation, retrying). There's also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html">controlled &amp; uncontrolled form state</a>.</li><li>URL State â€“ State managed by the browser (e.g. filter products, saving to query parameters, and refreshing the page to see the same products filtered)</li><li>State Machine â€“ An explicit model of your state over time (e.g. a stoplight goes from green â†’ yellow â†’ red, but never green â†’ red).</li></ul><h2 id="past">Past</h2><p>React's component model helped create reusable, composable applications. Each component had its own local state. As web apps became more complex, new solutions emerged to more easily share logic between components.</p><h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3><p>To help you understand how state management has evolved over time, here's a rough timeline of popular state management solutions in React. This list is heavily focused on UI State. This list is not comprehensive, but is enough to give context.</p><ul><li>2013 â€“ Introduction</li><li>2014 â€“ Flux (many libraries)</li><li>2015 â€“ Redux</li><li>2016 â€“ MobX</li><li>2018 â€“ Context</li><li>2019 â€“ Hooks Introduced (+ React Query, SWR)</li><li>2019 â€“ Zustand</li><li>2019 â€“ xState</li><li>2020 â€“ Jotai, Recoil, Valtio</li><li>2021 â€“ useSelectedContext</li></ul><p>Just because an item is listed on this timeline does not know you need to learn it. More on this later. Let's dive into the history of state management in React.</p><h3 id="redux">Redux</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux</a> was originally created as an implementation of the "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/#redux-was-built-as-a-flux-architecture-implementation">Flux Architecture</a>", which was a pattern first suggested by Facebook in 2014. Redux came out in 2015 and quickly became the most popular of many Flux-inspired libraries. It's ecosystem of tools and libraries encapsulated both UI state and server caching state. <strong>Redux is still extremely popular and widely used.</strong></p><div><p><img alt="Redux Growth" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="server-caching-state">Server Caching State</h3><p>In the early days of React, lots of state management boiled down to fetching data from APIs and caching it for use across the application. The community leaned heavily on libraries like Redux because there wasn't an easy, widely used way to manage <em>just</em> the server cache state.</p><p>With the release of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/02/06/react-v16.8.0.html">React Hooks</a>, encapsulating logic into shared hooks became much easier and accessible. Libraries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://swr.vercel.app/">SWR</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/">React Query</a> emerged to solve this problem specifically.</p><p>You might think "Why have a separate library just for server caching state?". Well, <strong>caching is hard</strong>. Server caching state solves different problems than UI state. Here's a shortlist of some of the things these libraries handle for you:</p><ul><li>Polling on interval</li><li>Revalidation on focus</li><li>Revalidation on network recovery</li><li>Local mutation (Optimistic UI)</li><li>Smart error retrying</li><li>Pagination and scroll position recovery</li></ul><p>Do you want to implement those yourself? <em>Probably not.</em></p><h3 id="react-context">React Context</h3><p>With <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html">v16.3</a>, React Context gave us a first-party solution to share logic between components. This also prevented passing values down as props through multiple levels of nested components (i.e. "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling">prop-drilling</a>").</p><p>React Context itself is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/">not state management</a>. It can, however, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react">be paired with hooks</a> like <code>useReducer</code> to become a state management solution. This combination solved UI state for many common use cases.</p><div><p><img alt="React Context" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h2 id="present">Present</h2><p>In 2021, there are various ways to handle state management in React. As the community has grown to understand the different types of state, more granular libraries have been created solving very specific use cases.</p><h3 id="state-machines">State Machines</h3><p>Let's consider a switch statement. If the value of <code>state</code> matches any <code>case</code>, the corresponding code runs. There's a finite set of cases. This is the most simple state machine â€“ an explicit model of your state.</p><pre><code><span>switch</span> <span>(</span>state<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>case</span> state <span>===</span> <span>'loading'</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>case</span> state <span>===</span> <span>'success'</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>break</span><span>;</span>
  <span>default</span><span>:</span>
  
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#finite-state-machines">Finite State Machines</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/about/concepts.html#statecharts">Statecharts</a> are fundamental Computer Science concepts, so this isn't anything React specific. You can turn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer"><code>useReducer</code></a> into a state machine without any third-party libraries.</p><p>State Machines are well-adopted everywhere, including databases, electronics, cars, and more. As state management evolved in the React ecosystem, we realized these old ideas could solve modern state management issues. State Machines are most prevalent for solving form state.</p><p>With a Finite State Machine, you have a finite number of states your application or component could be in. In practice, State Machines help you uncover bugs as you're required to think through and define edge cases. For much more information on this, I'd recommend checking out the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/docs/">xState</a> docs or watching <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-state-machines-using-xstate">this course</a>. You can also <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://xstate.js.org/viz/">visualize entire state machines online</a>.</p><div><p><img alt="State Machines" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="zustand-recoil-jotai-valtio-oh-my">Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, Valtio, Oh My!</h3><p>Why do so many different libraries for React state management even exist?</p><p>Let's consider Figma (or any other design tool). You have a toolbar of controls that affect other elements outside of its "local" state, or where the component is rendered.</p><div><p><img alt="Figma" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>As you can imagine, an application of this scale would require a complex state management solution. Performance and frame rate are critical for a good user experience here, so you want control over when &amp; how to re-render. Unique use cases like this have led to lots of exploration in the state management space.</p><p>To summarize the differences between these libraries, let's hear from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1348257768130560008">Daishi Kato</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Valtio</strong> uses proxies to provide a mutation-style API</li><li><strong>Jotai</strong> is optimized for "computed values" and async actions</li><li><strong>Zustand</strong> is a very thin library specifically focused on module state</li><li><strong>Recoil</strong> is an experimental library using a data-flow graph</li></ul><p>Having complex state doesn't necessarily mean you <em>have</em> to pull for a third-party library. You can start with React and JavaScript and see how far it takes you. If optimizing requires a state management library, you can track that metric (e.g. frame rate), measure it, and verify it solves a real problem.</p><p><strong>Don't choose one of these libraries unless there's an obvious need.</strong></p><h3 id="immutable-state">Immutable State</h3><p>Another debate is mutable vs. immutable state. There's no right answers, just opinions. If you were doing state management with vanilla JavaScript, you'll likely have mutable state. You initialize a variable, and then later set it equal to some new value. There are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">entire debates</a> on <code>let</code> vs. <code>const</code>.</p><p>Immutable state gained a lot of popularity with React. The immutable crowd argues that allowing your state management solution of choice to mutate state directly results in more bugs. The mutable crowd argues it's not worth the complexity trade-off. Direct manipulation will always be less safe than indirect manipulation. It's a tradeoff between convenience and risk, which is up to you and your team.</p><p>Solutions like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://overreacted.io/on-let-vs-const/">Immer</a> allow you to write mutable code but <em>execute</em> it immutably. Fancy. The basic idea is you apply your changes to a <em>draft state</em>, which is a proxy of the <em>current state</em>. Once the mutations have completed Immer will produce the <em>next state</em> based on the changes to the draft state.</p><div><p><img alt="Immer Immutable State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="url-state">URL State</h3><p>Let's say you're building an e-commerce website like Amazon. You search for React books and filter by 4+ stars. This state is persisted as query parameters and managed by the browser. When you refresh the page, you see the same list of products. You can share this URL with others and they also see the same results.</p><div><p><img alt="Amazon URL State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Another interesting example of this is Nomad List. We can transform the browser URL state into a function of our data. Plus, we can make human-readable URLs (which Google prefers).</p><div><p><img alt="Nomad List URL State" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><h3 id="future">Future</h3><p>For large applications, it's possible a naive Context-based state management solutions (e.g. with <code>useReducer</code>) could have issues with excessive re-rendering. When a context value changes, all components that <code>useContext</code> will re-render. This makes UI interactions feel slow and janky. If you can't visually notice it, you can <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://brycedooley.com/debug-react-rerenders/">use React Dev Tools</a> to investigate re-rendering.</p><p>The React team has proposed a <code>useSelectedContext</code> hook to prevent performance issues with Context at scale. This <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119">RFC was introduced</a> in July 2019 and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20646">progress has started</a> as of January 2021 behind a feature flag. This hook allows you to select a "slice" of Context and only re-render when that piece changes.</p><p>There are ways to work around re-rendering performance already (e.g. <code>useMemo</code>) but a first-party solution for Context is preferred. There's also a community library <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.notion.so/Past-Present-and-Future-of-React-State-Management-493ffbc810ed41f8bc66e37c86db4af1">useContextSelector</a>, which takes a similar approach (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/usecontextselector-demo-sixdr?file=/src/App.js">demo</a>). <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai">Jotai</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://formik.org/blog/formik-3-alpha">Formik 3</a> use this under the hood. Having <code>useSelectedContext</code> as part of the React standard library will eliminate complexity and code size in external libraries, as well as provide more performant options by default.</p><p>In the longer-term future, React will automatically figure out which components to re-render ("<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119#issuecomment-586390430">auto-memoization</a>").</p><h2 id="state-management-options">State Management Options</h2><p>This is not a comprehensive list.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Regularly, I discover myself thinking <em>"wow, that's so simple I can build this in a weekend"</em>. My rational brain kicks in at some point: <em>"Waaaaiiit a second, if it's so simple, why am I not seeing this done a million times?"</em>. Here I usually start better scoping and either find the answer to my question.</p><p>Often, my developer mind insists on "it's actually just two API endpoints and then I could do this and that". And often this holds true for the core functionality. If some <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/">basic validation</a> gives a green light for working on it from a commercial perspective, I still need to consider the tech stack and marketing approach, as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/why-build-it-and-they-will-come-wont-work-anymore">building alone doesn't do it</a>.</p><p>I'm not super fixed on the approach, my main goal is usually to keep long term overhead low. Laravel is my go-to solution for anything backend-heavy, but its power comes at a complexity cost too. For two little API endpoints used in, for example, a browser extension is a bit of an overkill.</p><p>Function as a service sounds like a great step towards "just having a few API endpoints". AWS Lambda is the name everyone is having in mind here. But any gains from simplicity are eaten up by AWS complexity. If you are new to AWS (Lambda), it easily takes you double or more time to get it running as you spend building the little lean function in the first place. This doesn't go well with the plan to "just chuck this out over the weekend".</p><h2 id="enter%3A-faasd">Enter: faasd <a href="#enter%3A-faasd">#</a></h2><p>Function as a Service should be easy. Here comes <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introducing-faasd/">faasd</a> into play. It's a self-hosted alternative to run functions. It allows you to run a simple copy &amp; paste installer script on your machine getting it up and running. It takes less than ten minutes to get to work. It's production-ready and helps to remove the learning curve involved with Kubernetes and co.</p><blockquote><p>faasd is a self-hosted alternative to AWS Lambda to run functions. Production-ready within minutes ⏲️</p></blockquote><p>Once you have deployed your faasd instance, it's a matter of one command to push your function into production. From there it's up to you what you like to build. I catch myself breaking up the structure of larger applications in functions. It builds the container, publishes, and deploys your function code ready-to-use in seconds. To run this you will need the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">FaaS CLI</a>. Again this is installed in under one minute thanks to copy and paste that just works.</p><p>Found a great library but it's written in the "wrong" language? Thanks to the flexibility, you can also jump between programming languages easily. I use a mix of nodejs, PHP, and Python by now.</p><blockquote><p>With functions you libraries aren't in the <em>wrong</em> language anymore.</p></blockquote><p>This helps to truly break up large applications into functional parts using the best tool for you. You can get a rich list of the official templates by running:</p><pre><code>$ faas-cli template store list<p>NAME                     SOURCE             DESCRIPTION<br>csharp                   openfaas           Classic C<br>dockerfile               openfaas           Classic Dockerfile template<br>go                       openfaas           Classic Golang template<br>java8                    openfaas           Java <span>8</span> template<br>java11                   openfaas           Java <span>11</span> template<br>java11-vert-x            openfaas           Java <span>11</span> Vert.x template<br>node12                   openfaas           HTTP-based Node <span>12</span> template<br>node                     openfaas           Classic NodeJS <span>8</span> template<br>php7                     openfaas           Classic PHP <span>7</span> template<br>python                   openfaas           Classic Python <span>2.7</span> template<br>python3                  openfaas           Classic Python <span>3.6</span> template<br>python3-dlrs             intel              Deep Learning Reference Stack v0.4 <span>for</span> ML workloads<br>ruby                     openfaas           Classic Ruby <span>2.5</span> template<br>ruby-http                openfaas           Ruby <span>2.4</span> HTTP template<br>python27-flask           openfaas           Python <span>2.7</span> Flask template<br>python3-flask            openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> Flask template<br>python3-flask-debian     openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> Flask template based on Debian<br>python3-http             openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> with Flask and HTTP<br>python3-http-debian      openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> with Flask and HTTP based on Debian<br>golang-http              openfaas           Golang HTTP template<br>golang-middleware        openfaas           Golang Middleware template<br>python3-debian           openfaas           Python <span>3</span> Debian template<br>powershell-template      openfaas-incubator Powershell Core Ubuntu:16.04 template<br>powershell-http-template openfaas-incubator Powershell Core HTTP Ubuntu:16.04 template<br>rust                     booyaa             Rust template<br>crystal                  tpei               Crystal template<br>csharp-httprequest       distantcam         C<br>csharp-kestrel           burtonr            C<br>vertx-native             pmlopes            Eclipse Vert.x native image template<br>swift                    affix              Swift <span>4.2</span> Template<br>lua53                    affix              Lua <span>5.3</span> Template<br>vala                     affix              Vala Template<br>vala-http                affix              Non-Forking Vala Template<br>quarkus-native           pmlopes            Quarkus.io native image template<br>perl-alpine              tmiklas            Perl language template based on Alpine image<br>crystal-http             koffeinfrei        Crystal HTTP template<br>rust-http                openfaas-incubator Rust HTTP template<br>bash-streaming           openfaas-incubator Bash Streaming template<br>cobol                    devries            COBOL Template</p></code></pre><p>There are also inofficial templates you can find with a bit of research on GitHub.</p><p>Start with a new function by running:</p><pre><code>faas-cli new function-name --lang node12</code></pre><p>This creates a function based on the node12 template.

So I started by building a simple <a href="https://github.com/spekulatius/faasd-franc">function to detect the language</a> of a given string.

Don't like how it's going? Drop it, delete the function and your system is clean once more. No compilers, dependencies, and other tooling remain on your system.</p><h2 id="lessons-learned-along-the-way">Lessons learned along the way <a href="#lessons-learned-along-the-way">#</a></h2><p>At the beginning, I didn't want to run my own container registry. I expected additional overhead and "another thing to maintain". This turned out to be a mistake, as the setup was almost as easy as faasd itself. Plus, the performance is much better than relying on Docker Hub.</p><p>I got it up and running on my <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/hetzner">Hetzner server</a> in a few minutes using some guides from <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/digitalocean">DigitalOcean</a>.</p><p>After spinning up your server, the steps break down to:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">installing docker</a>,</li><li>setting up the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-private-docker-registry-on-ubuntu-18-04">container registry</a>, and</li><li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04">securing nginx</a>.</li></ul><p>Another really interesting option is <a href="https://get-arkade.dev/">arkade</a>. It allows you to abstract the steps.</p><p>I should have also paid closer attention to the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/workshop/">OpenFaaS workshop</a> at the beginning. It guides you through the basics with examples better than purely self-discovery does. This is especially true for me, as I'm not deep in the serverless space.</p><h2 id="worry-about-scaling%2C-when-you-get-to-scale">Worry about scaling, when you get to scale <a href="#worry-about-scaling%2C-when-you-get-to-scale">#</a></h2><p>As with any solution approach, there are limitations. For the most time, I leave these concerns out. It simply doesn't matter if my functions can scale to millions of users, as I don't have millions of users. Migrating to a more scalable approach such as <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud">OpenFaaS Cloud</a> should be very doable.</p><blockquote><p>Worry about scaling, when you get to scale. Until then build and market.</p></blockquote><p>We can probably agree: The people behind a project matter to its success for a large part. The OpenFaaS project is driven by <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/">Alex Ellis</a>, a passionate developer. He and the contributors maintain an active slack channel - questions from newbie-level to expert find answers there. Alex is supporting this effort with contracting, but other options such as sponsorship of <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">OpenFaaS</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis">Alex</a> directly are available (and recommended).</p><h2 id="get-playing">Get Playing <a href="#get-playing">#</a></h2><p>As with any reading: It can only take you so far. Make sure to put a few hours aside and check out faasd! It does come with a little overhead to learn and keep up. Especially for independent developers eyeing to monetize an API or build a small SaaS this could be a great solution.</p><ul><li>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>!

      <section>
        <!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>This is a story that long-time readers of Commonplace would know.</p><p>In 2010, IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity — basically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA">ARPA</a>, but for the intelligence community) — started a research initiative called the Aggregate Contingent Estimation Program. ACE was a competition to determine the best ways to ‘elicit, weight, and combine the judgment of many intelligence analysts’, and it was motivated by IARPA’s desire to know how much money, exactly, they were wasting on geopolitical analysis. In the beginning, it consisted of five competing research programs. Within two years, only one survived: this was Phillip Tetlock, Barbara Mellers and Don Moore’s Good Judgment Project.</p><p>The GJP was a forecasting tournament. It asked individual participants questions like “What are the odds that Greece would leave the Eurozone by the end of 2011?” and “What are the odds that Tesla declares bankruptcy by the end of 2021?” — questions asked months in advance of the event dates. To these prompts, you would respond with a probability estimation — 0.9 meant you were pretty damned sure Greece would leave, while 0.5 meant you were on the fence; 0.1 meant you were sure Greece would stay put. Individual forecasters were evaluated according to something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier score</a>: this rewarded you handsomely the more confident you were (you got a huge bump if you said 0.9 and Greece <em>did</em> leave the Eurozone) but also a huge punishment if you were confident and the result you were betting on didn’t happen (e.g. you said 0.9 and Greece didn’t leave). The researchers quickly discovered that a small group of participants were very good at predicting the future — they called these people ‘superforecasters’ — and then spent quite a bit of time studying what these individuals did differently from the rest.</p><p>Over time, the program runners began to realise that the GJP was a <em>fantastic</em> test bed for all sorts of interesting judgment and decision making questions. For instance, one question you could reasonably ask is: “Are there ways to improve forecasting performance for the average forecaster?”, followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman">Daniel Kahneman’s</a>: “Do superforecasters have less cognitive biases than normal forecasters? And if they do (and it turned out they <em>did</em> show less cognitive bias!) — are these people different because they did things differently, or are they different because they are different types of people?” (answer: yes, a bit of both) and the logical next question: ‘Are there ways to reduce cognitive biases amongst forecasters?’</p><p>To <em>that</em> question, the researchers discovered three interventions that worked:</p><ul><li>Training — At the beginning of the tournament, the researchers provided forecasters with a short presentation about best practices: they taught people how to think about probabilities, where to get probabilistic information, how to average professional forecasts, and then they presented participants with a list of common biases in human judgment. The goal: to reduce cognitive biases.</li><li>Teaming — Put forecasters in teams, with an online forum to discuss each prediction. The goal: to prevent biases such as group think and failures to pool information.</li><li>Tracking — Put forecasters together in teams with other forecasters of similar performance. The goal: to see if elite teams would be more accurate than regular teams.</li></ul><p>In the end, the researchers were pleased with the results of all three interventions. They wrote up a number of research papers, talking up their achievements in improving forecasting performance; Phillip Tetlock wrote a popular science book called <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting">Superforecasting</a></em> with Dan Gardner, which made a huge splash in a bunch of different domains. More recently, Tetlock and Joseph Cergniglia published a <a href="https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/45/5/125">paper in the Journal of Portfolio Management</a> about something they called the ‘Alpha-Brier Process’ — a method to accelerate learning in active investment management. And the GJP authors and their collaborators crowed about the power of training interventions to reduce cognitive bias (<a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/16/16511/jdm16511.pdf">Chang et al, 2016</a>), and marvelled at the abilities of superforecasters at picking up subtle signals (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691615577794">Mellers et al, 2015</a>).</p><p>Except that it turned out most of these interventions didn’t work by decreasing cognitive biases or increasing detection of subtle signals; they worked by tamping down on noise.</p><h2 id="the-paper">The Paper</h2><p>The reason I said long-time Commonplace readers would be familiar with this story is because I wrote a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-forecasting-series/">series about Superforecasting and the Good Judgment Project</a> at the end of 2019. If you want to save yourself some time chasing down books and papers, go and read that series — I’ve made it as comprehensive as I possibly could.</p><p>At the <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-the-superforecasters-do-it/">end of my <em>Superforecasting</em> summary</a>, I wrote:</p><blockquote>In the years since the GJP concluded, Barbara Mellers has continued to dig into the data generated by the forecasting tournaments — this time with an eye to explain why the interventions worked as well as they have.<p>The original intention of all three interventions was to reduce cognitive biases, in line with the Kahneman and Tversky research project of the time. But this didn’t turn out to be the case. In a recent interview, Mellers and INSEAD professor Ville Satopӓӓ explained that they went back and applied a statistical model to the entire 2011-2015 GJP dataset, designed to tease out the effects of bias, information and noise (BIN) respectively. Satopӓӓ writes:</p><p><em>How does the BIN model work? Simply put, it analyses the entire “signal universe” around a given question. Signals are pieces of information that the forecasters may take into account when trying to guess whether something will happen. In formulating predictions, one can rely upon either meaningful signals (i.e. information extraction) or irrelevant signals (i.e. noise). One can also organise information along erroneous lines (i.e. bias). Comparing GJP groups that experienced one or more of the three interventions to those that did not, the BIN model was able to disaggregate the respective contributions of noise, information and bias to overall improvements in prediction accuracy.</em></p><p>This explanation isn’t satisfying to me, but apart from an interview with Mellers and Satopӓӓ, there’s not much else to go on — the paper is still in progress, and hasn’t been published.</p><p>But the conclusions are intriguing. Here’s Satopӓӓ again:</p><p><em>Our experiments with the BIN model have also produced results that were more unexpected. Recall that teaming, tracking and training were deployed for the express purpose of reducing bias. Yet it seems that only teaming actually did so. Two of the three — teaming and tracking — increased information. Surprisingly, all three interventions reduced noise. In light of our current study, it appears the GJP’s forecasting improvements were overwhelmingly the result of noise reduction (emphasis added). As a rule of thumb, about 50 percent of the accuracy improvements can be attributed to noise reduction, 25 percent to tamping down bias, and 25 percent to increased information.</em></p><p>The authors have little to offer by way of actionable insight. In their interview, they suggest that using algorithms would improve noise reduction, but they also note that machines aren’t great at the multi-perspective synthesis that human superforecasters are so great at. It’s unclear to me if this is actionable. I’ll wait for the paper and report back to you once that’s out.</p></blockquote><p>That paper is titled <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3540864">Bias, Information, Noise: The BIN Model of Forecasting</a>. It was completed on the 19th of February, 2020, and was <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3540864">published to SSRN</a> in April last year — all of which I completely missed out on, because it happened right smack in the middle of the global lockdown.</p><p>The paper has two primary contributions. The first is the BIN model itself, which is a statistical model designed to tease out the respective contributions of bias, partial information, and noise to forecasting performance — at least within the context of the GJP. &nbsp;The second is what the authors use the BIN model <em>to do</em>: that is, to measure the degree their interventions improved each of the three elements. How much did tracking and teaming tamp down on cognitive bias? And how much did it help forecasters reduce noise?</p><p>The answer is exactly what Satopӓӓ reported in his original <a href="https://knowledge.insead.edu/strategy/the-secret-ingredients-of-superforecasting-12721">INSEAD piece</a>:</p><ol><li>All three interventions reduced noise. Only one intervention — teaming — reduced cognitive biases. This was <em>despite the fact that the GJP researchers targeted cognitive biases with their interventions</em> — which is a little bit like aiming for one target in an archery range and hitting a bullseye on the lane next to it. The researchers said they were taken aback by this result, and that it demanded a re-evaluation of the findings from their prior work.</li><li>Across all interventions, the rough breakdown of accuracy improvements are as follows: 50% to noise reduction, 25% to tamping down on bias, and 25% to increased information.</li></ol><p>We’ll talk about what this means in a bit; for now, I want to give you a sketch of the BIN model in action.</p><h2 id="how-the-bin-model-works">How The BIN Model Works</h2><p>The formal definition of noise is ‘unpredictable, nonsystematic error’.</p><p>Imagine that in order to make a forecast, you observe a set of signals over time. Some signals are useful, and they cause you to update your forecast. This is partial information. Other signals are irrelevant, and may cause you to update erroneously. This is noise. And some signals you misinterpret due to cognitive bias — which should lead to judgment drift in a particular direction. This is bias. The differences between noise and bias is best illustrated using the following diagram:</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-27-at-1.45.34-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-27-at-1.45.34-AM.png 600w, https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-27-at-1.45.34-AM.png 1000w, https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-01-27-at-1.45.34-AM.png 1052w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Keep this diagram in mind; it’ll come in handy in a bit.</p><p>In 2016, Daniel Kahneman co-authored a famous article in the Harvard Business Review titled <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/10/noise">Noise: How to Overcome the High, Hidden Cost of Inconsistent Decision Making</a>. The article is useful because it gives us several additional examples of noise in decision-making. Kahneman et al begin their argument with a quick comparison between bias and noise, using a …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>At Leet Resumes, we write <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">free technical resumes for experienced software engineers</a>. With experience writing thousands of resumes, I’ll jump right in with the tl;dr and then tell you why:</p><p><strong>AVOID:</strong></p><ul><li>Colors</li><li>Graphics</li><li>“Fancy” formats</li><li>Two-column formats (or three-column for that matter)</li><li>MS Word templates</li><li>LinkedIn pdf exports</li><li>Headers and footers</li></ul><p>The readers of your resumes do this for a living. It’s understandable that you’d like your resume to look unique, but it’s much more important for your readers to be able to understand your career and background, quickly and clearly.</p><p>Let me give you an analogy. When you’re using Yelp, Zillow, Apartments.com, DoorDash or Grubhub, you don’t want each listing to have a different format.  You’d like for each listing to be in the same format so that it makes it easy for you to find the information you want.  Same thing goes for engineering managers, technical recruiters, and HR staff -- they want to find the information they need on your resume easily. Please help them by avoiding these mistakes.</p><p><strong>Colors on your resume are a distraction.</strong> The large blue sidebar, the crimson top shading, the colorful curly-cue lines along the sides or bottom – all of these are distractions from the hiring manager reading about your relevant experience for their job.  And in certain cases when the background color requires the font to be white, you’re asking your reader to spend more effort to read your resume than they are on understanding your career.  It’s an easy mistake to avoid.</p><p><strong>Graphics should be avoided on a resume.</strong> As detailed in my <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/resume-parser-ceos-advice-for-your-resume">long interview</a> with the CEOs and technical experts at the world’s five largest resume parsing companies, graphics are ignored by the software that reads the world’s resumes. This makes it especially sad for resumes where “level of skill” in different programming languages is represented by a bar of a certain height. It’s illegible to resume reading software and therefore unhelpful in advancing your career goals.</p><p><strong>Fancy or complex formats don’t help.</strong> Again, it’s understood that your resume is a very, very special document to you. This is your one, true resume, so you feel it warrants a certain degree of sophistication, complexity, and finely-tuned placement of informational elements, thereby hinting at the refined capabilities of the professional behind the resume. This, again, is an error.  A resume isn’t an 18th century calling card meant to make a statement in the foyer. Your human readers are bewildered by your unique choices for data placement, and the resume parsers that turn your resume into useful information for HR’s software systems will, I assure you, make many errors interpreting your novel design.</p><p><strong>Two-column formats cause comprehension mistakes. </strong>Because columns are often implemented as cells, what frequently occurs is that an entire column is flattened together, and then the next, and then the next. This causes important data that belongs together to become separated - employment dates and employment experiences, for example. This, too, makes your resume useless for its intended purpose. By the same lights, you should also avoid three-column resume formats.</p><p><strong>Starting with an MS Word template is another blunder to sidestep.</strong> Many MS Word templates are ancient and have layer upon layer of hidden formatting embedded below their placid surface. This causes all sorts of mischief as your resume is passed about among different recipients, and different companies’ HR systems. </p><p><strong>LinkedIn PDF exports are purposely broken.</strong> LinkedIn makes the majority of its $8 billion in annual revenue by selling access to your information for recruiting purposes. From a business standpoint, they understandably don’t want that data exported and put into someone else’s system for free. So their PDF profile exports are purposely formatted verbosely, with a poor structure that does not play well with the world’s resume parsers.</p><p>And, finally, <strong>headers and footers should be avoided.</strong> On a one-page resume they should be avoided because they’re unnecessary, and on a two-page resume because they’ll be interpreted as part of the data immediately before and after the footer/header. This causes errors ingesting your resume.</p><p>This is a short list of items to avoid on a software engineering resume. If you’d like Leet Resumes to <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">write your technical resume for free</a>, sign up on our <a href="https://leetresumes.com/">homepage</a>, and we’ll avoid these, and many other, hidden errors. <a href="https://leetresumes.com/testimonials">Our users love us!</a></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

Performance Benchmarks</h2> <p>Speed is important for data persistence solutions. Accordingly, we wanted to test how ObjectBox compares performance-wise to other Flutter Dart database options. Therefore, we looked for libraries with comparable levels of storage abstraction and feature set –&nbsp; so not just plain SQL/Key-value storage but also <a href="https://greenrobot.org/android/sqlite-access-with-an-orm-faq/">ORM</a>-like features. <a href="https://objectbox.io/flutter-databases-sqflite-hive-objectbox-and-moor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There doesn’t seem to be that much choice…&nbsp;</a></p> <p>We looked at some two popular approaches: <strong>sqflite</strong> a SQLite wrapper for Flutter (no Dart Native support), and <strong>Hive, </strong>a key-value store with Class-adapters which seems still popular although its technology is phased out (see below). As a third alternative we pulled in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Firestore</a>, which does not really fit as it is no local database, but would be fun to compare anyway.</p> <h3>What we tested</h3> <p>To get an overview of the databases, we tested <strong>CRUD</strong> operations (create, read, update, delete). Each test was run multiple times and executed manually outside of the measured time. Data preparation and evaluation was also done outside of the measured time.</p> <p>We tried to keep the test implementations as close as possible to each other while picking the approaches recommended by the docs for each database. We open sourced the test code at <a href="https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance">https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart-performance</a> if you want to have a closer look.</p> <h3>Performance Benchmark Results</h3> <figure><img width="2222" height="1338" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 2222px, 100vw" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png 2222w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9ea992ae66876c4821b4c71df5f6e45b.objectbox-dart-performance-1280x771.png 1280w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a7622f4b339df3e20f43b6b0d4d93c85.objectbox-dart-performance-980x590.png 980w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/c4249ff1e989bcb87ecc02fb380ffc78.objectbox-dart-performance-480x289.png 480w" nitro-lazy-src="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="MzQwOjgxOQ==-1" src="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png" srcset="https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/5462fda416fb395aac0b474fb055ba90.objectbox-dart-performance.png 2222w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9ea992ae66876c4821b4c71df5f6e45b.objectbox-dart-performance-1280x771.png 1280w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/a7622f4b339df3e20f43b6b0d4d93c85.objectbox-dart-performance-980x590.png 980w, https://v1.nitrocdn.com/blgkyuHzbfskTvjvZDdTnmaujBmEmAgk/assets/static/optimized/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/c4249ff1e989bcb87ecc02fb380ffc78.objectbox-dart-performance-480x289.png 480w"></figure> <p>Looking at the results, we can see ObjectBox performing significantly faster than sqflite across the board, with up to 70 times speedup in case of create &amp; update operations. Compared to Hive, the results are a little more varied, with Hive being faster at reading objects than ObjectBox (we come to that later in our outlook), and ObjectBox being faster at creating objects, about four times faster at updates and three times for deletes. As a mostly-online database, it becomes clear that Firestore’s performance is not really comparable.</p> <h3>Implementation notes</h3> <p><strong>ObjectBox:</strong> This release largely boosted the performance. The remaining bottlenecks are due to Dart itself and how it allows to modify byte buffers. There’s potential to double the speed if we look at other languages supported by ObjectBox. And if that’s not happening soon, we’d still have the option to do some low-level hacks…</p> <p><strong>Sqflite:</strong> a wrapper around SQLite, which is a relational database without direct support for Dart objects. Each dart object field is mapped to a column in the database, as per <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite#sql-helpers">sqflite docs</a>, i.e. converting between the Dart class and a Map.</p> <p><strong>Hive:</strong> We’ve tested with the latest Hive release, which is <a href="https://github.com/hivedb/hive/issues/246">technically discontinued</a>. The author hit two architectural roadblocks (RAM usage and queries) and is currently in the process to do a rewrite from scratch.<br><strong>Update:</strong> strictly speaking it’s not straightforward to directly compare e.g. ObjectBox vs. Hive. In Hive, the high read numbers result from Dart objects already cached in memory. If the objects are fetched using the async API from disk, the numbers drop by factor 1000.</p> <p><strong>Firestore:</strong> This is totally apples and oranges, but we still decided to include Firebase/Firestore as it seems at least somewhat popular to “persist data”. It’s quite Cloud centric and thus offers limited offline features. For example, in order to use batches (“transactions”), an internet connection is required to “commit”. Also, due to its low performance, the test configuration was different: batches of 500 objects and only 10 runs.</p> <h3>Test setup</h3> <p>We ran the benchmarks as a Flutter app on a Android 10 device with a Kirin 980 CPU. The app executed all operations in batches of 10.000 objects, with each batch forming a single transaction. Each test was run 50 times, averaging the results over all the runs. This ensured the VM warmup (optimization) during the first run and garbage collections don’t affect the overall result significantly. (We care about accurate benchmarks; <a href="https://objectbox.io/how-to-benchmark-database-performance-and-objectbox/">read more about our benchmarking best practices here.</a>)</p> <h2>Outlook</h2> <p>With this latest release, we’re not far away from a stable API for a 1.0 release (<strong>🎉</strong>), so please share your thoughts and feedback. For the next release, we’ll add features like async operations, more relation types and some smaller improvements. We are also working on an <a href="https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/issues/185"><strong>ObjectBox variant for the Web platform</strong></a> that is planned close to the 1.0 release. And of course there is <a href="https://objectbox.io/sync/">ObjectBox Data Sync</a> for Flutter/Dart.

		</div>
<p>Just three weeks since the first Israeli citizen received the BioNTech/Pfizer jab — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself — the country has raced ahead of the rest of world with vaccinations, covering about 20 percent of its population to date.</p>



<p>Reasons behind this roaring start are fast emerging: Netanyahu revealed on January 7 that Israel struck an agreement with Pfizer to exchange citizens' data for 10 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine, including a promise of shipments of 400,000-700,000 doses every week. </p>



<p>Under this agreement, Israel will provide details<strong> </strong>to Pfizer (as well as and the World Health Organization) about the age, gender and medical history of those receiving the jab as well as its side effects and efficacy. No identifying information will be given in order to maintain some privacy. </p>



<p>Ten million doses are a drop in the ocean for Pfizer, which has pledged to produce 1.3 billion vaccine doses in 2021 — and is likely to produce more. Once regulatory approval came in mid-December — ahead of the EU — Israel was waiting with its syringes out, making it worthwhile for Pfizer to remove the first vaccines from its production line to one of the first countries that would use them.</p>



<p>The news couldn't come soon enough for Israel. It has reported more than&nbsp;495,000 COVID-19 cases and 3,689&nbsp;deaths since the beginning of the pandemic — alarmingly high figures for the small country of 9 million.</p>



<p>Pfizer clearly has much to gain by rolling out its vaccine in Israel, turning it into the global pilot for a rapid vaccination campaign — and the depth of results now available to Pfizer, especially if successful, can boost marketing worldwide. </p>



<p>"We convinced them that if they give their vaccine to us first, we will know exactly how to administer it in the shortest time possible — and this is precisely what happened," Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told POLITICO via his spokesperson.&nbsp;"We were prepared early, signed the agreements early, and told pharmaceuticals they would see results early. It's a win-win situation."&nbsp;</p>



<p>With some days seeing more than 150,000 people getting vaccinated, Edelstein said, he's confident about Israel's success: "We continue to lead worldwide."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, health authorities aren't answering direct questions about the exact number of doses Israel has secured or how much it paid for them, saying only that the country signed secret agreements with manufacturers as the vaccination campaign began. </p>



<p>Also unclear was the price it had paid for the Pfizer jab — until January 5, when officials disclosed off-the-record that Israel paid $30 per person. That's more than twice the amount listed by Belgium, for example, which accidentally revealed its vaccine price list when <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/belgian-secretary-of-state-accidentally-reveals-eu-vaccine-prices/" target="_blank">Belgium's secretary of state</a> tweeted it. Then, on Monday night,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-be-paying-average-of-47-per-person-for-pfizer-moderna-vaccines/">an Israeli public broadcaster</a>&nbsp;reported an even higher price, at $47 per person.</p>



<p>Netanyahu — who is hoping to get reelected in March — has also repeatedly brought up his close relationships with the chief executives of Pfizer and Moderna, suggesting his connections helped secure millions of doses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I speak to them all the time," Netanyahu said. He added that Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, a descendant of a Jewish family from Thessaloniki, is "a great friend" of Israel.</p>



<h3>Small country, strong health care</h3>



<p>Israel has a mandatory public health system connected to a nationwide digital network. Health maintenance organizations keep digital records of all patients, allowing any authorized computer to extract people's medical data since birth — including past hospitalizations, prescribed medications and vaccinations.</p>



<p>"An operation at such scale could not have happened in a private health care system," said a senior nurse at Israel's renowned Ichilov hospital in Tel Aviv, who preferred to remain anonymous. She has vaccinated hundreds of people against the coronavirus so far.</p>



<p>"I have never seen so many health care workers volunteering their free time for the greater cause like this," she explained. The sense of social solidarity and the feeling of being in this together has contributed massively to the speed of Israel's vaccination campaign — "perhaps more so than in other countries," she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For now, Israel is prioritizing people older than 60, health workers and people with medical conditions, followed by over-55s with underlying conditions. At this point, more than 72 percent of people aged 60 and older have been vaccinated.</p>



<h3>Not without hurdles</h3>



<p>Israelis have so far only been receiving the Pfizer jab, but the country has also secured deals with Britain's AstraZeneca and U.S. manufacturer Moderna. The latter announced last Tuesday that its vaccine had been approved by the Israeli health ministry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderna promised to supply 6 million doses, enough to vaccinate 3 million people<strong>. </strong>Israel&nbsp;has already received the first of an expected four shipments coming over the next few weeks, with a second shipment of about 480,000 doses expected Wednesday or Thursday.&nbsp; </p>



<p>Bottlenecks or distribution hurdles aren't solved once imported doses cross the border, however. Unlike the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, the Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius, which requires special storage techniques.</p>



<p>These jabs are handled by SLE, the logistics unit of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Thirty underground freezers located in a facility near Israel's main international airport hold about 5 million doses, which are then repackaged into 100-dose bundles and delivered across the country.</p>



<p>Distributing the jabs quickly is crucial, and this is one area where the eagerness among Israelis to get vaccinated is accelerating the effort. Interest is so high that every day, <a href="https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001356148,%20https://www.themarker.com/news/health/.premium-MAGAZINE-1.9430992]" target="_blank">queues of younger people</a> hoping for leftover doses form in front of inoculation stations. WhatsApp groups filled with people contacting each other to secure these doses have also appeared.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Ahead of the pack </h3>



<p>Despite leading vaccination campaigns worldwide, Israel has come under fire from human rights groups and news organizations for failing to provide vaccines to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. The Palestinian health ministry has more than 100,000 confirmed cases in the West Bank, with more than 1,100 deaths, in a population of roughly 3 million. Gaza has reported over 45,000 cases in 2 million residents, with more than 400 fatalities.</p>



<p>There is also the issue of cross-border traffic: About 60,000 Palestinian workers enter Israel every day, most of whom work in the construction industry. But Israel only started testing them in December, when the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) announced it would start conducting sample testing.</p>



<p>Despite the urgent situation, the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank has not publicly asked for Israeli assistance in vaccine procurement, and Hamas, which controls the Gaza strip, is highly unlikely to coordinate with Israel in any vaccination effort. </p>



<p>But according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for marketing the main Russian vaccine against COVID-19, known as Sputnik V, the Palestinian health ministry has approved its jab for use on Monday, with the first shipment of the shot expected to arrive next month.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Palestinian general director of public health Yasser Bozyeh said that the PA had also sought supplies from Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, in addition to supplies expected through COVAX, the WHO's vaccine program for poor and middle-income countries.</p>



<p>Still, Israeli media&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/israel-sends-palestinian-authority-vaccines-for-humanitarian-cases-654508" target="_blank">reported last Wednesday</a>&nbsp;that thousands of doses have already been passed to the West Bank, a claim which was&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/palestinians-accuse-israel-of-shirking-duty-to-supply-covid-19-vaccines-654946" target="_blank">later denied by the PA Health Ministry</a>.</p>



<p>There also remain pockets of communities that might hold out. Israel's Arab minority — about 21 percent of the population — has <a href="https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general" target="_blank">shown wariness</a> towards vaccination. And numerous ultra-orthodox Jewish communities are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/world/middleeast/israel-coronavirus-vaccine-palestinians.html,%20https://www.wsj.com/articles/israels-covid-19-vaccinations-hold-lessons-for-u-s-11610307240," target="_blank">ignoring</a> the coronavirus-control measures altogether, resulting in infection rates sometimes five times higher than in many secular cities. </p>



<p>In the meantime, Netanyahu has vowed to increase Israel's vaccination pace to at least 170,000 people per day. But as many of his critics point out, it takes more than a country’s leader to secure such operation.</p>



<p>"Personally, I am truly excited to take part in the vaccination efforts,"&nbsp;said the Ichilov senior nurse, who's also a fierce critic of the prime minister.&nbsp;"The amount of people wholeheartedly committed to this operation is what made it all possible."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>From each of our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoineboulanger/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two</a>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasrb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experiences</a> starting out as introductory-level engineers at Box, to becoming first-time managers overseeing five-person teams, then directors overseeing 30-50, and ultimately VPs managing hundreds, we've experienced software engineering from every angle.</p>
<p>At every step of the way, we asked ourselves: "how do we know if we are bringing value as engineering leaders?" Effective leadership uniquely blends human qualities - influence, empathy, courage, and <strong>results</strong>. This latter quality always brings the question of productivity - how effective are you at producing results through enabling others?</p>
<p>Since the advent of the software industry, most engineering teams have seen productivity as a black box. Only recently have people even begun to build internal tools that optimize performance. Unfortunately, most of these tools measure the wrong metrics and are shockingly similar across companies. We even built some of these tools and made mistakes. Now, we'd like to share the way forward.Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="engineering-effectiveness-is-behind-the-times">Engineering Effectiveness is Behind the TimesÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Engineering teams are both the most expensive and most fundamental part of tech companies. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/every-company-is-now-a-tech-company-1543901207" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more companies become tech-enabled</a>, the importance of engineering will only increase. Yet today, a full three decades after the advent of the internet, most engineering departments still rely exclusively on qualitative signals of performance.</p>
<p><strong>The evolution of engineering effectiveness is paralleling the spirit of sales' recent transformation</strong>. In the early 2000s, sales was considered an art, so sales leaders could skate by on charisma alone. Today, with tools like <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>, <a href="https://www.clari.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Clari</a>, and <a href="https://people.ai/get-demo/?utm_campaign=demorequest&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_term=se-goog-1089&amp;utm_content=demorequest&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxp-ABhALEiwAXm6Iye9qQZaeojCPMvXn73zi-TRqbT93l7waQz3_uSadhOtpXncm8OLtvBoClTkQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">People.ai</a>, sales has fully executed the transition toward scientific, metric-based leadership for analyzing and improving performance.</p>
<p>In the coming years, engineering will adopt a similar, data-driven mode of management. In making this transition, however, most engineering teams are making these mistakes:</p>
<h3 id="mistake-1-measuring-approximations-of-output">Mistake #1: Measuring Approximations of Output</h3>
<p>In their haste to become more data-driven, many engineering leaders are measuring their team's performance based on metrics intended to approximate output. <strong>These metrics fail because they encourage engineers to game the system.</strong></p>
<p>If you measure a fixed metric like lines of code or number of tickets closed, your engineers will begin splitting code into more lines or breaking bug fixes into multiple tickets. Even sprint points, which attempt to convert engineering work into a standard unit, suffer from this pitfall: Some engineers will slow down after reaching their sprint points for the week while others will strategically inflate their tasks to be awarded additional points.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced engineers will recognize that this type of measurement is fake</strong>. While they may not be as influenced to "play the game," their morale will plummet and they will self-select out. By rewarding approximated metrics of output, you're encouraging engineers to increase them regardless of how they correlate with software development success.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter which metrics you choose, abstract output approximations will distract engineers from their actual jobs, ultimately decreasing both your team's effectiveness and morale.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mistake-2-not-measuring-anything">Mistake #2: Not Measuring Anything</h3>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum sit engineering leaders who avoid measurement entirely. Many of these leaders have heard about the dangers of measuring the wrong metrics and therefore <strong>ricochet to the other extreme</strong>. They may emphasize the artisanal and social dimensions of engineering, claiming "software engineering is too complex to measure."</p>
<p>Non-measurement can even be self-reinforcing, because it places the leader into the position of being "the good guy." Instead of being a metrics-obsessed big brother, the leader can be the <strong>friendly older brother exclusively focused on keeping their team happy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Non-measurement fails because it prioritizes politics over productivity.</strong> If you don't measure any metrics, your engineering leaders will simply justify failures, telling stories like "The customer didn't give us the right requirements" or "We were surprised by unexpected vacations." Software development is complex enough that something always goes wrong; if you don't measure any data, you're at the mercy of individual stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Non-measurement unfairly rewards people with charisma while productive but less-persuasive engineers wallow in frustration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point, your top performers will see through these political machinations and quit because your culture lacks accountability.</p>
<p>In the short term, non-measurement can have a positive effect on team morale but it destroys morale in the long-term, especially among high performers.Â&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-measure-blockers-at-the-team-level">The Solution: Measure Blockers at the Team LevelÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Instead of measuring some approximation of engineering output, software teams should measure actual, observable metrics that directly correlate to effectiveness.</p>
<p>Productivity is a relationship between inputs and output. In software development, the inputs are a blend of factors--technical, individual, human, etc.--while the output should be functional software that creates value for customers. <strong>Productivity in engineering therefore naturally increases when you remove the blockers getting in the way of your team.</strong></p>
<h3 id="why-you-should-measure-blockers">Why You Should Measure Blockers</h3>
<p>Even at the beginning of the software revolution, there existed the notion that engineers should be nurtured. Starting with Microsoft in the '80s, tech companies gave engineers free resources (like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/free-food-silicon-valley-tech-employees-apple-google-facebook-2018-7#google-has-so-much-free-food-employees-worry-about-gaining-the-google-15-4" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">food</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-amazing-health-and-fitness-benefits-2019-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gyms</a>) that would remove blockers to their work. Empirical management practices over the last forty years have reinforced the importance of "<a href="https://www.axelos.com/news/blogs/january-2020/the-importance-of-servant-leadership" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">servant leadership</a>" and "<a href="https://www.mugo.ca/Blog/The-most-important-web-project-management-skill-the-ability-to-unblock-others" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unblocking your team</a>," while <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/report/2020-state-of-devops-report/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent research</a> emphasizes the importance of optimized inputs and best practices.</p>
<p>For engineers, these inputs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality of developer tools</li>
<li>Frequency and quality of internal activities (like meetings or code reviews)Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>Focused <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maker time</a> (free from disruptive meetings)</li>
<li>Easy access to documentation</li>
<li>Psychological safety on the team</li>
<li>Work-life balance</li>
<li>Presence of other high-performersÂ&nbsp;</li>
<li>A fair system of rewards</li>
</ul>
<p>The blockers to these inputs already exist and can be quantified, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much free, uninterrupted time does an engineer have to code?</li>
<li>How long is an engineer waiting on a response from another engineer's review?</li>
<li>How often do dev tools get in the way instead of helping accelerate work?Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>How often are engineers required to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">context switch</a>, preventing <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deep work</a>?</li>
<li>How often do engineers receive pages outside of business hours, interrupting their sleep or family life?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An engineering leader exists to enable their team to achieve their goals.</strong> Together, these quantified blockers allow engineering leaders to answer key questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is preventing the engineers from building faster?</li>
<li>What issues are arising in real time?Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</li>
<li>What technology or process investments would increase team engagement?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each engineering team is unique, so its blockers will be specific. It's not so simple as "more maker time is better." If your engineering team is new or temporarily misaligned on key goals, more meeting time might be the answer. What never changes is the need for measurement and well-considered, deliberate decisions.</p>
<p>Over the last year, COVID-19 has helped demonstrate the value of measuring blockers. For many leaders running newly remote teams, <a href="https://www.ventureharbour.com/remote-work-challenges-solutions/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new blockers have arisen</a> that would never have been noticed if managers were only focusing on the desired outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your team is full of competent, driven engineers, removing their blockers is the fastest way to enable forward movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-team-is-the-right-level-to-improve">Why "Team" is the Right Level to Improve</h3>
<p>Since software development requires complex interaction between team members, it would be inappropriate to assign individuals their own metrics: Some engineers are effective individual contributors while others enable their teammates to perform. Engineers also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/okay-nabs-funding-from-sequoia-to-build-performance-dashboards-for-engineering-managers/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hate being micromanaged</a>, so tracking individual activity can make them feel untrusted.</p>
<p><strong>Just as a sports team wins or loses together, so too should the engineering team be treated as the fundamental unit of success.</strong></p>
<p>Approaching engineering at the team level also places the proper accountability on the manager. It raises helpful questions like "What behaviors, structures, and work habits are preventing us from succeeding?"</p>
<p>Looking at the team level also enables managers to catch blockers as they evolve. Small issues, for instance, may not be apparent when the company is young, but can evolve into 10,000 papercuts only apparent at the team level. If code reviews take days instead of hours, at first one engineer complains, then two, then three... and if you don't pay attention, years later the engineering culture is shot. By compiling these small quantifications and observing their trends, a manager can understand whether a report is one individual's experience or truly relevant to the overall performance of the team.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, if blockers follow a constant evolution (e.g. one person is often the canary in the coalmine), an engineering leader can map how the new blockers are likely to evolve and prioritize which should be solved first.</p>
<p>Just as an airplane pilot must monitor dozens of different metrics to keep the plane flying, so too would an engineering leader benefit from viewing their team's metrics to understand overall performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an optimal engineering dashboard, a leader would be able to assess the blockers that prevent the ultimate success of their team.Â&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="toward-engineering-effectiveness">Toward Engineering EffectivenessÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>"Productivity" is an appropriate measure for someone making widgets at a factory: "How many products did you produce in an hour?"</p>
<p>Engineering should instead be about effectiveness: "How able is this engineer to effect positive impact?"</p>
<p>Looking forward, engineering effectiveness will have three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Measuring the experience of engineering teams in their most frequent activities. (Think<a href="https://www.scalyr.com/blog/distributed-tracing-important-2019/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> distributed tracing</a>, but for human activities.)</li>
<li>Using the …</li></ol></div></div></div>

<p>There's a Yom Kippur joke I love: the rabbi and the richest man in town are praying, "Oh Lord, I am nothing, I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The synagogue's janitor sees them and joins in: "I am nothing!"</p>
<p>The richest man says to the rabbi: "Look who thinks he's nothing."</p>
<p>The humblebrag is a wild phenomena, and it's endemic to a certain kind of tech criticism. When a technologist – what Maria Farrell calls a "prodigal tech bro" – confesses that he's an evil genius, then "genius" is the point.</p>
<p><a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/">https://crookedtimber.org/2020/09/23/story-ate-the-world-im-biting-back/</a></p>
<p>Think of the "AI" scientists who claim that they are about to be responsible for massive waves of technological unemployment, seeming to confess to a sin while actually overpromising on their AI.</p>

<p>Or the critique of "surveillance capitalism" that takes at face value ad-tech's outlandish boasts about how good they are at changing peoples' minds with data-mining, and then warns that we're all about to be enslaved to mind-control tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59">https://onezero.medium.com/how-to-destroy-surveillance-capitalism-8135e6744d59</a></p>
<p>Or the hand-wringing over the "trolley problem" of self-driving cars, as though the issue with these cars will be their reliable fine-grained judgments, rather than their unreliability and anticompetitive fealty to their manufacturers.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>This is what Lee Vinsel calls "criti-hype," criticism that actually builds on – and depends on – maintaining the halo of devastating potency that surrounds overhyped technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5">https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5</a></p>
<p>While it's true that the social problems that technologies create have unique, subtle elements that require a fine-grained understanding of the underlying science, it's a mistake to assume this obviates historical lessons.</p>
<p>Like, blockchain and proof-of-work and cryptography do bring unique facets to the problems of financial engineering, money-laundering and fraud – but all the problems of financial engineering and money-laundering and fraud are still in the mix.</p>
<p>Ad-tech and engagement-maximization systems add new wrinkles to the problems of communications monopolies and the epistemological chaos created by corrupt institutions, but the chaos and the monopolies are still central to these problems.</p>
<p>The problem with many metacritics of tech – people who criticize tech critics – is their assumption that tech is irrelevant. The problem with tech critics themselves is their assumption that tech is dispositive.</p>
<p>The reality is that tech has formal characteristics – the universality of Turing completeness – that both expand the policy toolkit (the power of interoperability mandates) and constrain it (the futility of cryptography back-doors).</p>
<p>Criti-hype is real, and its remedy isn't to ignore technicalities and criticize tech as though it was just another industry – the remedy is to really understand what tech can and can't do, and to understand that the industry isn't run by super-genuises (evil or otherwise) nor science heroes (or villains).</p>

<p>2018 was almost the year we won the Right to Repair.</p>
<p>Instead, 2018 turned out to be the year we lost R2R: 20 bills defeated in 20 state houses, and it was mostly Apple's fault.</p>
<p>Apple has a problem. As CEO Tim Cook warned his investors at the conclusion of his company's repair-killing lobbying spree, Apple's profits depend on people throwing away their devices, not fixing them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/01/letter-from-tim-cook-to-apple-investors/</a></p>
<p>By monopolizing repairs, Apple doesn't just get to gouge you on parts and service – the real action is in pronouncing your device DOA, beyond repair. Then you have to buy another one.</p>
<p>Other companies lobbied hard against R2R: John Deere, GM, and other monopolists backed Apple's play. But Apple wrote the playbook, coming up with risible bullshit like claims that blocking independent repair is essential to protecting privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf">https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/apple%20rfi%20-%20signed.pdf</a></p>
<p>Apple's anti-repair FUD got picked up and amplified by Big Car in 2020, when they spent millions fighting an automotive R2R ballot initiative in Massachusetts, claiming that letting independent mechanics at your car would lead to your actual <em>murder</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r">https://pluralistic.net/2020/11/13/said-no-one-ever/#r2r</a></p>
<p>2018 is the year we lost Right to Repair, but 2021 might be the year we win it. We're only a month in and 14 states are already debating R2R legislation, with more to come. The Repair Coalition and PIRG are leading the fight, buoyed by massive R2R successes in the EU.</p>
<p>Independent repair isn't just fair and it isn't just good for the planet – it's also good for the nation and its economy. The average US family loses $330/year thanks to anti-repair practices, a $40b drag on the American economy.</p>
<p>Repair creates local jobs for SMEs whose earnings – from helping their neighbors – are taxed (not hidden in offshore tax-havens) and contribute to their communities. These are on-shore, dignified tech jobs – not slave labor in Xinjiang or coerced labor in a Foxconn plant.</p>
<p>Repair diverts ewaste from landfills. Each kiloton of ewaste creates &lt;1 landfill jobs, or 15 recyling jobs.</p>
<p>But that same kiloton of ewaste creates 200 local repair jobs.</p>

<p>Repair creates a secondary market for low-cost devices that find their way into the hands of people on the wrong side of the digital divide – a divide that got starker and more consequential during the pandemic, and will only get more important in years to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the pandemic: anti-repair laws meant that when PB840 ventilators (the most common ventilator, sold by the monopolist Medtronic, which benefits from the largest-ever tax-avoidance "reverse takeover" in corporate history) broke, they couldn't be legally fixed.</p>
<p>Instead, desperate med-tech people turned to a lone Polish hacker who built Medtronic defeat devices into old guitar-pedals and clock radios to get around the anti-repair measures in the ventilators that hospitals had bought and paid for.</p>

<p>R2R is a fight for justice. For the right to decide who fixes your stuff. For the right to set up shop and help your neighbors. For self-reliance and resiliency over profits. For on-shore small businesses over multinational cheaters.</p>
<p>Once again, a wave of R2R laws is sweeping the nation. The monopolists who profiteered off our misery during the pandemic will once again turn out to stop them. PIRG and the Repair Coalition need our support – as do their coalition allies like EFF.</p>

<p>When you hear the phrase "free market," you probably think of "a market that is free from regulation" but that's the opposite of the phrase's original meaning!</p>
<p>Adam Smith used the term to describe a market that was free from "economic rents" – money earned by owning things, rather than doing things. Smith recognized that markets attract parasites – "rentiers" – who seek to drain wealth by "investing" rather than building and doing.</p>
<p>Which meant that, in the absence of muscular state  intervention, markets would become less and less free – more and more dependent on the whims of rentiers who used money to breed money by creating toll-barriers between parts of the productive economy.</p>
<p>For Smith, markets were only free if they were regulated. But that's the opposite of the way that we talk about free markets today. Today, a free market is a market where you are free to collect rents – passive income from owning things, at the expense of people doing things.</p>
<p>This is true in so many metaphorical ways, but it's especially true when we're talking about actual rent – actual homes that people need to survive and produce, whose primary role today is to serve as an asset class to be maximized, not a basic human right.</p>
<p>London is ground zero for the conversion of housing from a human right to a speculative asset, a city at war with itself, filled up with empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, while productive workers – the "essential workers" of the pandemic – triple-up in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The conversion of London from a city to an asset was hugely profitable, primarily for offshore "investors," especially criminals who were attracted by London's veneer of respectability, which allowed them to convert their loot to legitimate earnings through property sales.</p>
<p>The overslosh of these tremendous cash flows has hopelessly corrupted London's planning authorities, who are absolutely helpless and hopeless at holding developers to their own promises – new builds get extra storeys and shed public concessions without penalty.</p>
<p>And just as the tax-authorities who despair of enforcing against the real cheats turn their efforts to everyday people who can't afford to fight investigations, London's planners spend their days making life miserable for homeowners trying to make minor improvements.</p>
<p>I spent two years fighting Hackney for the right to build a small, windowed greenhouse on my flat's balcony, finally giving up on growing my own veggies. Meanwhile, the for-profit "student residence" across the street replaced hundreds of small offices, overbuilt and busted.</p>
<p>Today, it's a failed Wework, while the four-storey "boutique hotel" across the street has been transformed into eight+ storeys, with multiple storeys of office space, all without any planning enforcement.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>The <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/04/learn-the-command-line/">command line is a powerful tool</a>, and writing shell scripts lets you write a series of commands once and replay them any time you like.</p>



<p>But sometimes you will write a series of commands without putting them into a script. This may be because you are exploring a problem or because you haven’t bothered to put together a script. No sense in making something repeatable if you aren’t sure exactly how you are going to repeat it.</p>



<p>But you may want to look back over past commands you have run, whether to run them again, modify them or even just remind yourself what you’ve done. For this, the shell history is very handy. Another time I often look at the shell history is when I am signing into a machine that I don’t visit very often. Perhaps there’s a command to look at some log files that I know, distantly, in the back of my mind, that I ran four weeks ago. I could have documented it, but maybe I didn’t. If I look in my command line history, I can see it.</p>



<p>All of the examples below are for the bash shell. Why? This is a very common shell, more modern shells like zsh are roughly compatible, and most importantly, this is the shell I know.</p>



<p>To use the shell history, first you have to know it exists and then you have to see it. You can also view the history by typing <code>history</code> in your terminal or at the shell prompt. Here’s an example from one of my shells:</p>


<pre title="">  520  vi text.adoc
  521  git status
  522  git add text.adoc
  523  git commit -m "Initial pass at examples and documentation."
  524  vi text.adoc
  525  git add text.adoc
  526  git commit -m "Added one more example." text.adoc
  527  git push origin add-example-docs
  528  history
</pre>


<p>Each line is one command and is numbered. From here, I can repeat a command by number. So if I type <code>!524</code> the command <code>vi text.adoc</code> will be run. I can also search for a certain string by using grep:</p>


<pre title="">history | grep 'ssh' # will show all my ssh commands
</pre>


<p>The above commands are all pretty simple, but you can also link commands together. I often will do something like this:</p>


<pre title="">cd directory &amp;&amp; mvn jar &amp;&amp; cp file.jar ~/place/jar/goes &amp;&amp; cd otherdirectory
</pre>


<p>Once I get this command right, I can run it over and over again by referencing its line number. The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> means that each command has to succeed before subsequent commands are run. So if the <code>mvn</code> command fails, the <code>cp</code> will not run.</p>



<p>This is fine for running tasks that are not going to change, but what about if I want to edit my previous commands. You can navigate the history by using the arrow keys (there are other ways as well, but arrow keys are the default and most accessible). Each up arrow takes you one step further back in your history, and each down arrow takes you one step forward. At any point you can edit the command you are currently on and hit the enter key and run it.</p>



<p><strong>The bang shortcuts</strong></p>



<p>If you know you want to edit whatever command you ran previously, you can use some bang operator shortcuts (so called because “bang” refers to a <code>!</code>). Let’s say I want to get the latest <code>main</code> branch from my git repo. </p>



<p>Suppose I run the command:</p>


<pre title="">gti fetch origin main
</pre>


<p>I see an error message because I misspelled <code>git</code>. Whoops. I can type:</p>


<pre title="">git !*
</pre>


<p><code>!*</code> expands to everything except the first argument in the previous line, so this is the command that is run:</p>


<pre title="">git fetch origin main
</pre>


<p>Now I want to check out the <code>main</code> branch</p>


<pre title="">git checkout !$
</pre>


<p><code>!$</code> refers to the last argument of the command, so <code>main</code> in this case. The command which is run is then:</p>


<pre title="">git checkout main
</pre>


<p>Knowing these shortcuts will help you avoid tediously hitting the arrow keys, editing the previous command and re-running it. There’s one more bang shortcut which is very useful. Suppose I want to install something on a linux box:</p>


<pre title="">apt-get install pkgname
</pre>


<p>Whoops again! I’ll get an error message because I’m not root. Easily fixed by typing:</p>


<pre title="">sudo !!
</pre>


<p><code>!!</code> expands to the entire previous command, so what is actually run is:</p>


<pre title="">sudo apt-get install pkgname
</pre>


<p>I use this very often when working with linux on the command line.</p>



<p><strong>Controlling what is saved</strong></p>



<p>You can control how much history is kept. Sometimes on my development machine I keep an infinite amount of it. I’ve also been on production instances where there was no history kept, I believe as a security measure. Remember, any command you run, including opening up a database connection using a command line client, will be kept in the history buffer. If you put a password on the command line, it will be recorded in this history.</p>



<p>To avoid that, don’t put the password on the command line. Another trick is to set the <code>HISTCONTROL</code> variable. When this is set to <code>ignoreboth</code> any command you type with a space in front won’t be stored in the history.</p>


<pre title="">export HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth # previously set
echo "hello" # included in history
 echo "goodbye" # not included
</pre>


<p>You can also control explicitly how many commands to store in your history with the <code>HISTSIZE</code> setting:</p>


<pre title="">export HISTSIZE=2000 # will save 2000 commands
</pre>


<p>Finally, be aware that all the bash shells opened share the same history file. Unless you take special care (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/57724/keep-all-commands-in-bash-history">as outlined here</a>) the last one closed will win.</p>



<p>Being able to quickly re-run commands you’ve built previously, whether unchanged or not, can be helpful when you are navigating around the command line in pursuit of your software goals. Knowing a few history commands lets you do so.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

For subscriptions / SaaS products LTV is calculated differently and will be the topic of a future post.</blockquote><h2 id="ltv-explained">LTV Explained</h2><p>LTV is a modeled value that gives us a simple way to reason about a customer's changing behavior (purchase amount, retention, and cadence) using a simple metric.</p><p><br>It’s a prediction of future value generated from each customer and it's made up of the following components:</p><ol><li><strong>Retention</strong> Customers become more valuable as they have more orders</li><li><strong>Average Order Value</strong> Customers who spend more are more valuable</li><li><strong>Time Between Orders</strong> The time it takes for customers to come back will drive the time horizon over which LTV is realized</li></ol><h2 id="calculating-ltv">Calculating LTV</h2><blockquote>Before we dive in: Narrator can provide this analysis and many others in minutes using your data. <a href="https://calendly.com/narrator-team/demo?utm_source=blog">Chat</a> with us and we'll show you how!</blockquote><p>LTV uses retention patterns to understand a customer's likelihood to reach the nth order, then multiplies it with the revenue value in order to come up with the expected revenue from the nth order. Finally, the expected revenue is summed up across all orders. From there we'll use the time it takes for customers to order again to estimate the amount of time it will take to realize LTV.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Page-3--1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Page-3--1-.png 600w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Page-3--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Page-3--1-.png 1600w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Page-3--1-.png 2115w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>LTV is a converged value.</strong> LTV is based on the <em>expected</em> revenue that a single customer will generate.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The sum after the 4th order is $156. But what's the value after <strong>all </strong>the orders? At each step the expected value is going down fairly rapidly. It's obviously converging.</p><p>So where do we stop? When the LTV changes by no more than 1%, which will sum up to 95% of its total value. </p><p>For our example, the expected value of the seventh order is $1.22. This is less than 1% of the sum to that point, so we can stop there. That sum is $160.66, so dividing it by 0.95 brings us to a converged value of $169.11</p><figure><img src="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Graphs--11-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Graphs--11-.png 600w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Graphs--11-.png 1000w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Graphs--11-.png 1600w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w2400/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Graphs--11-.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><h2 id="modeling-time-to-accrue-revenue">Modeling Time to Accrue Revenue</h2><p>Now that we know that most of the LTV is accrued in the first 7 orders, we can compute how long it takes a customer to reach this point – we need to understand how much time passes between each order.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><strong>A common error in LTV timing calculations</strong></p>
<div><p>A common mistake is to use historical data to see how long it took customers to reach the converged number of orders (in our case 7).</p><p>

<strong>Why it's dangerous</strong></p></div>
<div><p>The sample size of customers who reached 7 orders will very small, so using them to calculate the time to reach LTV will introduce a lot of error.</p><p>

<strong>A better way</strong></p></div>
<p>Instead, we'll use the median time between orders to calculate a better estimate of the time it takes to reach a given order ocurrence.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This is fairly straightforward. We'll just look at the days between orders and sum them all together.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--5-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--5-.png 600w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--5-.png 1000w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--5-.png 1460w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Summing the days between orders up to the 7th order gives us a total of <strong>266 </strong>days. In other words, we're predicting that it takes 266 days from their first order for customers to reach 95% of their LTV.</p><p>This number can be a very useful timeframe for thinking about return on investment. For example, this can be used to compute the time to recover customer acquisition costs. </p><hr><h2 id="ltv-and-beyond">LTV and Beyond</h2><p>And there it is. Our complete LTV. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--6-.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--6-.png 600w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--6-.png 1000w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--6-.png 1600w, https://blog.narrator.ai/content/images/2021/01/Blog-Diagrams---Export--6-.png 1620w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So where do we go from here? </p><p><strong>Use LTV instead of Average Order Value to represent the value of a customer</strong></p><p>Use LTV for analyses when you need to represent the value of a customer because LTV allows you to reason about their spending, retention, and timing simply using a single metric.</p><ul><li>Ensure operating and acquisition costs stay below LTV to ensure a positive business ROI</li><li>Ensure Product teams prioritize improvements that cater towards high LTV users</li></ul><p><strong>Work on improving order retention and other drivers of LTV</strong></p><p>Conduct a follow up analysis to dive into each of the behaviors that drive LTV. This will &nbsp;identify the areas to focus that will have the biggest impact.</p><hr><h2 id="is-there-an-easier-way">Is there an easier way?</h2><p>Doing a full LTV analysis like this is clearly a lot of work.

<p>Students in Foshan, Guangdong Province, play rope skipping after class. File&nbsp;Photo: VCG</p><p>Chinese education authority has recently vowed to enhance physical education and psychological direction in a response to a previous proposal from a top policy advisor calling on the country to strengthen "masculinity" education for boys, which has ignited heated debate on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposal has won some support, while many on the internet believe it might lead to gender stereotyping. Experts noted that the goals of education should be to train students to be more responsible, and called for a more tolerant and diversified evaluation system for children.</p><p>In a Thursday reply to the proposal on "avoiding feminization of teenage boys," the Chinese Ministry of Education said it will solve the problems from several aspects including enhancing the research on issues related to youth mental health education.</p><p>In May 2020, during the national Two Sessions, Si Zefu, a member of the Standing Committee of the 13th CPPCC National Committee and chairman of Harbin Electric Corporation, said that the "feminization" trend of Chinese teenagers, if not managed effectively, will harm the existence and development of China. "Many Chinese teenage boys nowadays have the characteristics of weakness, low self-esteem and timidity, and they tend to follow the pretty-boy superstars," said Si.&nbsp;</p><p>Si believed this phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that most teachers in schools from kindergarten to high school stage are women, as well as to the frequent appearance of "pretty boys" in TV and films.</p><p>The reply from the Ministry of Education triggered a widespread discussion on the internet over the weekend. The related hashtag has been viewed more than 2 billion times with 250,000 comments as of press time on Sina Weibo.</p><p>Discussions focus on what "masculinity" is and what the boys really need in education.</p><p>"It is a beauty for men to show their toughness in demeanor, spirit, and physique… Education is not only meant to foster 'men' and 'women,' but also duty and responsibility," read a CCTV editorial on Sunday.</p><p>"The anxiety about lack of 'masculinity' is itself a discrimination due to certain kind of mindset. In subconsciousness, such people consider 'female', 'girly' and 'feminine' are bad and each sex should have a certain kind of look in life," noted an editorial on iFeng.com. "Why doesn't the Ministry of Education worry that more physical exercise will make girls too 'masculine?'"</p><p>Sun Yunxiao, an education expert, was quoted by the CNR as saying that while it is true some boys are relatively 'weak,' and the situation calls for attention, people's 'temperaments' are naturally diversified and there is nothing good or bad about it. "We should not attach stereotypes to sexes."</p><p>"Girls could be tough, and boys could be gentle," he said.</p><p>"If masculinity means a boy should not cry, then it is a stereotype," Yu Ka, a primary school teacher in East China's Fujian Province, told the Global Times.</p><p>But Yu also shared his observation that some boys are not as tough as many girls among her students. "I feel boys are too spoiled by families and the society," Yu said, pointing to the traditional mindset of valuing boys.</p><p>Chu Zhaohui, a research fellow at China's National Institute of Education Sciences, called for a diversified evaluation system. "Currently, evaluation is based on scores to a large extent. Even if boys perform well in areas other than learning, they won't get much appreciation. For many boys, they cannot do what they want to do, which is not conducive to cultivating independence, courage and perseverance," Chu told the Global Times.</p><p>"Masculinity means having a relatively strong sense of independence, willpower and perseverance, including physical fitness," Chu said.</p><p>"We should leave it to the nature of the person. We have destroyed the natural state of students and what we need to do now is to correct it and let them return to normal and be more natural," Chu said.</p></div>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>TypeScript and JavaScript have steadily evolved over the last years, and some of the habits we built over the last decades have become obsolete. Some might never have been meaningful. Here's a list of 10 habits that we all should break.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more articles and news about web product development and entrepreneurship, please feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%253A%252F%252Fstartup-cto.net%252F&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;region=follow_link&amp;screen_name=The_Startup_CTO&amp;tw_p=followbutton">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Onto the examples! Please note that each "What it should look like" only fixes the issue discussed, even if there are further code smells that should be addressed.</p>
<h2 id="1notusingstrictmode">1. Not using <code>strict</code> mode</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Using a <code>tsconfig.json</code> without strict mode.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "commonjs"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Just enable <code>strict</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Introducing stricter rules in an existing codebase takes time.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Stricter rules will make it easier to change code in the future, so the time spent on fixing the code is returned and then some when working on the repository in the future.</p>
<h2 id="2definingdefaultvalueswith">2. Defining default values with <code>||</code></h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Falling back with <code>||</code> for optional values:</p>
<pre><code>function createBlogPost (text: string, author: string, date?: Date) {
  return {
    text: text,
    author: author,
    date: date || new Date()
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Use the new <code>??</code> operator, or, even better, define the fallback right at the parameter level.</p>
<pre><code>function createBlogPost (text: string, author: string, date: Date = new Date())
  return {
    text: text,
    author: author,
    date: date
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>The <code>??</code> operator has just been introduced last year, and when using values in the middle of a long function it might be hard to set them already as parameter defaults.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p><code>??</code>, unlike <code>||</code>, falls back only for <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, not for all falsy values. Also, if your functions are so long that you cannot define defaults at the beginning, then splitting them might be a good idea.</p>
<h2 id="3usinganyastype">3. Using <code>any</code> as type</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Using <code>any</code> for data when you are unsure about the structure.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: any = await response.json()
  return products
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>In almost every situation where you type something as <code>any</code>, you should type it as <code>unknown</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  return products as Product[]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p><code>any</code> is convenient, as it basically disables all type-checks. Often, <code>any</code> is used even in official typings (e. g. <code>response.json()</code> from the example above is typed as <code>Promise&lt;any&gt;</code> by the TypeScript team).</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>It basically disables all type-checks. Anything that comes in via <code>any</code> will completely forego any type-checks. This leads to hard to catch bugs, as code will fail only when our assumptions about type structure are relevant to the runtime code.</p>
<h2 id="4valassometype">4. <code>val as SomeType</code></h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Forcefully telling the compiler about a type that it cannot infer.</p>
<pre><code>async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  return products as Product[]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>That's what type guards are for.</p>
<pre><code>function isArrayOfProducts (obj: unknown): obj is Product[] {
  return Array.isArray(obj) &amp;&amp; obj.every(isProduct)
}

function isProduct (obj: unknown): obj is Product {
  return obj != null
    &amp;&amp; typeof (obj as Product).id === 'string'
}

async function loadProducts(): Promise&lt;Product[]&gt; {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.mysite.com/products')
  const products: unknown = await response.json()
  if (!isArrayOfProducts(products)) {
    throw new TypeError('Received malformed products API response')
  }
  return products
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>When converting from JavaScript to TypeScript, the existing codebase often makes assumptions about types that cannot be deduced automatically by the TypeScript compiler. In these cases, throwing in a quick <code>as SomeOtherType</code> can speed up the conversion without having to loosen the settings in tsconfig.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Even if the assertion might be save right now, this might change when someone moves code around. The type guard will ensure that all checks are explicit.</p>
<h2 id="5asanyintests">5. <code>as any</code> in tests</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Creating incomplete stand-ins when writing tests.</p>
<pre><code>interface User {
  id: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

test('createEmailText returns text that greats the user by first name', () =&gt; {
  const user: User = {
    firstName: 'John'
  } as any
  
  expect(createEmailText(user)).toContain(user.firstName)
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>If you need to mock data for your tests, move the mocking logic next to the thing you mock and make it reusable.</p>
<pre><code>interface User {
  id: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
}

class MockUser implements User {
  id = 'id'
  firstName = 'John'
  lastName = 'Doe'
  email = 'john@doe.com'
}

test('createEmailText returns text that greats the user by first name', () =&gt; {
  const user = new MockUser()

  expect(createEmailText(user)).toContain(user.firstName)
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>When writing tests in a codebase that doesn't have great test coverage yet, there are often complicated big data structures, but only parts of it are needed for the specific functionality under test. Not having to worry about the other properties is easier in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Foregoing the creation of a mock will bite us, latest when one of the properties changes and we need to change it in all tests instead of one central location. Also, there will be situations where the code under test relies on properties that we did not deem important before, and then all tests for that functionality need to be updated.</p>
<h2 id="6optionalproperties">6. Optional properties</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Marking properties as optional that are sometimes there and sometimes not.</p>
<pre><code>interface Product {
  id: string
  type: 'digital' | 'physical'
  weightInKg?: number
  sizeInMb?: number
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly model which combinations exist and which don't.</p>
<pre><code>interface Product {
  id: string
  type: 'digital' | 'physical'
}

interface DigitalProduct extends Product {
  type: 'digital'
  sizeInMb: number
}

interface PhysicalProduct extends Product {
  type: 'physical'
  weightInKg: number
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Marking properties as optional instead of splitting out types is easier and produces less code. It also requires a deeper understanding of the product being build and might limit usage of code if assumptions about the product change.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>The big benefit of type systems is that they can replace runtime checks with compile-time checks. With more explicit typing, it is possible to get compile-time checks for bugs that otherwise might have gotten unnoticed, e. g. by making sure that every <code>DigitalProduct</code> has a <code>sizeInMb</code>.</p>
<h2 id="7onelettergenerics">7. One letter generics</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Naming a generic with one letter</p>
<pre><code>function head&lt;T&gt; (arr: T[]): T | undefined {
  return arr[0]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Giving a full descriptive type name.</p>
<pre><code>function head&lt;Element&gt; (arr: Element[]): Element | undefined {
  return arr[0]
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>This habit grew I guess because <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html">even the official docs use one-letter names</a>. It is also quicker to type and requires less thinking to press <code>T</code> instead of writing a full name.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Generic type variables are variables, like any other. We have abandoned the idea of describing the technicalities of variables in their names when IDEs started to just show us these technicalities. E. g. instead of <code>const strName = 'Daniel'</code> we now only write <code>const name = 'Daniel'</code>. Also, one letter variable names are generally frowned upon because it can be hard to decipher what they mean without looking at their declaration.</p>
<h2 id="8nonbooleanbooleanchecks">8. Non-boolean boolean checks</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Checking whether a value is defined by passing the value directly to an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly checking for the condition we care about.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages !== undefined) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>Writing the check in short looks more succinct and allows us to avoid thinking about what we actually want to check.</p>
<h3 id="whyweshouldnt">Why we shouldn't</h3>
<p>Maybe we should think about what we actually want to check. The examples above for example handle the case of <code>countOfNewMessages</code> being <code>0</code> differently.</p>
<h2 id="9thebangbangoperator">9. The Bang Bang operator</h2>
<h3 id="whatitlookslike">What it looks like</h3>
<p>Converting a non-boolean value to boolean.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (!!countOfNewMessages) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whatitshouldlooklike">What it should look like</h3>
<p>Explicitly checking for the condition we care about.</p>
<pre><code>function createNewMessagesResponse (countOfNewMessages?: number) {
  if (countOfNewMessages !== undefined) {
    return `You have ${countOfNewMessages} new messages`
  }
  return 'Error: Could not retrieve number of new messages'
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="whywedoit">Why we do it</h3>
<p>To some, understanding <code>!!</code> is like an initiation ritual to the world of JavaScript. It looks short and succinct, and if you are already used to it, then you know what it is about. It is a shortcut to convert any value to a boolean. Especially if, in a codebase, there is no clear semantic separation between falsy values like <code>nu…</code></p></section></div>

So there was widespread satisfaction last week when members of an online discussion group called WallStreetBets started beating the Wall Street bully boys at their own game. Ringleaders of the group noticed that hedge funds had taken a short position in the videogame retailer GameStop that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">far exceeded</a> the number of shares available to trade. Motivated as much by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6omry/an_open_letter_to_melvin_capital_cnbc_boomers_and/">revenge</a> as by profit, these influencers in the group encouraged the 2.7 million members (since risen to around 8 million) to purchase the stock in order to drive the price higher and create a massive short squeeze. This quickly became a movement with a cause similar to that of Occupy Wall Street, except much more effective because it hit the intended target where they would feel it the most, in the wallet. “The only way to beat a rigged game,” one WallStreetBets leader <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ip6jnv/the_real_greatest_short_burn_of_the_century/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">said</a>, “is to rig it even harder.”&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop stock, which closed at $17.69 a share on Jan. 8, shot up to $347.51 by the close last Wednesday. With combined losses of almost $20 billion, hedge funds were on the ropes and close to bleeding out, selling their longs in an increasingly futile effort to cover their shorts. One fund, Melvin Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/31/melvin-capital-lost-more-than-50percent-after-betting-against-gamestop-wsj.html">lost over half its value</a> and had to be bailed out by <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/steve-cohen-ken-griffin-invest-3-billion-gamestop-short-seller-2021-1-1030003305">hedge fund sugar daddies</a> Ken Griffin (Citadel) and Steve Cohen (Point 72). Another fund, Citron, was teetering on the brink of collapse. All this outsider army needed to win was the continued ability to communicate with each other online, and their collective ability to keep piling into the “Buy” side of the trade. Within hours, they would be hobbled on the first front and crippled on the second.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></p><p>First, the digital distribution platform Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server">banned</a> the WallStreetBets account after the close Wednesday for “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/discord-bans-wallstreetbets-server-hate-speech-reddit-gamestop-gme-2021-1">hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation</a>.” (For a moment, it looked like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/l6i26r/discord_and_reddit_remove_rwallstreetbets/">Reddit had also banned </a>the group, but they resisted pressure to do so.) If the quoted justification sounds familiar, it’s nearly identical to the one given by Google, Apple, and Amazon for deplatforming Parler just three weeks earlier. Echoing Amazon, Discord said it had sent the group repeated warnings about objectionable content before deciding, on that day of all days, to shut them down.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, WallStreetBets investors were locked out of their trading accounts by online brokers such as Robinhood on Thursday morning. Based on new collateral requirements that it says were imposed by an industry consortium, Robinhood forbade its users from buying GameStop and other stocks that WallStreetBets had identified as short squeeze opportunities. Users were allowed only to “close their positions”—in other words, to sell to the shorts desperate to buy. When angry users registered their disapproval by leaving over 100,000 one-star reviews of the Robinhood app in the Google Play Store, Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">deleted</a> them.&nbsp;</p><p>Normal trading was allowed to resume Friday, but the hedge funds used their 24-hour sole ownership of the battlefield to fortify their positions, covering the most vulnerable shorts. Wall Street then sent in reinforcements, as new short positions were taken at these high price levels, virtually guaranteed to pay out when, inevitably, the air leaks out of the balloon. Faced with a game that, for once, they couldn’t rig in their favor, it appeared that the insiders tipped the board over and started a new game. As a massively decentralized online group of scrappy outsiders, the only tools at WallStreetBets’ disposal were online trading and social networking. Both were frozen at the crucial moment, and the hedge fund insiders were let off the hook. The weaponization of censorship is a big part of the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Down the Slippery Slope</strong></p><p>Some of us <a href="https://davidsacks.medium.com/the-speech-cartel-b3f5555f7787">warned</a> of a slippery slope when Parler was taken down and a sitting president was systematically ghosted from every online speech platform. But we could not have foreseen how slippery the slope would be, or how fast we would slide down it. We were told that the curbs on speech of President Trump and his supporters were necessary to prevent further “insurrection” and protect the peaceful transition of power. However, much like the troops and barricades that still ring the Capitol, these speech restrictions remain in place well after the transition of power has occurred. The censorship power is always justified in response to a genuine outrage or crisis, but it is rarely relinquished once the threat passes. Rather it gets weaponized to protect powerful, connected insiders, as the GameStop fiasco illustrates.</p><p>How do we suppose Discord chose that moment to enforce its “Community Guidelines” against WallStreetBets? Almost certainly, one of the hedge funds whose ox was being gored combed through their message boards looking for anything that might violate the terms of service. And surely they found it, as these boards contain the same raunchy language you would hear if you visited any trading floor or boiler room on Wall Street. They presumably reported the content to Discord, which took the group down.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Discord warn WallStreetBets of content violations before last Wednesday? I’m sure they did. Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-responds-parlers-lawsuit-calls-meritless-cites-content-advocating-violence/">sent</a> such a warning letter to Parler as well. Frankly, such a letter could be, and likely is, sent to every large message board on the web. The founder of a user-generated content site described it to me as “the One Percent Problem.” Every user-generated content site will have a small percentage of offensive material that gets through, no matter how many content moderators are hired. For example, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook">allowed far more content</a> advocating for and planning the Capitol riot than Parler. But instead of acknowledging this, they were eager to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">blame</a> the upstart, which had recently taken over the top spot in the social networking category in the app store. Scapegoating Parler served the dual purpose of deflecting blame and squashing a competitor.</p><p>Critics of social networks insist that these sites simply need to double down on censorship in order to finally rid us of problematic speech. But that ignores how social media moderation actually works. Algorithms set to recognize keywords capture only a small fraction of problematic posts, leaving millions of posts for humans to review. The work is so voluminous that it’s outsourced to far-flung locales where English may not even be the first language. Low-level employees must decipher complicated guidelines while navigating our increasingly Byzantine world of political and cultural hot-buttons. Mistakes are inevitable, and the harder a company tightens the standards to get the One Percent Problem down to 0.1 or 0.01 percent, the more undeserving accounts—from <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/ron-paul-blocked-accessing-facebook-page-over-violating-community-standards-1560639">Ron Paul</a> to the <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/01/23/pers-j23.html">Socialist Equality Party</a>—will be swept up in the dragnet. With the Town Square now digitized, centralized, and privatized in the hands of a cartel of Big Tech companies, the protections of the First Amendment no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insiders Vs. Outsiders</strong></p><p>Censorship is about who has the power to censor, and what checks are placed upon that power. Right now, tech companies have all the power, and they exercise it as a like-minded cartel. When we see Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz voice similar concerns over what happened to WallStreetBets last week, we should realize that the politics of this issue in the post-Trump era will no longer divide along an axis of Left and Right, but of insider and outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, when she started landing blows against Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis, met with President Obama’s economics adviser, the former treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers. He presented her with a choice: “I could be an insider or I could be an outsider,” she recalled in her 2014 memoir, <em>A Fighting Chance</em>. “Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: <em>They don’t criticize other insiders</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s precisely this insider-protection scheme that the internet and social media have most disrupted. Insiders are massively powerful but few in number. Outsiders have always been numerous but unorganized. Social networking and online organizing have given the outsiders real power to effect change, and finally register their disgust at the way incompetent elites protect each other. The elites of Big Business, Big Media, Wall Street, and Washington are terrified of this, and will leverage any censorship power to keep the outsiders at bay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Real “Big Lie”</strong></p><p>After the storming of the Capitol building on Jan. 6, we heard a lot about the “Big Lie” perpetrated by Trump and his allies that the election was “stolen.” In reality, this narrative never got far. It was rejected by the media (including Fox News), thrown out by the courts, labeled by social networks as “disputed,” and dismissed by politicians, including Trump’s own vice president. Yes, some far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers came to Washington to commit acts of violence, but they were roundly denounced. For a Big Lie to be successful, it has to have buy-in from the people in power, moneyed interests, the narrative-framers in the media generally, all of whom have to benefit from the lie and therefore repeat it.&nbsp;</p><p>But what issue could possibly unite all of these constituencies? For several years, elites in the media, government, and now finance have denounced social media as a tool for propaganda, disinformation and hate. Social media was to blame for the Russian disinformation that supposedly elected Trump in 2016. Social media was fingered as the main culprit in an “insurrection” that attempted to overthrow an election. And now, WallStreetBets is accused …</p></div></div>

            <p>Kubernetes is one the largest and fastest growing open-source projects. Since its inception in 2014, Kubernetes received tens of thousands of contributions from the community, and enhanced by plethora of new tools. But that doesn’t come without its downsides. Namely, every now and then, there’s a tool that doesn’t adhere to Kubernetes core principles, and I think one such tool is <em>Helm</em>.</p>

<p>I have tried for so long to understand why Kubernetes community chooses Helm over the other tools, especially given my experience with a tool that has some similar features to it (as you’ll see later). To finally get some insight, I decided to write this blog post to learn more about Helm and its community.</p>

<p>If you search on Google for Kubernetes principles, you are unlikely to find <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/principles.md">this document</a>. While the principles outlined are very succinct, most of Kubernetes developers could probably talk about each of these ideas at length. One such <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuIQurh_kDk">talk</a>, although probably not exhaustive, comes from <a href="https://github.com/saad-ali">Saad Ali</a> at KubeCon. If you’re not deeply familiar with Kubernetes, I highly suggest to give it a listen before you read the rest of the text. Now without delaying any further, here are the principles mentioned in the talk, and why I think Helm breaks <em>some</em> of these principles<em>.</em></p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kubernetes APIs are declarative rather than imperative.</li>
<li>The Kubernetes control plane is transparent. There are no hidden internal APIs.</li>
<li>Meet the user where they are.</li>
<li>Workload portability.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the very first examples mentioned in the talk is about the downsides of client-side. Many of the same problems presented for scripting on the cluster is introduced by Helm as well. What if your machine dies? What if you lose connection? What if your colleague runs the same command at the same time? But also, what if you run a wrong version of Helm? The answer is - you’re possibly going to be in an inconsistent state between two versions. The underlying cause of it is that Helm workflow is imperative, and not declarative. As opposed to using kubectl + Kustomize, for example, whose joint job is to declare the new state of the Kubernetes cluster, Helm can be used to manage the lifecycle of the objects, and apply them in certain order - most notably with hooks.</p>

<p>When I mentioned lifecycle, I immediately thought of only one thing - Kubernetes control plane. As you’ll see in the related talk, it’s quite clear that only lifecycle managers should be <em>controllers</em>, and they should run inside the cluster itself. Strong push for server-side is most evident in recently introduced <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/">Server Side Apply (SSA)</a>, which is trying to fix some of the issues with kubectl by removing one of the last pieces of code that are running client-side.</p>



<p>One of my favourite features of Kubernetes is its transparency. Everything goes through a single endpoint, and everything is available to all parties (with right access permissions). This means that I can start using new piece of software for Kubernetes and inspect what it’s doing to the cluster. That’s why when I think about working with Kubernetes, I mostly think about using kubectl.</p>

<p>With Helm, this is rather different. It is actively trying to hide what it’s doing by providing abstractions between you and the actual state of the cluster. This comes in two forms - CLI and Charts. The former creates new concepts of working with the cluster, that are not consistent with declarative intent of Kubernetes project. Instead of declaring the state of the cluster, it introduces additional <em>commands</em> to describe <em>how</em> to get to desired state of the cluster, also further violating the first principle. More importantly, both hide the information about what Kubernetes objects are being changed on the cluster. Charts especially encourage users to ignore underlying Kubernetes objects by providing additional parameterization abstraction over them. This inevitably ends up being restrictive for end users who want to change fields that are not parametrized by Helm and thus cannot be changed without creating your own copy of the Chart.</p>



<p>One of the early problems of Kubernetes was that its API was pretty verbose and static. Since Kubernetes didn’t meet users with any solution at that time, it prompted many of them (including me) to try something different other than using pure kubectl &amp; YAML. Roughly four years ago, at the time when I was first faced with this problem, I was just at the start of my journey with Ansible. Having not too much experience with Kubernetes, and seeing how much Ansible is flexible and given that it already had the support for interfacing with Kubernetes, I decided to give Ansible and its Jinja templating a try. Things didn’t work out so great.</p>

<p>A year later, I learned about Helm which aimed to solve this same (and more). The trouble is, to me it looked exactly like Jinja. It used a similar structure-unaware templating engine to generate structured data. Most notably, the engine is partially unaware of indents needed to create YAML structures. So, in order to make generated document properly indented, you need to resort to ugly hacks like <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/d792245e710ef759578bbbe956ec1e01efc27af4/stable/airflow/templates/webserver/webserver-deployment.yaml#L193">explicitly specifying number of indents</a> or <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/d792245e710ef759578bbbe956ec1e01efc27af4/stable/airflow/templates/webserver/webserver-deployment.yaml#L220">prefixing blocks with whitespace truncation</a>. And this really felt like trying to put Legos together with glue, all the while being blindfolded. Since then, Helm was supposed to get Lua support which would address the drawbacks of using a general purpose templating engine, but it hasn’t happened yet. Even if it did at some point, bringing Lua as addition only, without deprecating the current templating engine, won’t solve the original problem.</p>

<p>Everything about Helm seems to me like an “obvious solution” (as Saad Ali put it) to the problem of deploying workloads on Kubernetes. Just like my first approach, it gave <em>an</em> answer to “What” to do about this problem, but not the “Why” it’s done that way. The currently used Go templating engine, used to generate Helm manifests, could’ve easily been Jinja, if the project was started in Python. Or even simpler, it could’ve been Python itself with no extra libraries to generate structured YAML outputs from dicts.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there seems to be much better tools for composing pieces of structured data. <a href="https://kustomize.io/">Kustomize</a>, <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">jsonnet</a>, <a href="https://cuelang.org/">CUE</a>, <a href="https://carvel.dev/ytt/">ytt</a>, <a href="https://dhall-lang.org/">Dhall</a> are just some of the tools that are simply better fitted for the job. Similar goes for managing the lifecycle of the applications. Kubernetes, for example, has built-in controllers for managing deployments and statefulsets. These might not fit your use-case, and you certainly don’t have to agree with how they are implemented, but you’re entirely free to build your own <a href="https://book.kubebuilder.io/">controller</a>/<a href="https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/">operator</a> to manage lifecycle of your apps in a different way. However, Helm has chosen to stay client side. Something that’s increasingly moved away from, and most obvious with the addition of SSA.</p>

<h2 id="meeting-long-time-kubernetes-users-the-other-way">Meeting long-time Kubernetes users the other way</h2>

<p>On a similar topic, whilst Kubernetes tried its best to build the tools in place to make the new users feel welcome, Helm did not seem to bother trying to apply the same principle for existing Kubernetes users. I previously mentioned how Helm binary is trying to replace kubectl. As a long time Kubernetes user and operator, I really (and I mean <em>reallyyyyyy…</em>) have gotten used to be able to view transparent APIs through the single lens of kubectl to debug and solve issues. Helm instead takes this power away from you, and fragments the ecosystem.</p>



<p>To get a sense whether the Helm project is at least going in the right direction of correcting some of the design flaws I mentioned above, I looked at some of the new features they’re adding. Two of them are chart values validation, and a post renderer. While you might argue that both of these features are very useful (and I wouldn’t dare to deny that), both of them seem to be breaking either the Kubernetes design or engineering principles.</p>

<h2 id="post-renderer">Post-renderer</h2>

<p>The post-renderer comes as a solution to the problem that Helm itself introduced. Helm charts that are published are not fully customisable by the users. This is because Helm broke one of the key ideas of Kubernetes and decided to hide and abstract Kubernetes objects away from the users. To solve this issue, the Helm project introduced <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering">post-rendering feature</a>. While I was initially excited about the idea of Helm embracing configuration engines other than Go templating (such as Kustomize, which is explicitly mentioned in the docs), the feature still doesn’t fully adhere to some of the same core ideas of the Kubernetes project. Specifically speaking, post-rendering is not a declarative feature. You cannot specify in code that a post-render must be used to install a particular Helm chart. Rather, it relies on manually specifying the correct flag on issuing the helm command, and thus breaks declarative intent of configuration management.</p>

<p>​​It’s even more important to note that this feature goes directly against the core idea of Helm - abstraction. If you want to use post-rendering, you probably need to be intimately familiar with the templates of the upstream Chart. Even though such move is welcome to a certain extent, Helm design clearly continues to prioritize abstraction over transparent APIs and additionally introduces some very puzzling and contradictory design.</p>

<h2 id="chart-values-validation">Chart values validation</h2>

<p>One of the most prominent features of Helm Charts is the ability to abstract away configuration of Kubernetes objects and instead give the user the ability to provide high-level settings they would like to set for their installation of the particular Chart. These high-level settings are configured in the shape of a free-form YAML document. Unfortunately, free-form YAML is not exactly best suited for providing parameters with predefined structure. If you want to change anything about your deployment, the usual way to do so is to look up the default values (present in the Helm Chart), and then specify overrides for what you want to change. But default values are not …</p></div></div>

        <p>BASIC programs often contain machine code routines but they take up quite a lot of space in BASIC.  An interesting way to reduce the amount of space that they take is to store the machine code in <code>REM</code> statements.  This is much more compact and also means that we can call the routine directly from the location it is stored in memory rather than having to copy it to a further location.  This doesn't just apply to machine code, we could also do this for storing other data such as a custom character set.</p>
<h2>How BASIC is Stored in Memory</h2>
<p>A BASIC program consists of a series of BASIC lines followed by two 00 octets to signify the end of the program. The BASIC statements are condensed using tokens such as $8F for <code>REM</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/vic20_basic_lines_memory_layout.png" title="Layout of BASIC lines in memory"></p><h2>Storing Machine Code in DATA Statements</h2>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/vic20_machine_code_in_data_statements_basic_listing.png" title="BASIC listing with machine in DATA statements"></p><p>A machine code routine in BASIC is often stored in <code>DATA</code> statements and then copied to another area of memory for execution.  However, this uses up more memory than storing the routine in <code>REM</code> statements as we will see later.</p>
<p>The following BASIC program copies a machine code routine stored in <code>DATA</code> statements into locations 673-692.  The machine language routine we're using cycles the screen border and background colours and is from the article: <a href="https://techtinkering.com/articles/hand-assembling-to-machine-code-on-the-commodore-vic-20/">Hand Assembling to Machine Code on the Commodore VIC-20</a>.</p>
<pre><code>10 FORA=673TO692:READB:POKEA,B:NEXTA
20 DATA173,15,144,162,255,142,15,144,160,255
30 DATA136,208,253,202,208,245,141,15,144,96
40 SYS673
</code></pre>
<h2>Storing Machine Code in REM Statements</h2>
<p>The machine code routine stored in <code>DATA</code> statements above is position independent and is represented by the following octets which we can also see in the table below.</p>
<pre><code>AD 0F 90 A2 FF
8E 0F 90 A0 FF
88 D0 FD CA D0
F5 8D 0F 90 60
</code></pre>
<p>On an unexpanded Vic, BASIC programs start at $1001 (4097).  We would use a different location for Vics with more memory.  To create a <code>REM</code> statement with the above machine code we would enter the following in memory.  We could easily <code>POKE</code> the values from BASIC into memory starting at location 4097 ($1001) or we could use a simple hex loader or a machine language monitor.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Location</th><th>Octets</th><th>Explanation</th></tr>
  <tr><td>$1001</td><td>1C 10</td><td>Next line link.  Here this is also the end of BASIC program - $101C</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$1003</td><td>0A 00</td><td>Line number - 10</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$1005</td><td>8F</td><td>REM token</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$1006</td><td>20</td><td>Space character</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$1007</td>
    <td>AD 0F 90 A2 FF 8E 0F 90 A0 FF 88 D0 FD CA D0 F5 8D 0F 90 60</td>
    <td>Machine language routine</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>$101B</td><td>00</td><td>End of BASIC line</td></tr>
  <tr><td>$101C</td><td>00 00</td><td>End of BASIC program</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>After we have entered the line into memory we must remember to update locations 45/46 to indicate the end of our BASIC program and the start of variables.</p>
<br>
<h3>Using VICMON to Create REM Statement Containing Machine Code</h3>
<p><img src="https://techtinkering.com/img/articles/vic20_vicmon_code_in_rem_basic_listing.png" title="BASIC listing with machine embedded in REM statement, entered using VICMON"></p><p>If we have a machine language monitor, such as VICMON, then the process is really easy.  We just alter the bytes in memory, exit to BASIC, update the end of BASIC program pointer and then enter our <code>SYS</code> statement on the following line.</p>

<p>In VICMON we first have to enable a virtual zero page otherwise the monitor would overwrite bytes in memory necessary for BASIC.</p>
<pre><code>.E 1200
</code></pre>
<p>Enter BASIC <code>REM</code> lines containing machine code at location $1001 (4097), the start of BASIC on an unexpanded Vic.</p>
<pre><code>.M 1001
.:1001 1C 10 0A 00 8F
.:1006 20 AD 0F 90 A2
.:100B FF 8E 0F 90 A0
.:1010 FF 88 D0 FD CA
.:1015 D0 F5 8D 0F 90
.:101A 60 00 00 00
</code></pre>
<p>Exit to BASIC.</p>
<pre><code>.X
</code></pre>
<p>Move the pointer to end of BASIC program, which is the next location after the end of the BASIC program marker.  This is stored in LSB MSB order and here is $101E (4126).</p>
<pre><code>POKE 45, 30
POKE 46, 16
</code></pre>
<p>Add line to jump to the machine code contained in the <code>REM</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code>20 SYS4103
</code></pre>
<h2>Memory Use Comparison</h2>
<p>The following BASIC statement shows how much memory is free for BASIC programs.</p>
<pre><code>PRINT FRE(0)
</code></pre>
<p>On an unexpanded Vic, that has just been switched on, it shows 3581 bytes free.</p>
<p>The following table shows how much memory is used by the two programs above.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr><th>Program Version</th><th>Memory free (bytes)</th><th>Usage (bytes)</th></tr>
  <tr><td>DATA statements</td><td>3460</td><td>121</td></tr>
  <tr><td>REM statement</td><td>3544</td><td>37</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>We can see from this table that the version of the program that stored the machine code routine in a <code>REM</code> statement used 84 bytes less memory than the one that stored the routine in <code>DATA</code> statements.  It also saved using up memory at 673-692 which could possibly be used for something else.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This method is a great way to save memory in BASIC programs, however it isn't without its problems.  The machine code routine can't contain a <code>00</code> byte as this indicates the end of the BASIC line.  It isn't suitable for listings and it is a pain if we want to alter the machine code stored in the <code>REM</code> statements.  Despite this, it is an interesting method which gives us some incite into how BASIC is stored in memory and can be useful in certain situations.</p>
<h2>Video</h2>
<p>The following video shows a machine code routine being entered into both <code>DATA</code> statements and <code>REM</code> statements.  It also shows the code being run directly from the area in memory where it is embedded within the <code>REM</code> statement.</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One question I'm often asked is what metadata <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow">Matrix</a> leaks. It does get tiring answering the same questions, so I'm creating an article I can simply link to any time someone asks.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am on record many times saying Matrix leaks metadata. However, one thing that many people fail to understand is exactly what Matrix leaks, and why.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> For the purposes of this article, it's assumed users are communicating using end-to-end encryption (E2EE). In non-E2EE rooms, you can expect everything mentioned here to be leaked, as well as actual message contents.</em></p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-metadata-leak">What is a metadata leak?</h3>

<p>Metadata leaks are when your messaging app includes <a href="https://ia801306.us.archive.org/28/items/content-metadata-matrix/content-metadata-matrix_text.pdf" rel="nofollow">metadata</a> in a way that's not encrypted end-to-end. This includes the dates and times you send messages, who you send them to, how frequently you send messages, and more. Many messengers allow you to set status messages and profile pictures. These are not encrypted, and are thus leaked. The issue with metadata leaks is they can fairly easily <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/your-phone-metadata-is-more-revealing-than-you-think" rel="nofollow">reveal sensitive information</a>, even when you don't expect them to.</p>

<h3 id="what-metadata-does-matrix-leak">What metadata does Matrix leak?</h3>

<p>Matrix supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This protects the contents of messages, such that nobody can read them except the intended recipients. E2EE can be enabled manually in Matrix rooms, but is also enabled by default in 1:1 chats (DMs). Some clients may not enable E2EE by default,  so you should always verify whether messages are sent E2EE.</p>

<p>Matrix's E2EE does not, however, encrypt everything. The following information is not encrypted:</p>
<ul><li>Message senders
<ul><li>Message senders are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Session/device IDs
<ul><li>Due to Matrix's design, encrypting this would break verification</li></ul></li>
<li>Message timestamps
<ul><li>It's impossible to prevent timestamps from leaking, since the server can simply note when an event is received anyway</li></ul></li>
<li>Room members (join/leave/invite events)
<ul><li>Join/leave/invite and other room events are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Message edit events
<ul><li>While contents are not leaked, an attacker can know when messages are edited</li></ul></li>
<li>Message reactions
<ul><li>Reactions are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Read receipts
<ul><li>Read receipts are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Nicknames
<ul><li>Nicknames are never encrypted</li></ul></li>
<li>Profile pictures
<ul><li>Profile pictures are never encrypted</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>To demonstrate some examples of these leaks, I have made some examples available: <a href="https://snippets.serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix-metadata-leaks" rel="nofollow">https://snippets.serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix-metadata-leaks</a></p>

<h3 id="who-can-view-metadata">Who can view metadata?</h3>

<p>The following metadata can be seen by any homeserver with at least 1 member in an E2EE room:</p>
<ul><li>Message senders</li>
<li>Session/device IDs</li>
<li>Message timestamps</li>
<li>Room members (join/leave/invite events)</li>
<li>Message edit events</li>
<li>Message reactions</li>
<li>Read receipts</li>
<li>Room-specific nicknames</li>
<li>Room-specific profile pictures</li></ul>

<p>The following information is publicly available:</p>
<ul><li>Global nicknames
<ul><li>Matrix allows setting room-specific nicknames, which are less visible to attackers</li></ul></li>
<li>Profile pictures
<ul><li>Matrix allows setting room-specific profile pictures, which are less visible to attackers</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
<ul><li>A room has 2 members, both from <em>homeserver1.example.com</em>. Any attacker with access to <em>homeserver1.example.com</em> can see metadata from that room. This includes homeserver admins, as well as anyone who manages to compromise the homeserver.</li>
<li>A room has 2 members, one from <em>homeserver1.example.com</em>, and another from <em>homeserver2.example.com</em>. Any attacker with access to <em>homeserver1.example.com</em> or <em>homeserver2.example.com</em> can see metadata from that room. This includes homeserver admins, as well as anyone who manages to compromise one (or more) of the homeservers.</li>
<li>I think you get the idea...</li></ul>

<h3 id="why-does-matrix-leak-metadata">Why does Matrix leak metadata?</h3>

<p>Federated networks are naturally more vulnerable to metadata leaks than P2P or centralized networks. These leaks can be fixed, at the expense of increased complexity of the protocol (thus making it more vulnerable to faulty implementations). Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is necessary for proper functioning of the protocol.</p>

<p>Some metadata must be leaked due to features Matrix provides. For example, Matrix's message verification requires knowing which user and device sent a message (to know which key to verify with). In other cases (such as global profile pictures and nicknames), the information is considered public anyway, and therefore has no need to be encrypted. Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is a triviality.</p>

<p>Some metadata leaks are accepted for performance requirements. For example, message reactions and read receipts might not be encrypted because Matrix's E2EE is slower than normal (non-E2EE) messaging. Encrypting reactions and read receipts could provide a painful user experience (UX). Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is a design feature.</p>

<p>Some metadata leaks are simply a matter of the protocol's failure to consider them. For example, room-specific nicknames, room-specific profile pictures, and message edit events could all be encrypted without breaking the protocol. Matrix's failure to prevent these leaks is a design flaw.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Though edit events are leaked, message contents are not.</p>

After recovering from his poisoning in Germany, Navalny returned to Russia only to be arrested and imprisoned in Moscow.

When David and I prepared to launch Wilbur Labs in 2016, the startup studio model was still developing. There wasnâ€™t a standard approach, and the business model was unproven.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We had to rethink how companies should be built. We knew that the vast majority of startups fail, and that money alone canâ€™t build big businesses. As a result, we operate very differently from other investors, incubators, or accelerators in existence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We believe that organizational knowledge, or what we call studio knowledge, is far more valuable than capital. Each time we research an idea, solve a problem, launch a company, and learn from our successes and failures, we build on our studio knowledge. Studio knowledge collects, compounds, and carries through to all current and future portfolio companies. This uniquely allows our portfolio companies to move faster and further than is possible when raising capital through traditional sources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We also realized that while many investors claim to provide operational support, in reality, this support is mostly limited to high-level advice. When building a startup, execution is everything. We needed to be on the ground floor to effectively help our portfolio companies build and grow. Whether itâ€™s setting up payroll, building a team, maintaining compliance, setting a product roadmap, or acquiring customers, our studio team of entrepreneurs has done this before, bringing battle-tested processes and learnings every step of the way. The end result is a better foundation for growth and fewer distractions for our portfolio company leadership teams, which can focus singularly on building great products for customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Three attributes differentiate Wilbur Labs from other investors or methods of building a company: our focus on building companies, providing shared resources across our portfolio to scale at an accelerated pace, and our operational involvement to help each business take off.<br></p></div><h2>A Company That Builds Companies</h2><div><p dir="ltr">Wilbur Labs focuses on turning bold ideas into market-leading companies. While we also invest and acquire existing companies, building from 0 to 1 is our core focus. Launching a startup is typically a one-time event, but at Wilbur Labs, <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-get-startup-ideas">generating startup ideas</a>, then <a href="https://www.wilburlabs.com/blueprints/how-to-turn-an-idea-into-a-business">turning those ideas into a business</a>, is a repeatable and standardized process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We identify big customer pain points and build businesses to solve these problems. After an idea is validated in the Lab, we bring in industry leaders with domain expertise to manage and grow the company. Wilbur Labs continues to provide funding, shared resources, and operational support to ensure management is focused on solving problems that matter.</p></div><h2>Shared Resources</h2><div><p dir="ltr">We have shared resources that allow for more rapid development and faster progression through the idea, launch, and growth stage. From playbooks to shared teams, processes, and infrastructure, these resources allow our companies to move faster than traditional companies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Distractions and lack of focus are responsible for killing many startups. At Wilbur Labs, we reduce time spent on non-core tasks by giving our companies access to shared resources, advisors, and domain experts. That way, the founding team can focus on solving core user and business problems.<br></p>
</div><h2>Operational Involvement</h2><div><p dir="ltr">Wilbur Labs is more operationally involved, especially early on, compared to accelerators or venture capital firms. We believe in â€œmore wood behind fewer arrows,â€� meaning we build fewer companies with more resources behind each one. By leaning on the experience and repeatable processes of our studio team â€” which launches multiple companies every year â€” weâ€™re able to reduce risk and expedite growth.</p>
<div dir="ltr"><p>Over the years, as others have seen our companies grow at a rapid pace, we have commonly fielded the question, â€œwhat is your secret sauce?â€� The truth is that we focus on solving big problems better, and by doing so, our companies grow. No matter how far you dig into that question, you will never find a single secret sauce, piece of technology, strategy, playbook, tool, or person responsible for what we do best. Instead, digging further into that question will uncover our studio knowledge: 1,000+ processes, plans, decisions, people, playbooks, approaches, technologies, checklists, roadmaps, learnings, and values. Together, this studio knowledge allows us to solve bigger problems, faster, with reduced risk than would otherwise be possible.</p><p>We believe that dedicated, standalone teams are necessary to solve big problems over a long period of time.

<p>According to his last tweet, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is now enjoying his Twitter holiday for a while. But before his temporary leave, he dropped an interesting bit about Tesla Gigafactory Berlin, “It will be filled with graffiti art,” he responded to his own drone video of the factory construction progress.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can expect anything from <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>‘s wildly imaginative mind. Looks like this idea is not too odd coming from the Meme Lord himself, who also happens to be the owner of stankmemes.com — just awesome!</p>

<p>Using my Photoshop ninjitsu I overlayed a graffiti photo above the roof of Gigafactory Berlin and it does look kind of cool. However, it is not clear from Elon Musk’s short tweet if the entire factory will be painted with graffiti art or just the selected portions of the huge manufacturing structure will be filled.</p>

<p>Usually, a large area of a Gigafactory roof is reserved for solar panels to absorb vast amounts of energy that the Sun provides us for free and without polluting our environment. The initial <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-berlin/">Gigafactory Berlin</a> render posted by Tesla also shows a large number of solar panels on its roof. However, there are blank spaces on the roof as well, perfect for painting some Giga Graffiti art.</p>

<p>Snowfall at the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg has covered the entire factory roof and land for a while now. This has made the factory look whiter than ever. Tobias Lindh, a local Giga Berlin observer has covered this in his latest drone photos and video from this past weekend.</p>



<p>Tesla’s next US <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/giga-austin/">Gigafactory in Austin, Texas</a> also received a rare snowfall around the Christmas days, <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/01/11/under-construction-giga-texas-looks-majestic-on-a-snowy-day-drone-video/">captured in a drone video</a>.</p>

<p>Tesla has been constantly hiring engineers and related staff for Giga Berlin. Just before last Christmas, the automaker posted an interesting <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2020/12/24/tesla-gives-a-sneak-preview-of-4680-cell-production-at-giga-berlin-in-the-latest-video/">video showcasing the future 4680 cell production</a> at Giga Berlin asking engineers to apply for related jobs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p>The other day somebody on reddit asked the age-old question: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/fsharp/comments/la1mz5/a_simple_question/">why didn't F# have typeclasses or functors?</a></p><p>That's a long discussion, but while reading replies, somebody mentioned this cool litte <a href="https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpPlus">F#+ library.</a></p><p>Over to GitHub we go!</p><p>Over the years, as I've written more and more solutions in F#, I've come across stuff I wanted to do where it seemed as if I were fighting the language too much. Stuff like common conversions with strings. Turns out a lot of other people have those issues also, so folks started collecting little goodies here and there. You're coding along, and suddenly you realize you want to make sure that string is all lower case. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a method to automatically do that, something like "foo".toLower()?</p><p>As most every coder knows, that's already don. It's in there. But it's not just that one little method. During regular coding you run across all kinds of stuff that hasn't been coded. Let's say you want to put hyphens in a string (why, I don't know)</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Extensions
    let allCapsString = "I LIKE HYPHENS!"
    printfn "Extensions to core types"
    printfn "Original"
    printfn "%s" allCapsString
    let stickSomeHyphensInThere =  String.intersperse '-'
    printfn "Fixed"
    printfn "%s" (stickSomeHyphensInThere allCapsString)
    ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's trivial stuff, but damn stuff like that gets old. And it's not just trivial stuff. Let's you've got a list and you're expecting only one element in it. Lots of business logic revolves around making sure you have one and only one thing. How about this?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    let singletonTestData1=[1]
    let singletonTestData2=[]
    // reuturns the value or throws an error
    let singletonRet1=List.exactlyOne singletonTestData1
    // returns the value or none
    let singletonRet2:Option&lt;int&gt;=
        Option.protect List.exactlyOne singletonTestData2
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's pretty nifty because you can make sure it's only one item (or throw an error), catch the error and deal with it later (not shown here), or bail out on any decision-making entirely and let somebody else worry about it, ie, use an option.</p><p>I imagine we could do the same with atLeastOne. In fact, I might code that up as a PR. That's also a very common business requirement.</p><p>And you can extend generics too. How many times have you written a function and wanted to use it later as an operator? That kinda thing is fairly common in C++, and you can certainly do it in NET, but many times to get it done it seems unnecessarily complicated. How about this?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>
    // turn any function into an operator
    let smallerThan a b=a &lt; b
    // isSmaller = true
    let isSmaller = 10 &lt;/smallerThan/&gt; 20
    ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I'm not crazy about that syntax, but fooling around with it some, I can see where the FSharpPlus guys were coming from. There are some odd language issues at stake, and this looks like a good compromise. I think this works better than some of the other options.</p><p>Once again, none of this is rocket science. All along you could have made this happen in whatever .NET language you use. It's nice having it already in there. Thanks guys!</p><p>I saw this one and almost had a nerdgasm. Every now and then you'll have a string and want to convert it to bytes, perhaps for some low-level fun with bits. Ever try to do that from scratch? Wow, it's a pain. There are excellent reasons it's a pain: there's encoding, there's collation rules, the list goes on and on. Human languages are tough. But what about just a dang default? Try this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Generic operators
    // Whatever I've got, make it bytes
    let myBufferBytes =
        "This is something I need to do bit-level stuff with" |&gt; toBytes
        ```</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Because that's a type extension on a generic, that works with all types of stuff. Just throw whatever you've got to toBytes and move on.</p><p>You can do this on your own, but you'll kill precious development time (and focus) wading through docs. And if you only do it one or two times a year it'll be that same pain, over and over again.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>    // Need to splay out a bunch of processing and then sum when done?
    let res42 = map ((+) 21) (async {return 21})
    let myComputationallyHardAnswer = extract res42
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Here we've wrapped up some common threading stuff along with collection traversal.</p><p>Of course, it's all composable with all of the other tools you have.</p><p>In another post I'll do some of the other cool stuff, like all of the mondad things they have, &nbsp;but that really gets into the technical part of coding itself instead of the convenience provided here.

<p>Revolut customers in Europe received this email around 4.54PM CET.</p>
<h2>Trading Update for GME &amp; AMC</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Hi …,</p>
<p>From today, we will only be able to facilitate the selling of GameStop (NYSE: <strong>GME</strong>) and AMC Entertainment (NYSE: <strong>AMC</strong>) stocks for the time being. Unfortunately, our broker-dealer in the US, DriveWealth, can no longer offer Buys on these stocks due to increased capital requirements set by the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for me?</h3>
<p>You can only sell out your existing holdings in these stocks. Any outstanding buy orders on these two symbols made after Monday’s (1 February) close will automatically be cancelled prior to market open on February 2 2021.</p>
<p>None of our other stocks are affected at this time and are available to trade as normal.</p>
<p>For customers with no holdings in these 2 stocks, neither GME, nor AMC will appear when searched. This is a standard practice when a position moves to sell only, as we don’t want to show you stocks you’re not able to buy at that time. As soon as they become available to buy again, you’ll be able to see them in the app.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>Why is this happening?</h3>
<p>When a stock is traded, it takes two days for the proceeds to go from the broker to the clearing house. This is known as T+2 settlement. Within this time, the clearing house requires the broker to front cash or capital guarantees to ensure funds are available through the settlement process.</p>
<p>The required amount of capital is usually around 10-15% of the value of a security’s holdings on broker’s books. However, this percentage can vary based on stock volatility. In the case of GME and AMC, the DTC has enforced an increase of capital requirements by 250% upon DriveWealth’s clearing partners.</p>
<p>This increase means that DriveWealth is now obligated to restrict trading in GME and AMC, as each stock has its own capital requirement rather than a broker wide requirement.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>When will they be available again to buy?</h3>
<p>This is not a decision Revolut has made, simply one that we are obligated to carry out. We are monitoring the situation very closely and will update you when our partner, DriveWealth, re-enables Buys for GME and AMC. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>Team Revolut</p>

<p><strong>Capital at Risk</strong></p>
<p>The value of a stock may fall as well as rise and you may get back less than what you initially paid, and in some cases the stock may lose its entire value and you may lose your initial investment. This is not investment advice. It is strongly recommended that you seek professional investment advice before making any investment decision.</p>

<p>Revolut is one of the most popular investing apps in Europe. Maybe it is not that well-known in US yet.</p>
<p>But, until recently, it was one of possible alternatives to Robinhood to buy $GME and $AMC stocks.<br>

What are alternatives to Revolut in Europe – to buy $GME and $AMC stocks?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://invezz.com/news/2021/02/02/revolut-competitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invezz</a>, you can still buy these stocks in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saxo</li>
<li>BlackBull markets</li>
<li>AvaTrade</li>

Typically your computer makes a request for some information and the server responds:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Your computer:</strong> Yo, what's good about this random site learnreact.design?</p><p><strong>The server:</strong> Hang on, let me grab something for you. Beep. Boop.</p></blockquote><p>The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p><p>HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure. How many headings and paragraphs are there? What images should a user see? Are this button and that textbox contained in the same box?</p><p>Using this information, the browser creates something called... the DOM!</p><div><p><img alt="Introducing the DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Wait a second, the DOM is a ... tree? Yup, a tree! Oddly enough, a lot of things in our computer look like a tree. Let's give our tree friend a nickname... hmm what about Domo?</p><p>Domo works as a model at the prestigious art studio "Web Browser". His job is to pose in front of the artist who paints a portrait (or perhaps millions of portraits).</p><div><p><img alt="Domo at the art studio Web Browser" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>In real life, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's indeed a model -- a model of the document (aka the web page). It strikes a pose. The browser paints a portrait. The portraits are what we see on a web page: the textboxes, the paragraphs, the images and so on. A developer's job is like that of a director who tells Domo what to wear and what pose to strike. This determines what those portraits look like in the end.</p><p>To check out what the DOM looks like, if you are using a desktop browser, right-click on this very page and choose "Inspect".

Instead of mostly static web <em>pages</em>, they want web <em>apps</em> that are interactive, fast and responsive.</p><p>The code required to build web apps becomes increasingly large and complex.

It's built in a way that we no longer need to directly work with the DOM API in most cases.

The core idea is based on a simple strategy: divide-and-conquer. If it's difficult to grok a problem all at once, we break it into smaller problems, solve them one at a time and then combine the results.</p><div><p><img alt="React breaks a problem into components" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Building an app in React is almost all about working with components: breaking the app into components, finding the best components for the job, fitting one with another, creating new components from existing ones etc.</p><p>Nowadays, design tools such as Framer and Figma have components too (and symbols in Sketch). They are a lot like React components, except that the latter are more flexible and powerful. In fact, the inspiration of components in design tools came directly from components in software engineering. Once a component is created, we can create multiple instances of it. We can use it to construct other components. If we change a component, everything that includes this component will be updated automatically.</p><p>Components in React have two important properties:</p><ol><li>Components are <em>composable</em>. They are made for reuse. We can make a new component with other components.</li><li>Components are <em>independent</em> of each other. If we change the code in one place, other parts don't break.</li></ol><p>If this sounds abstract to you, don't worry! I'll show you some examples and explain these properties in details soon.</p><h3><a id="declarative-ui" href="#declarative-ui"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Declarative UI</a></h3><h4><a id="imperative-vs-declarative" href="#imperative-vs-declarative"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Imperative vs. declarative</a></h4><p>When directly working with the DOM API, we'd have to specify what element to change at the right time, in the right order. This is equivalent to describing to Domo how to position his head, arms and legs step by step, for each and every portrait.</p><div><p><img alt="Imperative programming" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Heck, this sounds tedious and error-prone! Why can't we just tell Domo <em>what</em> we want instead of <em>how</em> to pose? In fact, this is exactly how to build a UI in React. A developer draws a quick sketch of what he or she wants. React explains it to Domo how to pose.</p><div><p><img alt="Declarative programming in React" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>Because the apps we build are dynamic, we often want Domo to change poses fairly quickly. We draw many sketches and hand them to React in a big pile. React stacks these sketches together and flips them like a flipbook. A dynamic UI comes live!</p><div><p><img alt="React treats input as a flipbook" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>In tech terms, if the code defines <em>how</em> we want it to be done, it's <strong>imperative</strong>; if it defines <em>what</em> we want, it's <strong>declarative</strong>. The traditional way of directly working with the DOM API is imperative, and the React way is declarative.</p><p>Imperative programming emerged from the day when the computers were primitive. People had to instruct them in detail: where to store the numbers, how to multiply etc. But this eventually got unmanageable, people wrote smart software that convert definition of problems into detailed instructions. Declarative programming was born.</p><h4><a id="virtual-dom" href="#virtual-dom"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Virtual DOM</a></h4><p>Besides making the life of a developer easier, declarative programming in React also offers opportunities for performance optimization.</p><p>When React has all the sketches beforehand, he can sort through them, remove any duplication and make sure that Domo and the artist do as little work as possible.</p><div><p><img alt="React diffing with virtual DOM" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>These sketches are called <em>Virtual DOM</em>. Virtual DOM is much faster to manipulate than the DOM. Developers work with Virtual DOM most of the time instead of directly managing the DOM. React handles the dirty work of managing the slow DOM.</p><h3><a id="reactive-dom-updates" href="#reactive-dom-updates"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" height="20" width="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg>Reactive DOM updates</a></h3><p>Even cooler, imagine if we can leave placeholders in our sketches to represent different variations of a same pose. This way, when somebody asks for portraits of Domo wearing a different hat, we don't have to talk to React again. We can just sit back and let React change it for us.</p><div><p><img alt="Thinker with a hat: Placeholder in JSX" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>This trick is how React got its name. The UI built with React is <strong>reactive</strong> -- it appears that the DOM "reacts" to any changes to the underlying data. No need to track the data. No need to worry about when to update the DOM. It just gets updated automatically (by React). The idea of reactive UI greatly simplifies UI development.</p><div><div><p>Now let's review what we have learned so far and get our hands dirty on a few real React components. To make it easy for you to understand, I left out some details in the code (notedly JavaScript). The goal is to let the core ideas shine through without being bogged down by JS syntax.

    <p>I’ve been trying to read more applied crypto papers here and there, and this
past week, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1491.pdf">Partitioning Oracle Attacks</a>
(Len, Grubbs, Ristenpart) came up on my reading list. This paper presents a new
class of attack against certain cryptographic protocols that are based on
low-entropy secrets (e.g., passwords). It’s a way to dramatically speed up
guessing attacks – for example, in some cases the attack allows the attacker to
binary-search over a dictionary of passwords instead of trying them one-by-one.
This type of attack seems likely to become a classic because it applies to some
well-known encryption schemes and many different applications.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll give a high-level overview of another classic oracle attack
(padding oracles), and compare and contrast to the new concept of partitioning
oracle attacks as I understand them; my goal here is to make these attacks
accessible to people with minimal cryptography background. Then I’ll give one of
my hot takes about PAKEs, which is probably mostly of interest to people who
have read the partitioning oracles paper or similar.</p>

<h2 id="oracles-by-example">Oracles by example</h2>

<p>In cryptography, “oracle” means a black-box function or system that takes an
input and returns an output. In the context of an attack, an oracle is used to
formally model unexpected information leakage that gives the attacker some extra
information. Oracle attacks are interesting and educational because they
illustrate why it’s so important that an encryption of a message reveals <em>no
(efficiently computable) information</em> about the message itself: even seemingly
innocuous extraneous information can be used, surprisingly, to break the
encryption scheme entirely.</p>

<p>Typically, when cryptographers describe an attacker for a cryptosystem, they
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen-plaintext_attack">model</a> the attacker as
having certain capabilities, such as the capability to request encryptions for a
reasonable number of messages of their choice. Then the attacker has a challenge
that they have to solve, such as distinguishing an encryption of another message
of their choice from an encryption of a random message.</p>

<p>But in a real implementation of that cryptosystem, the attacker might learn a
lot more than is modeled in these formal enumerations of their capabilities. The
attacker might be able to observe the time that it takes to encrypt a message,
or might even learn something about the contents of a message from elsewhere in
the system. Oracles are a way to formally describe this type of leakage. For
example, suppose a server decrypts a message and then inserts it into a
database, and the database returns an error in a short-circuit if the message’s
first byte is <code>0x00</code>, and goes on to do some other processing otherwise. An
attacker can learn from observing the timing of this database operation whether
the message starts with <code>0x00</code>. We can model this as an oracle, by saying that
the attacker has the capability to query an oracle function whose output is 1 if
and only the message starts with <code>0x00</code>.</p>

<p>The classic example of an oracle attack is a padding oracle, where the attacker
learns a single extra bit about any arbitrary ciphertext: whether it is padded
correctly. “Padding” here refers to the fact that many encryption schemes don’t
work on messages of arbitrary lengths. For example, it’s common for encryption
algorithms to process messages in blocks of 16 bytes, so messages have to be
padded to a multiple of 16 bytes, with some well-defined and reversible padding
scheme. One example of a padding scheme is to fill in the padding bytes with the
length of the padding. In this scheme, a message of length 60 bytes will be
padded with 4 bytes set to the value <code>0x04</code>, so that the ciphertext is an even
16 x 4 = 64 bytes long.</p>

<p>When implementing cryptographic algorithms, it’s easy to accidentally provide a
padding oracle to attackers. The oracle often comes from a timing side-channel,
because it’s tempting to short-circuit if padding is invalid and not go on to do
other processing that is done for correctly padded messages.</p>

<p>And it’s not too hard to implement a padding oracle attack for many encryption
schemes. I’ll illustrate this with a hypothetical example that demonstrates the
basic concept.</p>

<p>Suppose you have an encryption scheme where flipping a bit in a ciphertext flips
the corresponding bit in the underlying plaintext. So if you encrypt some
message <em>m</em>, flip the last bit in the ciphertext, and then decrypt it, you’ll
get a message which is the same as <em>m</em> but with the last bit flipped. (It might
seem, intuitively, that a secure encryption scheme shouldn’t have this property
that you can transform a ciphertext to produce a predictable transformation in
the plaintext, but this property on its own isn’t actually enough to break the
encryption algorithm. The property is called <em>malleability</em>, and some common
encryption algorithms have it and others don’t.)</p>

<p>Suppose you’re using this encryption scheme with the padding scheme I described
above: messages are padded with <em>n</em> bytes, each set to the value <em>n</em>, to extend
the message length to a multiple of 16 bytes. We’ll say that there’s always at
least one byte of padding added, so a message that is originally 16 bytes would
be padded to 32 bytes.</p>

<p>Now consider an attacker who has some ciphertext which is an encryption of a
message <em>m</em>, and the attacker wants to learn what <em>m</em> is. The attacker can
request decryptions for an arbitrary number of ciphertexts to learn if the
underlying plaintexts have valid padding – this is the padding oracle. Here’s
the attacker’s algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, we need to figure out what the padding value is. The attacker will do
this by searching for how to transform the original message into a message
that has only one byte of padding. The attacker iteratively chooses a byte <em>b</em>
from <code>0x01</code> to <code>0xff</code>, and at each iteration, the attacker xors the last byte
of the ciphertext with <em>b</em> and queries to see if the padding is valid.
(Technically we don’t have to check every possible value of <em>b</em>, because we
know there are only so many possible values of the real underlying padding
byte, but that’s an optimization we can ignore for simplicity.)
    <ul>
      <li>When the attacker finds a value for b that produces valid padding, then
the attacker has learned that the last byte of the message xored with <em>b</em>
is (probably<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>) equal to <code>0x01</code>, which allows them to recover the actual
last byte of the message – the length of the original message’s padding.</li>
      <li>If every possible value of <em>b</em> results in a padding error, then the
attacker knows that the actual padding value is <code>0x01</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Suppose the attacker has now discovered that there are 3 bytes of padding in
the original message, so the last 3 bytes of the message are <code>0x03</code>. The
attacker is now going to search for the value of the 4th-to-last byte of the
message (which is the last byte of the original unpadded message). They’ll do
this by transforming the last 3 bytes of the message from <code>0x03</code> to <code>0x04</code>, and
then searching for how to transform the 4th-to-last byte to <code>0x04</code>:
    <ul>
      <li>To transform the last 3 bytes of the underlying message from <code>0x03</code> to
<code>0x04</code>, the attacker xors the last 3 bytes of the ciphertext with <code>0x07</code>
(because <code>0x03 ⊕ 0x07 = 0x04</code>).</li>
      <li>If at this point the ciphertext produces valid padding, then the attacker
knows that the 4th-to-last byte is <code>0x04</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, now the attacker again iterates from <em>b</em> = <code>0x01</code> to <code>0xff</code> and
xors the 4th-to-last byte of the ciphertext with <em>b</em>. When the attacker
finds a value of <em>b</em> that produces valid padding, they know that the
4th-to-last byte’s value xored with <em>b</em> is (again, probably) <code>0x04</code>, and
from that they can recover that byte’s value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now it’s a simple matter of iterating this procedure for each remaining byte,
from last to first, to recover the entire message!</li>
</ul>

<p>The high-level idea is that if an attacker can transform a ciphertext in a way
that produces a predictable change in the plaintext, they can use this to search
for transformations that produce valid padding. If they know that a transformed
byte of ciphertext produces a valid padding byte in the plaintext, then they
might be able to learn what the original byte of plaintext was by undoing that
transformation.</p>

<h2 id="partitioning-oracles">Partitioning oracles</h2>

<p>Now that I’ve talked so much about padding oracles, you might be a bit peeved to
hear that partitioning oracles are not really like padding oracles at all. I
believe that they both will be classic oracle attacks with significant practical
impact, but that’s mostly where the similarity ends. I mostly explained padding
oracles because they are a relatively straightforward example of what an oracle
is and how it can be used, and because they can help explain partitioning
oracles as a series of contrasts.</p>

<h3 id="attack-target-plaintext-versus-password">Attack target: plaintext versus password</h3>

<p>Whereas a padding oracle attack aims to recover a plaintext from a ciphertext, a
partitioning oracle attack aims to recover the secret key – which is far more
devastating, because it allows the attacker to subsequently decrypt any message.
Padding oracles are relevant to any cryptosystem that uses a padding scheme, but
partitioning oracle attacks specifically target cryptosystems that derive keys
from low-entropy secrets like passwords.</p>

<p>Password-based cryptosystems are inherently weaker than systems where a key is
chosen at random. The space of passwords is usually smaller than the space of
possible keys, and passwords can be chosen weakly, often coming from a large
dictionary of common passwords. Password-based cryptosystems aim to at least
avoid offline brute-force attackers, where an attacker can eavesdrop on some
communication and then try a bunch of different passwords offline. Instead, the
attacker should be forced to interact with the legitimate parties; in the real
world, this is a significant deterrent since the attacker will be subject to
denial-of-service and anti-fraud protections if they have to interact with a
real server, plus the time required to process each guess will be slowed down by
network latency and other factors.</p>

<p>So, the partitioning oracle setting is …</p></div></div>

I’m your host, Dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to Felienne Hermans about how we can learn to program faster, better, and more easily. But before I start, I want to tell you a bit more about ConfigCat – today’s sponsor of this episode. ConfigCat is a feature flag management tool that allows you to seamless and effortless switch features on and off in your application through an intuitive user interface. Everyone on the team, independent of the tech skills, is ready to go within 10 minutes of training to configure the feature set that your user sees based on rules. You can even start to do sophisticated A/B testing, hassle-free and intuitively within a few minutes.</p><p>Super interesting for my listeners doing business within Europe, ConfigCat allows you to have your data distributed in the European Union only so you can easily stay GDPR compliant. So if you want to tap into the sheer possibilities of feature flag management, go have a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://configcat.com/" rel="nofollow">https://configcat.com/</a></p><p>I tried it and I promise you’re up and running within few minutes. Feature flags mean faster deploys with less risks. Less risks is also the generous free plan of ConfigCat. You can start for free today. And with each paid plan, they plant a tree. Cool. Right?</p><p>But now back to Felienne. Felienne is an associate professor at the university of Leiden and investigate how we can best learn how to program Felina is also active in the developer community and organize several developer, meetups, and conferences. She’s a big fan of legal and served for many years as a legal judge at local competitions for kids, her passionate for bringing young kids into TAFE also leads her to being a teacher at the high school in the Netherlands. Currently feeling also writes a book called programmer’s brain explaining what happens in our brain when we learn to code, but also when we read and drive and try to understand code. So I’m super thrilled to have Nina here with me, the unit, what? Come to</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:01:57] Michelle. Thanks for having me.</p><p><span>Michaela:</span>&nbsp;[00:01:59] Yeah, I’m really, really happy. It took quite some time, but now you’re here. And I’m so I’m so curious to learn more about the program is brain, because this is an area that I’m super interested. I mean, we both have been doing the PhD together right. In the same research group, but we were sitting in the same office and I was researching program comprehension. So how are people understanding code. And so this is so close to what really interests me, what really fascinates me. So I’m super thrilled to learn more about that. So can you tell me a little bit about the book, but also your research? Because I think the book is very close to your research that you are doing at university of Leiden,</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:02:38] right? Yeah. That’s correct. And maybe we have to go once. So Beko about what lead me to write this book and what lead me to, to do this research because initially what exactly we were doing your PhD at the same time. And then I wasn’t so interested in program comprehension. I was more interested in developer tools at that time, but then what happened is I started to teach. And then when I started to teach, I realized that. Programming is so hard. I think I sort of forgot because I was already programming for such a long time for myself, that all these parts of programming, like there is so much you have to get, right. If you’re making a program, you have to make a plan in your head. Like this is where I’m going, which requires you to understand the domain, the problem that you’re solving. But at the same time, you also have to be like ridiculously precise. You have to get. Periods and semi-colons and brackets and everything has to fit at so many different levels that when I started to teach kids, it’s like, Oh my God, this is so hard. Why is this so hard? Why is it so hard, for example, for children to remember syntax? Why is it so hard for kids to remember what I was working on there? Sometimes I saw kids was very engaged in a problem, and then I explained something to them. And then a few days later it was like, Oh, I have no recollection of this. And I was like, but I explained this to you, like just a few days ago, how do you not remember? Or I saw them very determined of, Oh, I’m making a game and a cat has to catch fish or something. This is what I’m doing. And then they sorta got sidetracked. And then you, you walk past five minutes later and it was like, Why aren’t you making a game with a cat and it goes like, Oh yeah, that’s true. I totally forgot. He goes, I fell into some hole of a variable or a loop. So that just got me really, really excited to understand more about how do people think, how do people remember things? And of course there was so much research already that wasn’t so connected to programming. This is relatively easy to read all sorts of introduction, books into cognition and cognitive science. But then I realized there wasn’t really a book that explains. Beginner, cognitive science in the context of programming. So then I was like, I could write that book because now I know a lot.</p><p><span>Michaela:</span>&nbsp;[00:04:51] Oh, yeah, very good. And so I actually watched one of your talks. I forgot where it was, but it was really good to talk about programming and understanding program. And you were also talking about kids and when I watched that, and also when I heard you talk right now, I’m wondering, but can we actually generalized from kids to adults? Right. So do we struggled the same way as kids. I struggle. And I definitely do see like this abstraction levels. Right. You have to be very detailed as you said, with the center rugs and semi-colons, or even like tabs and so on. And then you have like this, this larger vision that you have to keep in mind, but do we struggle in the same way or do adults have different problems also compared to</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:05:31] kids? That’s a great question. So in general, adults and kids do learn and struggle at the same level, but that is the case for Morphis adults. So if, if a 10 year old is learning to program and let’s say your next door neighbor is also learning to program, and they’re not a programmer, right. Then they will very much struggle with the same thing. However, if you, if your question is about expert programmers, then they don’t, then they also struggle, but they struggle in different ways. So you already know Java and now you want to learn R then your circle will be different than someone that doesn’t know Java that is learning. Whether that’s a kid or an adult. Okay. Yeah,</p><p><span>Michaela:</span>&nbsp;[00:06:09] I see. And so something else that, that I also thought when, when I heard you talk about all different concepts and you were saying, well, next word known something different than like a novice or, or struggles differently. Like for example, I’m trying to learn new programming languages. Right. And so I, I know Java, I know C-sharp, I know Hiten and a little bit of JavaScript, but. You know, the further it goes away from the languages that I initially learned with her Java and object oriented programming, the more I’m struggling. Right. So I’m struggling, I think, because I have all these preconceived ideas, mental models notions off, you know, what’s right. And what’s wrong, how to do that. And then sometimes I feel like. Oh, this doesn’t work so well now in PI 10, right there, maybe this is not that I’m not meant to do it that way. Right. And so how can, how can people that already know language? How can they overcome those things are some techniques that we can employ, right. To get better at learning new languages. Yeah,</p><p><span>Felienne:</span>&nbsp;[00:07:08] definitely. So one of the things that I talk about in my book is the concept of transfer. So transfer is you already know something about domain a and that helps you to learn domain B. So if you have two languages that are very close together, let’s say she’s sharp in Java. Then you probably experienced lots of positive trends. Like, Oh, I already know this. Oh, it’s exactly the same in Jaffa. That’s no issue. So that’s positive transfer, but then you also have. Negative transfer where you assume that something works a certain way and then it doesn’t. And for example, if you do, Oh, object oriented programming in Java, and then you go to Python, then there’s also object oriented programming. There’s also classes and methods. So maybe you’re like. I know this stuff. I understand what a method is. And then suddenly stuff, of course in Python happens as real time. And then you’re like, Whoa, everything I knew was wrong. So there you have negative transfer where you might assume that you know something and especially if you’re an expert and also you think this cannot be hard. I am already an expert programmer, so probably Python. Isn’t very hard. And then it’s harder than you think. And then of course you also run into issues of motivation where you’re like. I will never learn this because it’s so hard. So actually, if you want to improve on transfer, there are two techniques that people typically use and the techniques are called hugging and bridging. So hugging is where you try to get the concepts to be really close together. An example of hugging is if you already know Java. Then it might be easier for you to solve a problem in Java. So first you solve the problem in Java and then you simply, it’s not always simple, but simply translate your solution into, let’s say Python, if you’re learning that. So that makes it easier than the are. You’re trying to get the languages closer together. And with bridging you’re deliberately looking for concepts that are the same. So you, …</p></div></div></div></div>

				SSD`s are the life blood of our fmadio 10G, 40G, 100G ethernet capture systems. They provide backing storage that well exceeds that of conventional RAM, are super fast and light weight. Thus its prudent to keep the SSD farms in top nick, optimal health, and occasionally perform emergency room brain surgery on them. Unfortunately today is one of those days.

			</div>


		<p>
As with all things, it happened late on a Friday night when I was adding a new feature to the system that wipes all capture data from the system. This is simple button click on the web UI page as our clients data is quite sensitive thus needs to be deleted when the box moves internally or externally. The wipe is implemented using the "Secure Erase" ATA-8 command, you can read all about it <a href="https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase">here</a>. Its essentially a restore-to-factory-setting operation. Meaning after the SecureErase the drive`s internal state is the same as "just left the factory". 
		</p>
		
		<p>
Which is great when it works, but this kind of low level drive formatting is pretty complicated with many (presumably) asynchronous operations going on in parallel... and doing 100 of these operations back to back at high speed is probably something the vendor did not expect (I was testing dammit!). In our case this bricked 6 SSD`s rendering them completely useless causing myself quite the stress as I now have several thousand dollars worth of inventory destroyed!  - not a good day.

The usual suspects to recover were tried and failed, leaving only a few options.
<br>
</p>

<h5>a) RMA the boards back to the seller<br>
b) Contact vendor support<br>
c) Perform surgery</h5>


<p>
Option a) of RMA`ing the boards was the safest option, tho usually you get some other previously recycled RMA`ed device back. Option b) of contacting the vendor is always such a brutally painful experience. It would likely end up with some random "Customer Support" person with a strange accent... giving the default completely useless response of RMA the device and get a replacement kind of thing... ho hum. Which leaves surgery! Now I usually don't go messing with hardware like this (anymore... :) ) because it takes up quite a bit time. However SSD health and prosperity is directly linked to our profitability thus deemed it a worth while time investment to have a more intimate relationship with our SSD models of choice. 
</p>
<br>

<div><p>
The process starts with a general reconnaissance mission of what pins are accessible, and what those pins are for. First up was finding the UART / serial interface but it was silent and likely disabled by the firmware. Next up was what most likely looked like a JTAG interface and... bingo, full JTAG interface connecting and operating as expected.
</p><p>

 JTAG is a hardware based system debugger that for CPU`s let you control instruction execution and read/write memory anywhere. You can see in the picture below some soldering of header pins was required, that is then wired to a breadboard which is wired to a Raspberry PI.
</p></div>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_jtag.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd with jtag connected"></p><div><p>
Raspberry PI? wtf ? In this case the Raspberry PI was converted into a JTAG debugger using the outstanding software over at <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD</a>. As "real" JTAG debuggers are quite expensive ranging from $100 - $1000+ making OCD coupled with the PI an excellent low cost alternative. 
</p><p>

At this point you get a small rush as you gain access and poke the device, after which the vastness of having no idea what anything does starts to weigh you down. Then slowly bit by bit, instruction after instruction, string after string you gain some intuition on the memory map, what the code does, how its setup and eventually find something interesting.
</p></div> 

<p>

The first entry point to look for is the classic printf / trace / debug operation which gives you insight into what the software is doing. And eventually managed to track down the code that`s basically

<code>
void trace(char* Message, ...)
{ 
	va_arg list;
	va_start(arglist, Message);

	char buf[1024];
	vsprintf(buf, Message, arglist);

	if (debug_enable)
	{
		fwrite(output, buf, strlen(buf));
	}
}
</code>

which writes out a string to a console to tell the developer on whats going on. Note that the code has to "flatten" the string first before even deciding to output or not, which gives us a nice window to sniff the string with JTAG even if nothing is written to the console. 
</p>


<p>
After sniffing strings for a while and getting a better feel for whats happening noticed that the SSD is receiving commands from the SATA host no problem. But there`s some sort of funkyness going on that causes the SSD to send no response back - kind of a one-way-street. One idea to resolve this is: in theory the security erase operation restores everything back to good health. The question tho, is the device actually processing a security erase request ?  
</p>


<p>
... and using our printf JTAG sniffer... it most certainly is processing the request! But failing miserably due to an incorrect password. You can see the sniffed printf jtag string in the output below. Hint: <i>"&lt;SED&gt; Credential Comparison Failed"</i> ASCIIZ string.
</p>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_fail.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase fail"></p><p>
Which makes it clear why the security erase / factory reset failed but more importantly you can track down the offending bit of code from this string. That results in the following snippet of assembler courtesy of the IDA toolset below.
</p> 

<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_check.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password check"></p><p>
To decode that for you its doing a 32 byte long compare against some expected cryptographic hash key. Then the <i>"magic compare"</i> aka instruction <b>CMP R5, #1</b> is testing if the keys matched. Then doing a conditional jump to a printf routine based on that comparison result <b>BLNE sub_80...</b>. And finally  the functions return value is the result of the comparison <b>MOV R0, R5</b>. Nothing particularly fancy going on.
</p> 


<p>
There`s a few ways to go from here. One would be to reverse engineer how the 32B key is generated and create  a general purpose exploit. The other would be to just patch the binary such that it thinks it passed the security check. eg Fake a correct password response. We chose the latter as it only takes a few minutes and all I want is to restore the SSD farm`s health. Patching the binary with JTAG is trivial, console output is shown below.
</p> 


<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_patch.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password fake"></p><div><p>
The above shows disassembling the patched code first, the "before" section. This is to check we overwrite the correct bit of code. Then patch it using the command <b>cpu0 arm mww</b> with the value 0xe3a05001. Then disassemble again "after section" to confirm the patch worked and has the correct instruction. 
</p><p>

In this case we replaced <b>BLNE</b> instruction (print error message to the console) with <b>MOV r5, #1</b> at address 0x8009abe4 (shown in blue). The result of the "magic check" is 0 for fail, 1 for pass and write it to register r5. All we did is ignore the whole comparison and simply override it and say the security check always passes (r5 = 1).
</p></div> 

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Now its patched, with cpu`s resumed its the moment of truth. Issuing the security erase operation from the host system via hdparm. 
<br>
<code>
$ sudo hdparm --security-erase 1234  /dev/sdb
security_password="1234"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password="1234, user=user
$
</code>
<br>
... and it worked! the SSD is back to life, working as normal and running at high speed!  ... with <b>several thousand dollars worth of SSD`s back in business</b> making our 10G, 40G, 100G network capture systems more resilient than ever. Now if the SSD vendor (who shall remain nameless) would fix the dam bug so excessive back-to-back security password/erase does NOT brick the device, life would be so much better. 
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I wanted to write a program that I could feed a bunch of novels and then produce similar text to the author’s writing.</p>
<p>One method of generating fake but familiar looking text is to use a Markov chain generator. There is a fantastic Python library for doing this called <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify">jsvine/markovify</a> but I wanted to learn more about how it works under the hood so I implemented the algorithms from scratch!</p>
<p>Before we get to text generation, let’s start by generating some fake weather. Skip the following section if you’re familiar with Markov chains.</p>
<h2 id="fake-weather-generation"><a href="#fake-weather-generation" aria-label="fake weather generation permalink"></a>Fake Weather Generation</h2>
<p>I have some historical weather data from my town. The weather here is either sunny or rainy. When it’s sunny, there’s a good chance that it remains sunny the next day. It rarely rains but when it does it often rains for a few days.</p>
<p>Rather than using a naive probability (e.g. there’s an ~83% chance it is sunny vs. rainy on any given day) we’ll use a Markov chain to generate more realistic looking data. Our generated data will have streaks of weather which will more closely resemble real life patterns.</p>
<p>To be specific, if it’s sunny there’s a 10% chance it will be rainy the next day and a 90% chance it will stay sunny. If it’s rainy then there’s 50% chance it will be sunny the next day and a 50% chance it will stay rainy.</p>
<p>Here’s a diagram of this two-state Markov process.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/e4ae284c37dcdeb9323b73b3637b6709/b6699/weather-markov-chain.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Instead of using weights to describe probability, let’s distribute the states in a list that we randomly pick from. I find that defining Markov chains like this (while far more computationally expensive) is easier to debug.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>weather_chain <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'sun'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'rain'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We consume this model by picking a random starting state and using the current state to choose randomly from the possible future states. We do this over and over to generate a sequence.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>import</span> random


weather <span>=</span> <span>[</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span><span>list</span><span>(</span>weather_chain<span>.</span>keys<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>]</span>

<span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    weather<span>.</span>append<span>(</span>random<span>.</span>choice<span>(</span>weather_chain<span>[</span>weather<span>[</span>i<span>]</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example output, we can see that rainy days are ‘sticky’ as we would expect from the model. </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'rain'</span><span>,</span> <span>'sun'</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="fake-text-generation"><a href="#fake-text-generation" aria-label="fake text generation permalink"></a>Fake Text Generation</h2>
<p>Instead of having a predefined Markov chain like we saw in the previous section, let’s build one from real data. The full source code for this article and the text corpuses can be found at <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/markov-chain-generator">healeycodes/markov-chain-generator</a>.</p>
<p>The code excerpts assume that we’re generating fiction. So the source text must have capital letters at the start of sentences and full stops at the end of sentences. We can use these two markers to generate text chunks that have a beginning and an end.</p>
<p>In our weather example, the state size was one — to decide the next step in the sequence, we only considered one previous day of weather. When it comes to generating language, a state size of one sometimes isn’t big enough and the arrangement of words can be too random to be interesting. A state size of two is a good starting point. Going higher than two can produce text that is too similar to the original text corpus.</p>
<p>The following function builds a Markov chain in the same format as our weather example. It takes a source text and a state size and returns a dictionary where the keys are the current state and their values are a list of possible future states. The lists contain duplicates and this is how we handle the probabilities of future states.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>build_model</span><span>(</span>source<span>,</span> state_size<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>'''

<p>Here are those four possible complete sentences from our previous Markov chain. These can be combined infinitely by our function.</p>

'An orange is very good.'
'An apple is very good.'</code></pre></div>

<p>We can now feed in large amounts of text from an author and generate fake writing! In fact, any corpus that uses sentences will work with our program. For example, here is the result of feeding in a few Wikipedia articles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cricket is more similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led to the latest hour of it; and lately, I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all the more remote islands. At around the field. One of Wollstonecraft’s most popular metaphors draw on military concepts: Disease is an early type of fiction that were quick to resort to violence. One of Wollstonecraft’s favorite arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s some Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Count could recollect, it was never worth the trouble of the stranger. But, as usual, enveloped in frequent rolls, or bandages, of linen; but, in place of conference with the whole matter as a natural result of the river, and, plunging through a single slender gold chain, and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all. I cannot enter into details just now: but it was found, on Sunday morning, that he was forced to allow, had ever suspected of existing in the heathen is unwonted; and fickle-mindedness has ever thought of this life and of cutting him off with a layer of plaster, thickly gilt and painted.</p>

<p>The sun/rain example was taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examples_of_Markov_chains#A_simple_weather_model">Wikipedia</a>. Victor Powell’s article, <a href="https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/">Markov Chains</a>, was also helpful for my initial understanding and is worth checking out for the interactive graphics alone.</p>
<p>Some of the articles about Markov chains are a little inaccessible to those without a maths background. However, there’s a Simple English version of Wikipedia. Many articles have an alternative page which you can find by replacing the <code>en</code> in the URL bar with <code>simple</code>. For example, the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">simple version</a> of the Markov chain page.</p>

<h2>And how memetics will guide future tech products</h2>

<p>“Who controls the memes controls the universe” tweeted Elon Musk, referencing a line from <em>Dune</em>. Somehow it feels both trollish and profound.</p>



<p>If you live on the internet, you know it when you see it. Memes are everywhere. More importantly, it feels like memes matter today. A well-crafted internet joke like Musk’s can yield more attention than a well-funded PR campaign. </p>



<p>Lately, I’ve been reading a fascinating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meme_Machine">book</a> on the topic. First, I learned the academic definition of memes is far more expansive than just internet jokes. Richard Dawkins coined the term meme to refer to fashions, ceremonies, customs, and technologies that spread across human brains. The mechanism: mimesis, better known as imitation.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>[Dawkins] discussed [meme] propagation by jumping from brain to brain, likened them to parasites infecting a host, treated them as physically realised living structures, and showed how mutually assisting memes will gang together in groups just as genes do. Most importantly, he treated the meme as a replicator in its own right. </em><strong><em>Everything you have learned by imitation from someone else is a meme.</em></strong><em> But we must be clear what is meant by the word ‘imitation’, because our whole understanding of memetics depends on it. Dawkins said that memes jump from ‘brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation’ (1976, p. 192)…</em></p><p><em>Everything that is passed from person to person in this way is a meme. This includes all the words in your vocabulary, the stories you know, the skills and habits you have picked up from others and the games you like to play. It includes the songs you sing and the rules you obey. So, for example, whenever you drive on the left (or the right!), eat curry with lager or pizza and coke, whistle the theme tune from ‘Neighbours’ or even shake hands, you are dealing in memes. Each of these memes has evolved in its own unique way with its own history, but each of them is using your behaviour to get itself copied.</em></p><cite><strong>Susan Blackmore “The Meme Machine”</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>Think of memes as the smallest atomic unit of culture. Some memes are funny, some are relatable, and some are not very useful and don’t spread widely. </p>



<p>Memetic theory says these mind-viruses compete against each other for their slot in the next human brain. Some memes make it. Others don’t. (Even more interestingly, some memes make it without regard to their real-world usefulness—only their ability to <a href="https://bitesizebio.com/1344/selfish-genes-and-gene-centered-evolution/">replicate</a> most effectively.) Memes, they argue, are part of a Darwinian system. This is all rooted in the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism#:~:text=Universal%20Darwinism%20(also%20known%20as,of%20biological%20evolution%20on%20Earth.">Universal Darwinism</a>, which says evolution applies to any “replicator” with the following conditions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>selection </strong>– the fittest survive</li><li><strong>variation </strong>– there are slight changes between copies</li><li><strong>heredity </strong>– the offspring inherits characteristics from the parent</li></ul>



<p>Memes satisfy these conditions and replicate “cultural instructions” just like genes do. </p>



<p>Of course, our lives are increasingly digital. Arguably, more culture is mediated through media and tech platforms than in real life. Thinkers like Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett were talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/5f-JlzBuUUU?t=932">cultural evolution</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzGjEkp772s">theory of mind</a> abstractly more than, say, lip-syncing TikToks. Even so, types of social media posts—as digital shipping containers for memes—help them propagate.</p>



<p>To social media’s credit, they’ve taken the Darwin-governed world of memes and built fairly Darwinian systems around them. Now, a retweet button here or a like button there governs how memes spread (or struggle for life). Digital memes satisfy all the evolutionary pre-conditions:</p>



<ul><li><strong>selection </strong>– some posts get comments &amp; likes, going viral and becoming part of public awareness</li><li><strong>variation </strong>– every story gets told slightly differently</li><li><strong>heredity </strong>– Meme image templates, quote tweeting, TikTok duets all derive from existing content</li></ul>



<p>You can expect a lineage to form from the most “successful” genres of social media posts. Viral templates survive for a reason.</p>



<p>Seeing social media through a memetic lens is, admittedly, a bit confusing. It’s hard to know where the shipping container begins and ends. In theory, they’re merely vehicles for culture to hitch a ride on. (As Blackmore wrote, memes are “substrate-neutral.”) But the mechanisms are worth studying. The difference between a Twitter meme (e.g. “Time for a thread”)  and newspaper meme (e.g. “Area man…”) is the memetic evolution has been turned up a few notches. It spawns imitators way faster. Anyone can chime in with their own version.</p>



<p>If memes behave like genes, perhaps the various tech platforms resemble the different climate zones, where possessing a certain trait is highly adaptive. (Aside: Is Facebook akin to a tropical rainforest, enabling the most memeo-diversity? It might not be provable or even helpful to ponder.) The point is certain memes are naturally selected based on their product choices.</p>



<p>Finally, and most notably, memes travel across regions at a startling pace. Like an invasive species caught in a ballast tank, digital shipping containers spread memes farther and faster than ever. Every human brain is now a potential target.</p>



<h2>The first great meme machine</h2>



<p>In 2006, internet analyst Mary Meeker was asked how Google could justify its acquisition of YouTube for $1.65B. Meeker made the bull case and pointed out that YouTube felt like a natural evolution:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“What’s interesting to me about the evolution of media today is that these 3 minutes clips–and I’m generalizing–that are amateur in nature are often times very funny. Because people happen to be in the right place at the right time. When I first watched some funny videos on the internet, I was reminded of the early days of MTV when music was presented in a different way. And I was also reminded of the early days of Saturday Night Live…my hope and my bet is that [YouTube] was an event that will push the traditional content creators to focus more aggressively on monetizing their content on the internet.</em></p><cite><strong>Mary Meeker (</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/NpappaG/status/1059891535553138689?s=20"><strong>full clip</strong></a><strong>)</strong></cite></blockquote>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tech Analyst GOALS: vintage edition</p><p>Mary Meeker on Google's then-insane purchase of YouTube (circa 2006). </p><p>-believed in amateur content far before it was obvious<br>-uses great analogies (MTV, SNL) <br>-prescient call on YT's creator network<br>(h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/mlcwong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mlcwong</a>) <a href="https://t.co/HsAK7Slobx">pic.twitter.com/HsAK7Slobx</a></p></div>— Nick Pappageorge (@NpappaG) <a href="https://twitter.com/NpappaG/status/1059891535553138689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2018</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The analysis still looks spot-on 14 years later.</p>



<p>What made YouTube special was its ability to aggregate short, punchy clips that are “amateur in nature.” The rest is history. With time, that ushered in a whole creator economy and encouraged media corporates to buy in. Now, banks value YouTube at $200B – $300B alone, making it one of the greatest M&amp;A deals of all time.</p>



<p>YouTube’s scale and early start allowed it to enjoy a near-monopoly on virality, at least in video form. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFcyTuopbI">Damn Daniel</a>” and countless other memes from YouTube have ported over to everyday conversation. Previously, viral internet ideas spread as static images with editable text. Video added a new level of fidelity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, YouTube’s scale allows the world’s ideas, jokes, and culture get replicated to the tune of <a href="https://npappag.com/2020/01/10/youtube-is-the-worlds-biggest-radio-station/">100 billion hours per day</a>. Like any good social technology, YouTube unleashed an extremely powerful broadcast tool. In its wake, trillions of bits of cultural material spread from brain to brain. YouTube perhaps the first great meme machine on the internet.</p>



<p>In terms of meme replication power, YouTube enjoyed the last decade without a credible challenger. That is, until the rise of TikTok.</p>



<h2>The second great (video) meme machine</h2>



<p>TikTok has famously taken video virality to another level. There’s some great write-ups about the <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat">history of TikTok</a>, and how it <a href="https://turner.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-tiktok-and-understanding">pivoted </a>its app Musical.ly into what it is today. Personally, I think the most remarkable feature is TikTok’s explicit focus on memes.</p>



<p>TikTok’s main differentiator is audio-related. In every video, the audio itself can easily be “forked”—or copied—into a half-original new creation. All you have to do is film something compelling over it. This is not a huge secret. Every TikTok user knows there’s a song ID at the bottom of every video, and if pressed, will show you all the other videos using that song. From there, it will even encourage you to film your own imitation, lowering the friction to creation.</p>



<div><figure><video controls="" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/5xatgbOO/rpreplay_final1603556317.mp4"></video></figure><div>
<h4>Audio forking spawns thousands of imitations</h4>



<p>Currently, Fleetwood Mac’s song “Dreams” is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/entertainment/fleetwood-mac-dreams-charts-trnd/index.html">back in the charts</a> again thanks to Doggface208 <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@420doggface208/video/6876424179084709126?source=h5_m">posting</a> a TikTok video lip-syncing on a skateboard while drinking Ocean Spray. Thousands of others have “forked” the Fleetwood Mac audio, and replicated DoggFace208’s video while skateboarding on their own. Other hit songs have minted entire video genres. [See video left]</p>
</div></div>



<p>The platform offers more than just dancing along to famous songs. The same applies to videos with original audio, which also can go equally viral as people iterate on the audio-meme. Often, this is done with the “duet” feature, where creators anticipate remixes on a script they create.</p>



<p>TikTok’s chief innovation is often said to be the creation tools, the mobile focus, the constrained time limit, or the superior algorithm. Those are all important. But I suggest the most important factor is this “A/V forking”–splitting audio and video–that encourages imitation.</p>



<p>By splitting content into the audio and visual, the hurdle for creating an entertaining video gets (1) easier for the creator and (2) exponentially more competitive in aggregate. Often, the original post of a viral TikTok is outdone by imitators that “perform” over the audio in an <em>even more</em> entertaining way. As a result, TikTok’s native content is far more explosive and gripping compared to YouTube.</p>



<p>The way TikTok focuses on memes is intentional and apparently the product of rigorous focus group testing. From <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-a-youtube-star-helped-make-tiktok-a-global-hit">The Information</a>‘s paywalled piece:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>A friend received an offer from a seed-stage startup this week. Already at another seed-stage startup, she asked my thoughts on the offer itself and on the switch between companies. I walked through the factors I consider in my own decisions, but as I talked, I felt less sure of my own process. Nothing in the startup world is certain; </span><a href="https://medium.com/@justincie/startup-success-isnt-about-genius-it-s-about-manipulating-the-odds-873d93d02029" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>we are all just betting on outcomes</span></a><span>. We can optimize for certain factors, but in the end, we must decide how to play our hand. Plenty has been written about joining a startup, but how do we decide when to leave one?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>A startup is </span><a href="https://medium.com/start-up-vision/a-startup-is-either-growing-or-dying-564af328a6c4" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>either growing or dying</span></a><span>, and a well-positioned one should have a strong market, assets, and team. Even with all three, the journey will still be difficult. If the bus is going to run out of gas before reaching the destination, does it matter </span><a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/first-who-then-what.html" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>if I’m in the right seat</span></a><span>? First think through business viability to figure out if you even want to be on the bus. Here are questions I use to get started.</span></p>

<p><b>Market</b></p>
<p><span>If the market is established:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Who are the competitors in the space?</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>What do the recent IPOs/acquisitions look like?</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>What is the company’s competitive edge?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>If the market is new:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Why is now the right time to start the market?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Why will the company succeed in places other companies haven’t gone?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Assets</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>How far along is the product?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Who are the customers and how are the relationships?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>What’s the funding situation?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Who are the investors?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Team</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Does the team have the right experience to execute what needs to happen?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Are there growth plans to mitigate the obstacles that lie ahead?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Do people know their own strengths and weaknesses?</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Are difficult and honest conversations being had about the company’s direction?</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Feeling good about all three? Plenty can still go wrong, but your company might have a chance. If two of the three are in a good place, is there a route to quickly strengthen the third? What would it take to make that happen and how likely is the company to execute on it? It’s impossible to predict all of the factors crucial to success, but it doesn’t hurt to ask the questions.</span></p>

<p><span>Maybe the startup is doing incredibly well, but you’re feeling less sure about your seat on the bus. Is that a sign you need to leave or just </span><a href="https://medium.com/@ubiquityvc/startup-vs-big-tech-why-the-grass-isnt-always-greener-e8cebb6d5191" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>“grass is greener”</span></a><span> syndrome?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Try running a </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-negative-thinking-can-help-you-successfully-make-decisions-2020-10" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>pre-mortem</span></a><span> on your career trajectory. Write out how you might fail and what the fallout could be. Will you lose relationships because of the long hours you put into the startup? Will the stress of the long hours cause you to pack on pounds? Will you end up wishing that you had stayed at your startup until it went public?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Looking at the worst case scenario can show us that what we most fear either won’t be that bad or that we can proactively avoid it. Identify the paths you’ll regret most and </span><a href="https://alyjuma.medium.com/the-regret-minimization-framework-how-jeff-bezos-made-decisions-4d5a86deaf24" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>work to avoid them</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>But what about the best case scenario in which your hard-earned equity turns into millions? </span><a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/stock-options-are-for-suckers-who-accept-below-market-rate-pay/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>It’s highly unlikely</span></a><span> but not impossible. Are you optimizing the factors that matter most to you where you are?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Salary</b></p>
<p><span>Early-stage startups aren’t known for particularly high salaries, but if you’re with the company as it goes through additional rounds of funding, this can change. Significant contributors have more leeway on compensation than they might know, especially if additional funding has come through.</span></p>

<p><b>Title</b></p>
<p><span>Yes, titles are subjective because they differ widely between companies, but they can also give weight to your credentials. Are there still opportunities to move up the ladder where you are, even if that will mean creating a new title? Would you be able to get the same title outside of your company?</span></p>

<p><b>Equity</b></p>
<p><span>Do you have enough stake in the company to feel that your contributions could eventually pay off? Again, it’s unlikely, but we have to </span><a href="https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/take-asymmetric-bets" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>take asymmetric bets</span></a><span> to win big.</span></p>

<p><b>Knowledge</b></p>
<p><span>Learning doesn’t pay the bills, but incredible experience from one role can shape the rest of your career.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Are you getting more responsibility than you might at another company?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Are you in the room when big decisions are being made?</span></li>
<li><span>Are you working alongside industry experts that you may not have the chance to be near again?</span></li>
<li><span>Are you establishing relationships (customers, investors, coworkers) that will propel you forward later on?</span></li>

<p>This repo fork from karminski/ethr-kai and modified by Karminski-牙医. A WEB UI with websocket was added in this fork.</p>
<p>Ethr is a cross platform network performance measurement tool written in golang. The goal of this project is to provide a native tool for comprehensive network performance measurements of bandwidth, connections/s, packets/s, latency, loss &amp; jitter, across multiple protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and across multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux and other Unix systems.</p>
<p>Ethr takes inspiration from existing open source network performance tools and builds upon those ideas. For Bandwidth measurement, it is similar to iPerf3, for TCP &amp; UDP traffic. iPerf3 has many more options for doing such as throttled testing, richer feature set, while Ethr has support for multiple threads, that allows it to scale to 1024 or even higher number of connections, multiple clients communication to a single server etc. For latency measurements, it is similar to latte on Windows or sockperf on Linux.</p>
<p>Ethr provides more test measurements as compared to other tools, e.g. it provides measurements for bandwidth, connections/s, packets/s, latency, and TCP connection setup latency, all in a single tool. In the future, there are plans to add more features (hoping for others to contribute) as well as more protocol support to make it a comprehensive tool for network performance measurements.</p>
<p>Ethr is natively cross platform, thanks to golang, as compared to compiling via an abstraction layer like cygwin that may limit functionality. It hopes to unify performance measurement by combining the functionality of tools like iPerf3, ntttcp, psping, sockperf, and latte and offering a single tool across multiple platforms and multiple protocols.</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://kotlintesting.com/q-a-from-conferences-2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kotlintesting.com/q-a-from-conferences-2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>In 2020 I had an opportunity to present my thoughts about crucial element of unit testing - test doubles. I discussed various examples of test doubles, ways to implement them and how they fit into specific test cases. Links to the conference talks you can find at the bottom of the article. </p><p>Every talk had time for Q&amp;A, and now I answer some of the questions that were asked. </p><h3 id="how-to-approach-testing-private-methods">How to approach testing private methods?</h3><blockquote>tl;dr: you don't test it directly, but within context </blockquote><p>Let's take a look at example:</p><pre><code>class ShouldITestPrivateMethods {
    fun processSomething(input: Int): String {
        return if (input &gt;= 420) {
            "Number is greater or equal 420"
        } else {
            "You need to add ${420 - input} to get 420"
        }
    }
}</code></pre><p>This class is pretty simple - returns some text based on input number. There is no private methods here. We write parameterized test for some cases and we compare result to expected values. </p><p>But during refactor we could've change it to something like this:</p><pre><code>class ShouldITestPrivateMethods {
    fun processSomething(input: Int): String {
        return if (input &gt;= CONSTANT_NUMBER) {
            "Number is greater or equal $CONSTANT_NUMBER"
        } else {
            "You need to add ${calculateDifference(input)} to get $CONSTANT_NUMBER"
        }
    }

    private fun calculateDifference(input: Int) = CONSTANT_NUMBER - input
    
    companion object{
        private const val CONSTANT_NUMBER = 420
    }
}</code></pre><p>Now we have private method here. Do we need to test that private method? If we provided enough reasonable test cases for method <em>processSomething() </em>then we should be secure about that. </p><p>On the other hand, if for some reason that calculation become more complex, we could think about extracting this private method into separate class, that would be tested alone in isolation.</p><pre><code>class DifferenceCalculator {
    fun differenceBetween(first: Int, second: Int): Int {
        return first - second
    }
}

class ShouldITestPrivateMethods(
    private val differenceCalculator: DifferenceCalculator
) {
    fun processSomething(input: Int): String {
        return if (input &gt;= CONSTANT_NUMBER) {
            "Number is greater or equal $CONSTANT_NUMBER"
        } else {
            "You need to add ${calculateDifference(input)} to get $CONSTANT_NUMBER"
        }
    }

    fun calculateDifference(input: Int) = differenceCalculator.differenceBetween(
        first = CONSTANT_NUMBER,
        second = input
    )

    companion object {
        private const val CONSTANT_NUMBER = 420
    }
}</code></pre><p>To sum things up:</p><ul><li>test private behavior in context of public accessors</li><li>refactor private behavior - extract it to higher component</li><li>don't just change private modifier to public to test code</li></ul><p>And last, but not least, don't make private method public. Your future self will thank you for keeping strict property access. </p><h3 id="do-you-use-verifynomoreinteractions">Do you use verifyNoMoreInteractions?</h3><blockquote>tl;dr In unit tests - almost never. In integrations tests - sometimes.</blockquote><p>Let's take a look at javadoc for <em>Mockito.verifyNoMoreInteractions:</em></p><pre><code>/**
* Checks if any of given mocks has any unverified interaction.
* &lt;p&gt;
* You can use this method after you verified your mocks - to make sure that nothing
* else was invoked on your mocks.
**/</code></pre><p>Where it could be useful? Lets take a look at example.</p><pre><code>import java.util.function.Consumer

class System(
    private val consumer: Consumer&lt;Any&gt;
) : AutoCloseable {

    var shouldAccept = true

    fun ping() {
        if (shouldAccept) {
            consumer.accept(Any())
        }
    }

    override fun close() {
        shouldAccept = false
    }
}</code></pre><p>Now we'd like to assert that consumer won't accept value if system was already closed:</p><pre><code>import com.nhaarman.mockitokotlin2.*
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class Verifications {
    @Test
    fun checkVerifications() {
        val mockConsumer = mock&lt;Consumer&lt;Any&gt;&gt;()
        val system = System(consumer = mockConsumer)

        system.ping()
        system.ping()

        verify(mockConsumer, times(2)).accept(any())

        system.close()
        system.ping()

        verifyNoMoreInteractions(mockConsumer)
    }
}</code></pre><p> We're checking that after system creation and two <em>ping() </em>method invocations, consumer accepted two values. Then, we close system and make one more extra assertion: no more interactions on mock.</p><p>We can refactor this test method to check the same behavior without using <em>noMoreInteractions:</em></p><pre><code>class Verifications {
    @Test
    fun checkVerifications() {
        val mockConsumer = mock&lt;Consumer&lt;Any&gt;&gt;()
        val system = System(consumer = mockConsumer)

        system.ping()
        system.ping()

        system.close()
        system.ping()

        verify(mockConsumer, times(2)).accept(any())
    }
}</code></pre><p>And now we have one assertion at the end of the test.</p><p>Is using <em>verifyNoMoreInteractions</em> worth it? Maybe it is, for work-in-progress tests when you are not sure how to approach given test scenario or for more complex integrations test when you have to be sure that nothing else happened on given mock. But I'm sure that in unit test scenario there are better tools to do the same job.</p><h3 id="should-android-developers-exchange-mockito-with-mockk">Should Android developers exchange Mockito with MockK?</h3><blockquote>tl;dr: it's up to your preferences and your coding style</blockquote><p>I would rephrase this question to <em>should Kotlin developers exchange Mockito with MockK</em>, since most of new native Android projects are written in Kotlin.</p><p>For new projects: <strong>absolutely</strong> <strong>yes</strong>. Mockk gives you first-class Kotlin support (such as mocking suspend functions). </p><p><strong>You don't have to rewrite all your test doubles from Mockito to MockK</strong> - it is possible to use together even within the same test class, but for the sake of readability, use one mocking framework for one test class. If you just adding new test cases to existing class - use mocking framework that was used there before.</p><h3 id="how-about-using-mockito-kotlin-instead-of-regular-mockito-in-kotlin-projects">How about using Mockito-Kotlin instead of regular Mockito in Kotlin projects?</h3><blockquote>tl;dr It's the way.</blockquote><p>For rewriting regular Mockito test case to Mockito-Kotlin DSL check this article:</p><figure><a href="https://kotlintesting.com/using-mockito-in-kotlin-projects/"><div><p>Using Mockito in Kotlin projects</p><p>Refactoring Java Mockito based test suite to Mockito-Kotlin DSL</p><p><img src="https://kotlintesting.com/favicon.png"><span>Kotlin Testing</span></p></div><p><img src="https://kotlintesting.com/content/images/2020/10/mint.jpeg"></p></a></figure><h3 id="how-to-approach-building-test-suite-for-project-that-has-no-tests-at-all">How to approach building test suite for project that has no tests at all?</h3><blockquote>tl;dr: start with integration tests and once they are passing, refactor and write unit tests</blockquote><p>That surely depends on complexity of your project. If there are no test at all, you would focus on testing components that has highest business value. You may start here with integration or E2E tests. </p><p>For backend project - you can start with testing REST controller - &nbsp;you setup in-memory database, setup rest of Spring context and just invoke controllers method with given set of params. </p><p>For backend projects in Ktor - check this article:</p><figure><a href="https://kotlintesting.com/intro-to-testing-ktor-controllers/"><div><p>Testing Ktor Controllers</p><p>Functional tests in Ktor - how to mock application server with TestApplicationEngine?</p><p><img src="https://kotlintesting.com/favicon.png"><span>Jarosław Michalik</span><span>Kotlin Testing</span></p></div><p><img src="https://kotlintesting.com/content/images/2020/11/Zrzut-ekranu-2020-11-8-o-12.05.19.png"></p></a></figure><p>For mobile projects - you may record test cases with Espresso recorder or start with integration test for presentation layer.</p><p>If you have happy few paths tested - you may start with refactoring code to clean architecture approach.

February 2, 2021 | https://www.danielwatts.info/post/7-behaviours-to-avoid-software-architect/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.danielwatts.info/post/7-behaviours-to-avoid-software-architect/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work in architecture roles alongside experienced software/technical/solution architects. Through observing others and my own trial and error, I’ve learned a little bit about what <em>not</em> to do in these roles (because it’s often easier to reflect on what didn’t work rather than what did). Even though I lean towards the idea that everyone should be architecting the system rather than having architects solely responsible - I recognise that some organisations are far from that ideal, and it’s those folks I hope find this list helpful. So here it is, 7 behaviours to avoid if you’re in a software architecture role:</p>
<h2 id="1-dont-ignore-the-engineering-team">1. Don’t ignore the engineering team</h2>
<p>If you’re not “hands-on” with the engineering team either through writing or reviewing code or deep in the technical discussions, then the likelihood is you aren’t close enough to the problems and the individuals on the team. If you’re not feeling their pain, then you are probably lacking the empathy and understanding to provide effective guidance. If you find yourself in this position, I would consider beginning with one-on-ones and pairing with engineers as the quickest way to increase empathy and understanding. Then look to participate in feature kick-offs, technical design discussions and code reviews where necessary.</p>
<h2 id="2-dont-ignore-the-domain">2. Don’t ignore the domain</h2>
<p>It’s part of the role to become a domain expert. This knowledge can be used to act as an effective translator between business and engineering. That said, you’ll want to avoid being a communication bottleneck too, so it’s important to teach, translate and document domain context and business value for the engineering team. This is where techniques like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/value-stream-mapping">value-stream mapping</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming">event storming</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ntcoding/status/1342805885224177666">domain-driven design</a> can really help.</p>
<h2 id="3-dont-prescribe-or-mandate-architectures">3. Don’t prescribe or mandate architectures</h2>
<p>For the most part, our industry has moved past the notion that a system’s architecture is designed in isolation (or in an ivory tower) and handed-off to engineers to deliver. However, it definitely still happens. Software architecture and development should be inter-weaving activities, with feedback from one influencing the other. Keeping that feedback loop as short as possible will likely lead to better outcomes. So if you would like to design and create more resilient systems and your organisation tends to mandate or prescribe architectures; consider how you can best empower engineers to make sound architecture decisions instead. Working with the engineers to agree on a foundation of architectural principles and accepting that architecture is never done, it should evolve and change over time are good places to begin (see the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/building-evolutionary-architectures">Building Evolutionary Architectures</a> book for more on this).</p>
<h2 id="4-dont-just-seek-architectural-consistency">4. Don’t just seek architectural consistency</h2>
<p>Consistency certainly has a place in organisations that build and maintain many systems in order to to help prevent complexity. In my opinion, it’s better to see it as a guideline that will likely have exceptions. Simply seeking or worse, enforcing consistency is a sure-fire way to slow the team down, squash innovation and reduce learning opportunities.</p>
<h2 id="5-dont-forget-about-the-current-architectural-state">5. Don’t forget about the current architectural state</h2>
<p>It can be useful to model a target architecture based on agreed principles and in collaboration with engineers (see #1 and #3 above). However, it must be founded in all the nuance and understanding of the current architecture. Anything else could lead towards a doomed rewrite, an unhappy team or a failed pitch to some confused engineers.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I’ve seen many conversations where stakeholders begin to assume the target state is in fact the current state. This can have significant downsides for the engineering team, for example; a sense of moving too slow, missed tasks that were presumed completed or a lack of appreciation upon completing a large chunk of technical work. Stakeholder discussions about target state may need to include regular reminders about the current state.</p>
<h2 id="6-dont-get-too-attached-to-the-desired-architecture">6. Don’t get too attached to the desired architecture</h2>
<p>It can be easy to fall into the trap of attaching an opinion to your identity, particularly if you’ve got the task of providing a technical direction for an engineering team. New information and unforeseen circumstances will emerge, so any target state will 100% change. As these scenarios surface, you will need to keep an open mind to adapt your view and the direction. A fixed view will only hold back progress. As mentioned in #3, the architecture should be going through constant, incremental change.</p>
<h2 id="7-dont-let-review-processes-stagnate">7. Don’t let review processes stagnate</h2>
<p>As an architect in a large organisation you are likely to be responsible for or actively involved in architectural and security review processes, either as a reviewer or seeking a review. These processes are often change approval reviews that give the green-light for a production release. They can be long and drawn out, unclear in their value, involve reviewers who have zero context, and result in unwanted or unnecessary outcomes; making them the perfect candidates for resisting change. As a more senior figure, an architect should be working hard against that intuition. They should seek to understand the purpose and value of the review process and relay it to others. They should be leading or guiding engineering teams through these processes, particularly for the first time. But most importantly, they should be constantly pushing to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-process-streamlining-change-approval">improve, reduce or potentially remove a review process</a> depending on its purpose and added value.</p>
<p>There you have it! Hopefully I’ll learn even more things to avoid in future but for now, avoid these and you should be good; or at the very least better than a bunch of scenarios I’ve witnessed. For more advice on the topic of software architecture, check out these excellent reads too:</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://carltheperson.com/posts/10-things-linux">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><i>2020-11-28<!-- --> Carl Riis</i></p><hr><h3>How do you advance your Linux skills when you are already comfortable with the basics? My solution was to come up with 10 subjects to learn and create an accompanying mini-project.</h3><p>All the source code for the projects can be found in <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-things-linux">this</a> GitHub repository.</p><h2>1. UNIX - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/1_UNIX__Recat">Recat</a></h2><p>The first thing I wanted to learn more about was UNIX since Linux is a UNIX-like operating system. I also never really felt that I fully understood what exactly UNIX was, besides being a family of fairly similar operating systems.</p><p>The first thing I did was to read the entire Wikipedia page on UNIX. I also read <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf">this</a> original paper written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson from 1974, which was really interesting though I can’t say I understood all of it. After some more reading and some Youtube videos, I felt comfortable that I understood what UNIX was, and what makes it interesting.</p><p>For the project, I decided to try and write my first C program. Following the Unix philosophy, I made sure that it did one thing only. That thing ended up being a program that reverses the contents of a text file. Since this is just a reverse version of <em>cat</em>, I called the program <em>recat</em>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/1_UNIX__Recat/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>2. What is a shell? - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/2_What_is_a_shell__SeaShell">SeaShell</a></h2><p>For this project, I was curious to find out what exactly a shell was. Even though it is something that I use often, I was still confused about what differentiates it from the terminal. Turns out it’s really not that complicated. I learned this by rereading the <em>shell</em> part of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf">the paper</a> from the previous project, and some explanations online like <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm">this</a> and <a href="https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php">this one</a>. The Unix shell Wikipedia entry was also very informative.</p><p>Since this project is about the shell, I found it appropriate to try and write my own. I settled on the name <em>SeaShell</em>, which I found way too funny. It’s not very advanced, but it does the job.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/2_What_is_a_shell__SeaShell/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>3. Ownership and permissions - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess">Tellaccess</a></h2><p>This is one of the things that I know is really important for Linux, but have never really understood. I have tried before but never been able to get the knowledge to stick, maybe because I didn't really care about security until now.</p><p>The ownership and permission system turned out to be really intuitive, and I was able to understand the basics from <a href="https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-basic-file-permissions-and-ownership-in-linux/">this</a> one article. I later discovered <a href="https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/">this one</a> from Linux Handbook which was more comprehensive.</p><p>For the project, I decided to create a program that tells you in human-readable form, the ownership and permissions of a file. I called the project <em>tellaccess</em> because it tells you who can access the file in what ways.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/3_Ownership_and_permissions__Tellaccess/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>4. Grep - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/4_Grep__Grep_detective">Grep detective</a></h2><p>Grep is the sort of UNIX magic I have always wanted to learn. Since <em>grep</em> is all about regular expressions I would have to learn that first. This was actually quite difficult because grep uses the <em>POSIX Basic Regular Expressions</em>, which is not that common. The <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions">Wikipedia entry</a> was a lifesaver. Besides that, I also used the man page for <em>grep</em> as a reference.</p><p>For the project, I thought that a fun idea might be to create a detective game. In the game, you get a folder full of files, and it’s your job to extract information. I called the game <em>Grep detective</em>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/4_Grep__Grep_detective/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>5. Awk and sed - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/5_Awk_and_sed__Passwdinfo">Passwdinfo</a></h2><p><em>Awk</em> and <em>sed</em> are more of the UNIX magic that I have always thought was really cool, though I never really understood what they were used for. I often saw answers on Stack Overflow with people using them in crazy one-liners, but I always copy-pasted them without much thought. Well, time to unravel the mystery.</p><p>I primarily used <a href="https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mijp1/teaching/2nd_year_Comp_Lab/guides/grep_awk_sed.pdf">this</a> paper to learn about them. For the project, I wanted to create my own one-liner that shows information about the users on your system in a clear way. I found just reading the <em>/etc/passwd</em> a little too messy, so the project <em>passwdinfo</em>, displays the most important information in a neat table. I found information about the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/">here</a>.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/5_Awk_and_sed__Passwdinfo/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>6. Find - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/6_Find__Find_treasure_hunt">Find treasure hunt</a></h2><p>Another important tool I never really got around to learning. Learning how to use <em>find</em> was fairly easy, it was mostly about memorizing the different flags, and the format you set the flags in. I used <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/admm">this</a> as a reference.</p><p>For the project, I created a treasure hunt where you look for clues in files with different attributes. I first wrote a script that created a bunch of small files and directories as noise. Then a selected few of the files got clues to the whereabouts of the other ones. In the end, you find the treasure, which I won’t tell you what is.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/6_Find__Find_treasure_hunt/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>7. File system - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/7_File_system__Root_tour">Root tour</a></h2><p>Ever since I executed my first <em>ls /</em> I have wondered what all those directories were for. Time to unveil the mystery. The first thing I did was read <a href="https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/">this</a> article as it explained each directory in root and provided a nice graph. <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html">This</a> resource was also nice since it had a table that summed up each directory in one or two sentences.</p><p>The project ended up being a program that gives you descriptions for directories in your own root folder.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/7_File_system__Root_tour/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>8. Processes - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/8_Processes__Stranger_danger">Stranger danger</a></h2><p>Processes are another important element of Linux that I have never gotten around to learning. Like many other subjects I have covered here, it turned out to be fairly intuitive. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/processes-in-linuxunix/">This</a> article was really easy to understand.</p><p>I was contemplating for a while what kind of project I could create but ultimately came up with a command that prints all processes that don’t belong to you or root. That way, you can keep a close eye on who is creating processes. Note, there are many legitimate reasons that other users would run processes on your system, and it rarely means someone has gained access to your computer.</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/8_Processes__Stranger_danger/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>9. Systemd services - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/9_Systemd_services__Createservice">Createservice</a></h2><p>Whenever I try to set up a database on a Linux machine I have been confused about how to configure the <em>systemd</em> service. I have also been in situations where I needed to create a service from a binary but always struggled. The struggle ends now.
As with any new subject, it’s always a good idea to read the Wikipedia page, so that is where I started. Surprisingly, I learned that <em>systemd</em> is a quite controversial piece of software, but I still wanted to learn it and judge it for myself.
For understanding the basics of <em>systemd</em> I read <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units">this</a> and for understanding how to create a new service I read <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/create-new-service-units-in-systemd/">this</a>.</p><p>For the project, I made <em>createservice</em>, which allows you to make a <em>systemd</em> service from any executable that will automatically start up on boot. Here I test it out on Prometheus:</p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/9_Systemd_services__Createservice/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><h2>10. Bash scripting - <a href="https://github.com/carltheperson/10-Things-Linux/tree/master/10_Bash_scripting__Penguin_cipher">Penguin cipher</a></h2><p>Bash scripting is something I have been avoiding for a long time. Partly because I believe that my programming language of choice, Go, is almost as handy when it comes to scripting, and partly because I think that Bash syntax looks horrible. Can’t knock it till you try it, so here I am trying to learn Bash scripting.</p><p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/67469/the-beginners-guide-to-shell-scripting-the-basics/">This</a> was a nice introduction, and after finding <a href="https://devhints.io/bash">this</a> cool cheatsheet I felt comfortable trying to create a project.</p><p>The project ended up being a cipher program I called <em>Penguin cipher</em> after Linux’s mascot. It allows you to encrypt text into something like this: <em>MTExIDIxMSAzMTMgNDAyIDQ2OCA0NjQgMTU5IDI0MSAyMzAgMzY3IDM3NCA1MjYgMTM3IDIyMiAyOTUgMzYzIDQzNCA0MzUg</em></p><p><img src="https://carltheperson.com/media/10-things-linux/10_Bash_scripting__Penguin_cipher/screenshot.png" alt=""></p><hr><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/carltheperson">Twitter</a></p><div><p>Email me at: <!-- -->  </p><div><p>c</p><p>a</p><p>r</p><p>l</p><p>t</p><p>h</p><p>e</p><p>p</p><p>e</p><p>r</p><p>s</p><p>o</p><p>n</p><p>_</p><p>p</p><p>r</p><p>o</p><p>t</p><p>o</p><p>n</p><p>m</p><p>a</p><p>i</p><p>l</p><p>:</p><p>c</p><p>o</p><p>m</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Advanced phishing attacks are becoming <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank">increasingly commonplace</a>
with tools that allow attackers to harvest credentials, bypass Two-factor authentication (2FA), as well as run automated post-exploit scripts the instant you enter your credentials. This post takes a look at our journey towards releasing <strong>Phinn</strong>, the real-time phishing simulation proxy that sits at the core of the PhishDeck phishing simulation platform.</p><p>In recent years we have seen a dramatic surge and shift in the phishing landscape that we have not seen in a very long time. We now have open-source tools that make it far more accessible than ever before for attackers to set up phishing websites that are virtually indistinguishable from their original counterparts both visually and, more importantly, in their behaviour.</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Recently we chased a skilled red team in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AWS</a> that:</p><p>- bypassed MFA<br>- intercepted user sessions w/ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Evilginx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Evilginx</a><br>- deployed python-based backdoors on EC2 instances<br>- located key creds on Redshift db<br>- escalated privs via role assumptions</p><p>More details here: <a href="https://t.co/sf25Ovij3w">https://t.co/sf25Ovij3w</a></p></div>— Jon Hencinski (@jhencinski) <a href="https://twitter.com/jhencinski/status/1333808403400024065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2020</a></blockquote><p>With the adoption of 2FA (albeit somewhat slow) we increase the barrier of entry for attackers. Security vendors have been innovative with their drive towards WebAuthn/U2F solutions, however we see slower adoption in phishing simulation platforms to actively reflect advanced phishing and social engineering attacks to gauge the former’s effectiveness, particularly with WebAuthn being clearer and more precise. Anyone that operates in, or with, a security blue-team (i.e. defense) knows that time-saving and effective solutions are imperative to act as a counterbalance that they can rely on and use.</p><p>The security community has been phenomenal at open-sourcing multiple standalone tools and sharing their knowledge through <a href="https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/mfa-phishing-on-aws/" target="_blank">technical articles</a>
as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/glzq5yL8LCE" target="_blank">conference talks</a>
around real-time phishing. The primary objective of these tools are to act as standalone tools that form part of a red-team’s, security consultant’s or pentester’s toolkit during security engagements — harvesting user credentials, sessions and 2FA/MFA tokens as well as run post-exploit automation scripts.</p><p>As a phishing simulation platform, PhishDeck’s scope is different, and therefore has different requirements that need to be met, be that performance, scalability or safety. We could have simply turned to popular open-source real-time phishing tools such as <a href="https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2" target="_blank">EvilGinx2</a>
, <a href="https://github.com/drk1wi/Modlishka" target="_blank">Modlishka</a>
or <a href="https://github.com/muraenateam/muraena" target="_blank">Muraena</a>
and be done with it. However, since PhishDeck is not designed to run red-team exercises or penetration tests (or to be used maliciously), we wanted to make sure that our product is as safe as possible to use for both the person being targeted, and the organization running the simulation.</p><p>On top of this, being the first phishing simulation vendor to incorporate this type of simulation, we wanted to make sure using it was easy to use. This means it needed to be faster, more feature-rich and tightly-knit with the rest of the PhishDeck platform. Users need to be able to be able to simulate real-time phishing campaigns without having to host their own infrastructure, manage domains, or fiddle with HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.</p><p>When we initially started working on a real time phishing simulation proxy we had explored going down the route of developing a hard-fork of EvilGinx2 for a number of reasons.</p><ol><li>It’s open-source license was permissive for private and commercial use;</li><li>A lot of plumbing around service configuration (what EvilGinx2 refers to as phishlets), and Let’s Encrypt certificate generation was already implemented;</li><li>We could use and expand on community-written services, initially thinking it would develop into a fairly large template library without breaking compatibility with our hard-fork;</li><li>Merging with upstream from time to time would not be too difficult as the codebase was fairly small and updates weren’t <strong>too</strong> frequent (e.g. daily).</li></ol><p>We went ahead and developed a heavily stripped down version of EvilGinx2. Implementing some key functionality around client-side code injection (which the project now supports) and security validation via JWT tokens for our users. We also removed a lot of the built-in functionality–no victim sessions (i.e. session database), no interactive terminal, and no credential harvesting. Only the certificate generator and the HTTP phishing proxy.</p><p>As time went on, we started hitting some notable problems that were going to become more and more difficult to overcome, effectively making the hard-fork model unsustainable.</p><ol><li>Using the <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/" target="_blank">HTTP-01 challenge type</a>
for TLS certificate generation heavily limited what type of services we could proxy. Our aim was to be able to proxy services that operate on wildcard subdomains (e.g. <code>*.slack.com</code>) that are exceptionally popular and make for very convincing phishing simulations. Achieving this requires us to move to the DNS-01 challenge type, but also requires the service configuration and core proxy to be “wildcard-aware” which is no small feat.</li><li>Community service configurations (i.e. phishlets) didn’t pick up at the frequency that we had originally anticipated. We really wanted to contribute more here, but found ourselves spending too much time on the proxy and very little on adding new services.</li><li>We ended up deviating heavily from upstream, including the core proxy. Merging ended up being a very arduous and manual process, particularly with breaking schema changes around service configurations.</li></ol><p>Key takeaway for us here, as most people in the software industry already know, is that maintaining a hard-fork is difficult. With that said, if we had to go back and face the same decision, we would have proceeded in the same direction. The EvilGinx2 hard-fork was a fantastic proof-of-value and really allowed us to prototype our ideas in the context of a larger phishing simulation platform and gauge our market fit better.</p><p>With a working prototype and a handful of lessons learnt, we went back to the drawing board and fleshed out the requirements for a new in-house proxy. One that is tightly integrated with PhishDeck. We love naming things and our namespace is ripe for all sorts of word play, so we named our new real-time phishing proxy, <strong>Phinn</strong>.</p><p>We came up with a few notable requirements that we had to achieve in order to provide value as well as scale our platform to the general public.</p><ul><li><strong>Wildcard DNS support</strong>. We want to be able to support wildcard domains to be able ro simulate realistic, targeted attacks against a variety of services.</li><li><strong>Performant</strong>. Since we are effectively mirroring/replaying traffic, we are duplicating our response times, making it less likely for Targets to engage with the phishing website and making it costlier for us to operate. Additionally, each PhishDeck user on average will translate to tens or hundreds of Targets, resulting in substantial increase of our proxy traffic when contrasted to our platform traffic.</li><li><strong>Safety</strong>. The objective for Phinn is to <strong>only</strong> proxy traffic for legitimate Targets that form part of a <strong>verified</strong> phishing simulation Campaign and to track specific events with the least amount of event metadata. We <strong>do not</strong> want to process, store or use any user sessions or credentials.</li></ul><p>The scope of the initial proxy was to come up with a crude real-time phishing proxy implementation to gauge the practical soundness of the idea.</p><p>We managed to get a working prototype going over HTTP (no TLS) within a day or so, applied some synthetic HTTP load and monitored CPU/memory usage. Everything fell within our required parameters and so we started laying out the tracks for what version 1.0 would look like. We had to future-proof the design as much as possible as we knew we would not be implementing all features right off the bat.</p><p>We needed to lay the foundations that would serve us for future improvements over the coming years.
The first key design artefact we committed to was the high-level sequence of what a successful proxied request behaves like. This is helpful as it helps better visualise the traffic replay aspect of the proxy and allows us to break down the implementation into smaller segments.</p><p><img src="https://www.phishdeck.com/blog/phinn-on-engineering-a-real-time-phishing-simulation-proxy/proxy-traffic-sequence-flow.png#figure" alt="" title="real-time phishing simulation proxy traffic flow"></p><p>We also needed to factor-in how the phishing proxy would operate with the rest of the PhishDeck platform. It needs to perform as one holistic platform and needs to propagate data from the PhishDeck Campaign, to the Target via the Campaign’s phishing email, to Phinn, all the way back to the same PhishDeck Campaign (full circle).</p><p>After some tweaking and testing we settled on the following set of components. The following diagram may be quite heavy, but I encourage you to take some time and grasp it segment by segment, using the flow markers (i.e. numbers) as your guide.</p><p><img src="https://www.phishdeck.com/blog/phinn-on-engineering-a-real-time-phishing-simulation-proxy/phinn-component-view.png#figure" alt="" title="PhishDeck real-time phishing simulation proxy component view"></p><p><strong>Note</strong> – The way we designed our Callback tokens (step 5 above) are similar to how <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/87338/in-oauth-what-is-the-benefit-of-the-access-token-being-opaque">opaque tokens</a> work in certain OAuth flows. We pack the metadata internally and only push an opaque Callback token (i.e. reference) to the Target. This suits our needs well as it avoids us ever having to pass sensitive Target metadata (e.g. email) over the wire.</p><p>In the platform, we are then able to show interesting metrics and charts for that specific Campaign, specifically the <em>Linked Clicked</em> and <em>Credentials Entered</em> data points, which are two distinct callback tokens that fire in the Target’s browser depending on their activity.</p><p><img src="https://www.phishdeck.com/blog/phinn-on-engineering-a-real-time-phishing-simulation-proxy/phishdeck-campaign-funnel.png#screenshot" alt="" title="PhishDeck Campaign funnel"></p><p>These designs were originally a lot less neat, primarily consisting of whiteboard drafts formalized into interim architecture design records (ADRs). Having such documentation in place early can be invaluable, particularly for software projects with a well-defined problem definition upfront. They act as our north star and allow us to break down seemingly complicated problems into multiple smaller problems to be solved.</p><p>We always eyed Rust as the primary candidate for the new phishing proxy. In the security world, being able to have performance and safety in the same box is rare and Rust fits that to a tee. The largest single defining factor establishing the move to Rust for the core …</p></div></div>

        <h2>How is exploding app growth affecting consumer behavior?</h2>
<p>The mobile app economy is expected to double by 2024 and reach a staggering <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/mobile-app-spending-to-double-by-2024-despite-economic-impacts-of-covid-19/#:~:text=For%20starters%2C%20global%20spending%20in,year%20to%20hit%20%24102%20billion.">$171 billion</a></strong>. That’s roughly the value of the entire <strong><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MCD/mcdonalds/market-cap">McDonald’s Corporation</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Is your company looking to carve out a piece of that multi-billion-dollar pie?</p>
<p>With nearly <strong><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-many-apps-in-app-store-2000252">2 million apps</a></strong> available in Apple’s App Store and <strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1020964/apple-app-store-app-releases-worldwide/#:~:text=Number%20of%20monthly%20Apple%20App%20Store%20app%20releases%20worldwide%202020&amp;text=This%20statistic%20shows%20the%20average,through%20the%20Apple%20App%20Store.">30,000 more</a></strong> added every month, so is everyone else.</p>
<p>We wanted to know how the app economy’s exploding growth is affecting consumer behavior, so we surveyed smartphone users to find out.</p>
<p>Specifically, as more brands launch and promote their own mobile apps, we wanted to know how users feel when they’re required to install these apps to place an order, use a product or try a service.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Did they find it frustrating?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How likely were they to install the app?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How regularly do they delete apps?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does deleting an app affect their opinion of a brand?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our research uncovered 11 app statistics that highlight significant customer pain points with the current state of mobile transactions. Going forward, companies must find solutions to these pain points. Those that don’t risk suffering both decreased market share and irrelevance.</p>
<p>With iOS 14, Apple is giving businesses a solution: <strong>App Clips.</strong></p>
<p>App Clips are small, lightweight portions of your full app that isolate a specific functionality and offer it to users as needed. They integrate seamlessly into tasks mobile users already are performing—such as browsing the web, searching for location-based recommendations or scanning visual tags—and offer brands organic opportunities to step in and provide value.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to rise above the noise in today’s overcrowded mobile app landscape, Apple iOS 14’s new App Clips are a no-brainer.</p>
<p>These 11 app statistics illustrate why.</p>

        <h3>The Take-Home Message</h3>
<p>Let’s recap what the data tells us about the current mobile app-related purchasing experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>68.5% of mobile phone users are moderately or extremely frustrated when they’re required to install an app to complete a transaction.</strong></li>
<li><strong>77.9% report abandoning a transaction because they didn’t want to install a required app.</strong></li>
<li><strong>30.3% say they’ve saved at least $100 in the last year by abandoning these transactions, with 7.8% saving at least $500.</strong></li>
<li><strong>58.5% who ultimately decide to install the required app still find the whole experience moderately or extremely frustrating and are 65.2% more likely to clean out their app inventory by deleting apps every week.</strong></li>
<li><strong>31.6% say deleting an app makes them think less of the company that created the app.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Where Apps Are Falling Short Today</h3>
<p>Those app statistics paint a clear picture and highlight three purchase-related pain points and inefficiencies:</p>
<p><strong>1. Astounding numbers of abandoned transactions due to that frustration </strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Increasing user demand for mobile apps</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Persistent and pervasive consumer frustration with current app-driven checkout processes</strong></p>
<p>Add all that up, and there’s an obvious and growing reservoir of unmet demand waiting to be tapped by businesses that can create seamless online purchasing experiences that facilitate instead of frustrate.</p>
<blockquote>iOS App Clips presents businesses with a high-impact way to increase mobile app downloads, build positive brand sentiment and increase customer engagement by leveraging the functionality currently built into their mobile app.</blockquote>

<h4>iOS 14 is Empowering Brands</h4>
<p>With the introduction of App Clips in iOS 14, Apple is giving businesses a way to do just that by enabling organic, frustration-free, app-powered checkout processes. Now, businesses can embed select portions of their full mobile app’s functionality for customers to interact with natively without requiring installation.</p>
<p>This addresses all three of those pain points and inefficiencies:</p>
<p><strong>1.Customers aren’t required to install an app to complete their transaction and enjoy a smooth, positive experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.Businesses capture more sales. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3.Customers associate their positive experience with both the business’s mobile app and brand, making them more likely to install the full app for future transactions.</strong></p>
<p>iOS App Clips presents companies with a high-impact way to increase mobile app downloads, build positive brand sentiment and increase customer engagement by leveraging the functionality currently built into their mobile app.</p>
<p>And for businesses that don’t have a mobile app but want to take advantage of App Clips to create a customer-centric experience, now is the perfect time to design, build and launch an app with App Clips in mind.</p>

		<h3>Metadata  will be the foundation for data governance solutions, data catalogs, and other enterprise data systems.</h3>
<p><strong>By Assaf Araki and Ben Lorica.</strong></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As companies embrace digital technologies to transform their operations and products, many are using best-of-breed software, open source tools, and software as a service (SaaS) platforms to rapidly and efficiently integrate new technologies. This often means that data required for reports, analytics, and machine learning (ML) reside on disparate systems and platforms. As such, IT initiatives in companies increasingly involve tools and frameworks for data fusion and integration. Examples include tools for building data pipelines, data quality and data integration solutions, customer data platform (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_data_platform">CDP</a>) , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management">master data management</a>, and <a href="https://gradientflow.com/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning/">data markets</a>.</p>
<p>Collecting, unifying, preparing, and managing data from diverse sources and formats has become imperative in this era of rapid digital transformation. Organizations that invest in <a href="https://gradientflow.com/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies/">foundational data technologies</a> are much more likely to build solid foundation applications, ranging from BI and analytics to machine learning and AI.</p>
<p>In recent years, several technology companies developed internal metadata management systems and shared the challenges that led them to focus on metadata (this list includes: Airbnb’s <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/democratizing-data-at-airbnb-852d76c51770">Dataportal</a>, Netflix’s <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/metacat">Metacat</a>, Uber’s <a href="https://eng.uber.com/databook/">Databook</a>, LinkedIn’s <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/datahub">Datahub</a>, Lyft’s <a href="https://www.amundsen.io/">Amundsen</a>, WeWork’s <a href="https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez">Marquez</a>, Spotify’s <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/02/27/how-we-improved-data-discovery-for-data-scientists-at-spotify/">Lexikon</a>). These companies were facing fragmented data landscapes, while growing teams of analysts, data scientists, and engineers were needing to build data and machine learning products. The blog posts announcing these metadata management tools made it clear that these companies have come to rely on these metadata systems to power an array of data and machine learning services.</p>
<p>Beyond the need to unify and tame data from diverse systems, other reasons for the resurgence in interest in metadata technologies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regulations like <a href="https://gradientflow.com/managing-machine-learning-in-the-enterprise-lessons-from-banking-and-health-care/">SR-11</a>, GDPR, and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) require organizations to manage data privacy, access, and control efficiently and at scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Debugging and root cause analysis are essential for machine learning and AI applications. The advent of new regulations raises the possibility of audits, making tools for data governance, model governance, and data lineage particularly critical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data governance at scale requires a certain level of automation, especially when many different software systems and platforms are involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data discovery is particularly important for productivity reasons. Many users spend significant time finding and understanding the right data. A good data discovery product can help in this regard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we examine emerging tools for managing metadata and data governance. A CxO or a VP of R&amp;D might ask themselves why they need a metadata management system at all: are existing data governance and data catalog solutions not adequate? We argue that solutions built on top of metadata management systems result in data governance systems that are global in scope. Metadata management systems provide end-to-end data governance solutions that cover source systems, data warehouses, data management systems, and data pipelines that power enterprise applications. Advanced data protection techniques including masking, differential privacy, data synthesis can be integrated. The resulting data catalogs will be comprehensive, and changes will immediately be reflected in dependency mappings between data assets. As a result, users (analysts, data scientists, and engineers) will be able to search and discover trustworthy data that complies with internal and external regulations.</p>

<p>The first layer, unified schema, is for collecting data into a unified platform. Metadata needs to be collected from all systems, including operational systems, analytics systems, and other software. This layer has three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Extract, load, transform (ELT) </strong>– Depending on how ELT is implemented, data collection can be done using a push (changes and updates are sent automatically) or pull (metadata ELT periodically extracts changes or updates) mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refinement and storage </strong>– A data management system stores all the metadata data in a format that will be easy to retrieve. Linkedin, for example, found that a “<a href="https://pardhugunnam.medium.com/announcing-metaphor-data-c86170c81202">knowledge graph of metadata</a> unleashed many services and applications.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access </strong>– APIs or domain-specific languages for extracting data from the metadata system are used to build the upper layers, Data Catalog and Governance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2015, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/10/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services.html">academic researchers began pointing out</a> the potential applications of metadata management systems for data governance and other areas of data management. As we noted, several technology companies have built systems to begin realizing this vision. Recent posts by teams behind metadata management systems at <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/data-hub">Linkedin</a> and <a href="https://www.amundsen.io/">Lyft</a> highlight the power of providing users with tools for discovering, accessing, and consuming trusted data. At Linkedin, a metadata management system <a href="https://pardhugunnam.medium.com/announcing-metaphor-data-c86170c81202">“powers numerous mission-critical use cases</a>.”</p>
<p>The second layer, Data Catalog, organizes data into an informative, searchable, and trusted inventory of all data assets. A Data Catalog has the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data description </strong>– A detailed description, including summaries, of all data elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data lineage </strong>– Dataflow for the origin and evolution of data. In large organizations with multiple levels of data dependencies, for example, change management and communication with downstream users is a challenge that can be addressed with a knowledge graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data version control </strong>– A system responsible for tracking changes in datasets over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data usage </strong>– Tracking data usage and consumption by human users or by applications and systems. Data usage includes the ability to observe the actual flow of data in an organization. Data usage and consumption tracking can also help build cost-management solutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The final layer, Governance, manages the availability, integrity, and security of data in enterprise systems, based on internal data standards and policies that control data usage. Effective data governance ensures that data is consistent and trustworthy, and doesn’t get misused. This layer has four components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data discovery </strong>– A service that includes detecting sensitive data across all data platforms, saving time and limiting risk from manual errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data protection </strong>– A collection of techniques to reduce the unnecessary spread and exposure of sensitive data while simultaneously maintaining its usability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data access management </strong>– A fine-grained access control on the cell level that maintains adherence to organizational policy and regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data quality </strong>– The accuracy, completeness, consistency, and relevance of data. Data quality tools help assess quality and fix issues in data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Snapshot of Companies</h2>
<p>Below is a partial list of companies that have solutions in the three building block layers we described. In this graphic, a company or an open source project that appears in one of the layers may only address a subset of the components in that layer. Moreover, some companies span multiple layers, but for the sake of space and clarity, we opted not to place them in all the layers for which they potentially have solutions.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this post, we describe a new set of metadata management systems and how they will impact data governance solutions, data catalogs, and other enterprise data systems. We close this post with the following observations about the future of metadata management solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A couple of startups already focus on metadata management, and we expect <a href="https://medium.com/knowledge-technologies/review-metadata-day-2020-e38c28c4cf1a">more companies to follow</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We believe metadata management systems will be the foundation for many data management applications, as outlined in Figure 2 above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As AI and data applications increasingly rely on disparate data sources, data governance solutions must be global in scope—in other words, end-to-end data governance solutions that cover source systems, data warehouses, data management systems, and data pipelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s important to emphasize that business value lies in global data governance, which can be best achieved through a unified schema.</p>
</li>

<p><em>I had wrote this before the Unleashed was revealed, so some of the bits on economics have changed. As of writing this, I still stand by my other beliefs. </em>One of the most hyped things in hardware design is RISC-V, the open ISA available without license fees. Many organizations including <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/company/innovations/risc-v">Western Digital</a> have pledged support for RISC-V, and the open source community has a lot of faith in it, and with <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16080/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion">Nvidia’s recent purchase of Arm</a>, people are concerned. However, I feel these hopes are somewhat misleading, as RISC-V’s openness is less at the benefit of the user and more for CPU vendors.</p>

<p><strong>Royalties</strong>. One of the biggest benefits of RISC-V is not having to pay any royalties for a CPU using it. You might pay SiFive or someone else for a realization of their cores on hard silicon, but that’s for the design, not an abstract implementation of the ISA. Openness here means there’s more profit margin on the tiny chips running washing machines, since they don’t have to pay ARM or Synopsys. While the savings could be passed onto you, the ISA’s openness will never be of concern when the program is on a one-time-programmable ROM.</p>



<p><strong>ISA fragmentation</strong>. RISC-V intentionally defines a small ISA with extensions (for example, multiplication, which actually encompasses divide too… which is even more expensive to implement than multiply, but it’s a package deal). While most larger implementations will implement a common set of extensions, having basic functionality in extensions could make software compatibility for binary distributions harder. This is made worse by RISC-V explicitly encouraging custom instructions for task-specific tweaks on vendor silicon – great for embedded, not so hot for general purpose computers and operating systems supporting them.</p>



<p><strong>Economics</strong>. RISC-V has actively courted embedded, which makes sense as a niche. Much of the hype of RISC-V is hoping for laptop/desktop/server class silicon. This is unlikely, because the economics of embedded are different. ISA doesn’t matter as much in embedded programming (code reuse matters, but it’s not like you’re running arbitrary binaries), whereas user/enterprise focused computing usually lives and dies by binary compatibility (to protect investments in existing applications) and performance gained by things most RISC-V implementations don’t have yet like superscalar execution (To say nothing how these impact implementation complexity and security!).</p>



<p><strong>Openness doesn’t tickle down</strong>. The openness of an ISA doesn’t have much impact on the implementation. A design with restricted signing keys is completely acceptable under their licensing – and is very likely, considering the embedded dominance RISC-V is likely to have. There are no guarantees of openness in ways that impact a user (i.e controlling the root of trust), since a user doesn’t exactly have access to a fab.</p>



<p><strong>Design flaws</strong>. RISC-V seems like it hasn’t learned anything from CPUs designed after 1991. Between some <a href="https://gist.github.com/erincandescent/8a10eeeea1918ee4f9d9982f7618ef68">rookie mistakes</a> like few <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/yqqhxu/llvm_for_m68k_completed_not_merged">addressing modes</a> (register churn, code density) and <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/icegvf/will_risc_v_revolutionize_computing#c_8wbb6t">blowing out the encoding space</a>. However, despite its flaws, it’s poised to take over embedded and possibly beyond anyways – worse truly is better.</p>



<p>Overall, RISC-V will lead in a revolution for nationalist vanity CPUs (think Loongson; no one will run them but for show and perhaps a niche of radical ideologues) , academic projects, and embedded vendors wanting to save on their balance sheets, but it probably won’t affect users or developers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>This is the first post in a series on asynchronous programming. The whole series tries to answer a simple question: "What is asynchrony?". In the beginning, when I first started digging into the question, I thought I knew what it is. It turned out that I didn't know the slightest thing about asynchrony. So let's find out!</p>
<p>Whole series:</p>

<li><a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/asynchronous-programming-python3.5">Asynchronous programming. Python3.5+</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we will be talking about networking but you can easily map it to other input/output(I/O) operations, for example, change sockets to file descriptors. Also, this explanation is not focusing on any specific programming language although the examples will be given in Python(what can I say – I love Python!).<span data-ez-name="luminousmen_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>
<hr>
<p>One way or another, when you have a question about blocking or non-blocking calls, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/">most commonly it means dealing with I/O</a>. The most frequent case in our age of information, microservices, and lambda functions will be request processing. We can immediately imagine that you, dear reader, are a user of a web site, while your browser (or the application where you're reading these lines) is a client. Somewhere in the depths of the Amazon, there is a server that handles your incoming requests to generate the same lines that you're reading.</p>
<p>In order to start an interaction in such client-server communications, the client and the server must first establish a connection with each other. We will not go into the depths of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">7-layer model</a> and the protocol stack that is involved in this interaction, as I think it all can be easily found on the Internet. What we need to understand is that on both sides (client and server) there are special connection points known as sockets. Both the client and server must be bound to each other's sockets, and listen to them to understand what the other says on the opposite side of the wire.<span data-ez-name="luminousmen_com-box-4"></span></p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/asynchronous-programming-blocking-and-non-blocking/asynchronous-programming-blocking-and-non-blocking-1.jpg" alt="Client-server communication"></p>
<p>In our communication, the server doing something — either processes the request, converts markdown to HTML or looks where the images are, it performs some kind of processing.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/latency-of-events.png" alt="CPU speed and network speed"></p>
<p>If you look at the ratio between CPU speed and network speed, the difference is a couple of orders of magnitude. It turns out that if our application uses I/O most of the time, in most cases the processor simply does nothing. This type of application is called I/O-bound. For applications that require high performance, it is a bottleneck, and that is what we will talk about next.</p>
<p>There are two ways to organize I/O (I will give examples based on Linux): <strong>blocking</strong> and <strong>non-blocking</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, there are two types of I/O operations: synchronous and asynchronous.</p>
<p>All together they represent possible I/O models.</p>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/asynchronous-programming-blocking-and-non-blocking/asynchronous-programming-blocking-and-non-blocking-3.JPG" alt="I/O models"></p>
<p>Each of these I/O models has usage patterns that are advantageous for particular applications. Here I will demonstrate the difference between the two ways of organizing I/O.</p>
<h2>Blocking I/O</h2>
<p>With the blocking I/O, when the client makes a connection request to the server, the socket processing that connection and the corresponding thread that reads from it is blocked until some read data appears. This data is placed in the network buffer until it is all read and ready for processing. Until the operation is complete, the <strong>server can do nothing more but wait</strong>.</p>
<p>The simplest conclusion from this is that we cannot serve more than one connection within a single thread. By default, TCP sockets work in blocking mode.</p>
<p>A simple example on Python, client:</p>
<pre><code>import socket
import sys
import time


def main() -&gt; None:
    host = socket.gethostname()
    port = 12345

    # create a TCP/IP socket
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
        while True:
            sock.connect((host, port))
            while True:
                data = str.encode(sys.argv[1])
                sock.send(data)
                time.sleep(0.5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert len(sys.argv) &gt; 1, "Please provide message"
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Here we send a message with 50ms interval to the server in the endless loop. Imagine that this client-server communication consist of downloading a big file — it takes some time to finish.</p>
<p>And the server:</p>
<pre><code>import socket


def main() -&gt; None:
    host = socket.gethostname()
    port = 12345
    
    # create a TCP/IP socket
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
        # bind the socket to the port
        sock.bind((host, port))
        # listen for incoming connections
        sock.listen(5)
        print("Server started...")

        while True:
            conn, addr = sock.accept()  # accepting the incoming connection, blocking
            print('Connected by ' + str(addr))
            while True:
                data = conn.recv(1024)  # receving data, blocking
                if not data: 
                    break
                print(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>I am running this in separate terminal windows with several clients as:</p>
<pre><code>$ python client.py "client N"
</code></pre>
<p>And server as:</p>
<pre><code>$ python server.py
</code></pre>
<p>Here we just listen to the socket and accept incoming connections. Then we try to receive data from this connection.</p>
<p>In the above code, the server will essentially be blocked by a single client connection! If we run another client with another message, you will not see it. I highly recommend that you play with this example to understand what is happening.</p>
<p><em>What is going on here?</em></p>
<p>The <code>send()</code> method will try to send all data to the server while the write buffer on the server will continue to receive data. When the system call for reading is called, the application is blocked and the context is switched to the kernel. The kernel initiates reading - the data is transferred to the user-space buffer. When the buffer becomes empty, the kernel will wake up the process again to receive the next portion of data to be transferred.</p>
<p>Now in order to handle two clients with this approach, we need to have several threads, i.e. to allocate a new thread for each client connection. We will get back to that soon.</p>

<h2>Non-blocking I/O</h2>
<p>However, there is also a second option — <strong>non-blocking I/O</strong>. The difference is obvious from its name — instead of blocking, any operation is executed immediately. Non-blocking I/O means that the request is immediately queued and the function is returned. The actual I/O is then processed at some later point.</p>
<p>By setting a socket to a non-blocking mode, you can effectively interrogate it. If you try to read from a non-blocking socket and there is no data, it will return an error code (<code>EAGAIN</code> or <code>EWOULDBLOCK</code>).</p>
<p>Actually, this polling type is a bad idea. If you run your program in a constant cycle of polling data from the socket, it will consume expensive CPU time. This can be extremely inefficient because in many cases the application must busy-wait until the data is available or attempt to do other work while the command is performed in the kernel. A more elegant way to check if the data is readable is using <code>select()</code>.<span data-ez-name="luminousmen_com-leader-1"></span></p>
<p>Let us go back to our example with the changes on the server:</p>
<pre><code>import select
import socket


def main() -&gt; None:
    host = socket.gethostname()
    port = 12345

    # create a TCP/IP socket
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
        sock.setblocking(0)
        # bind the socket to the port
        sock.bind((host, port))
        # listen for incoming connections
        sock.listen(5)
        print("Server started...")

        # sockets from which we expect to read
        inputs = [sock]
        outputs = []

        while inputs:
            # wait for at least one of the sockets to be ready for processing
            readable, writable, exceptional = select.select(inputs, outputs, inputs)

            for s in readable:
                if s is sock:
                    conn, addr = s.accept()
                    inputs.append(conn)
                else:
                    data = s.recv(1024)
                    if data:
                        print(data)
                    else:
                        inputs.remove(s)
                        s.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Now if we run this code with &gt;1 clients you will see that the server is not blocked by a single client and it handles everything that can be detected by the messages displayed. Again, I suggest that you try this example yourself.</p>
<p><em>What's going on here?</em></p>
<p>Here the server does not wait for all the data to be written to the buffer. When we make a socket non-blocking by calling <code>setblocking(0)</code>, it will never wait for the operation to be completed. So when we call the <code>recv</code> method, it will return to the main thread. The main mechanical difference is that <code>send</code>, <code>recv</code>, <code>connect</code> and <code>accept</code> can return without doing anything at all.</p>
<p>With this approach, we can perform multiple I/O operations with different sockets from the same thread concurrently. But since we don't know if a socket is ready for an I/O operation, we would have to ask each socket with the same question and essentially spin in an infinite loop (this non-blocking but the still synchronous approach is called I/O multiplexing).</p>
<p>To get rid of this inefficient loop, we need <strong>polling readiness mechanism</strong>. In this mechanism, we could interrogate the readiness of all sockets, and they would tell us which one is ready for the new I/O operation and which one is not without being explicitly asked. When any of the sockets is ready, we will perform operations in the queue and then be able to return to the blocking state, waiting for the sockets to be ready for the next I/O operation.</p>
<p>There are several polling readiness mechanisms, they are different in performance and detail, but usually, the details are hidden "under the hood" and not visible to us.</p>

<p>On January 27th, starting at 4:31UTC we were hit with increasing amounts of traffic from what appeared to be hundreds of different IP addresses mostly belonging to Amazon Web Service IP addresses. At 8:46UTC the inbound traffic overwhelmed our systems and brought nearly all of our services to a standstill.</p>



<p>After investigating the situation and receiving no meaningful assistance from Hetzner (our ISP who advertises DDoS mitigation services as part of their offerings) we blocked three subnets of IP addresses in order to restore our services. At 13:14UTC we put the block in place and our services started recovering.</p>



<p>We reported the issue to Hetzner and to AWS shortly after restoring our service. The next morning we received a friendly email from Andy, who works for one of our supporters at <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">Plex</a>, stating that they received a complaint from AWS. What happened next and how this matter was resolved is told by Andy himself:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Overnight on Wednesday, first thing Thursday morning, we received an abuse report that our servers were flooding an IP that corresponded to musicbrainz.org. We scrambled to investigate, as we are happy MusicBrainz partners, but it was a strange report because we run our MusicBrainz server and hit that instance rather than communicating with musicbrainz.org directly. And the IPs mentioned were specifically related to our metadata servers, not the IPs that would be receiving data updates from upstream. Just as some of our key engineering team members were starting to wake up and scrub in, it started to seem that it was a coincidence and we weren’t the actual source of the traffic and had simply been caught up in an overeager blocking of a large IP range to get the services back up. Never trust a coincidence. We continued to stay in touch with the team at MusicBrainz and within a few hours we had clear evidence that our IPs were the source of the traffic. We got the whole engineering team involved again to do some investigation, and we still couldn’t figure much out since we never make requests to musicbrainz.org and we had already worked to rule out the potential of any rogue access to our servers. By isolating our services and using our monitoring tools, we finally discovered that the issue was actually our traffic to coverartarchive.org, not musicbrainz.org, as they happen to be serviced by the same IP address. And this made much more sense, as we do depend on some API calls to the Cover Art Archive.</em></p><p><em>The root cause was an update to the Plex Media Server which had been released earlier in the week. There was a bug in that update that caused extra metadata requests to our own infrastructure. We had noticed the spike in our autoscaling to accommodate the extra traffic and already put together another update to fix the bug. That extra traffic on our infrastructure also translated to a more modest increase in requests to some of our metadata partners, including CAA. While the fix was already rolling out to Plex Media Servers, this provided a good opportunity to evaluate the CAA traffic and put our own rate limit in place to protect against future issues. We wrapped up that change in the afternoon on Thursday.</em></p><p><em>Throughout the ordeal, we appreciated the communication back and forth with our partners at MusicBrainz so that we could work together to investigate and follow leads to find a timely resolution.</em></p><cite>Andy from Plex</cite></blockquote>



<p>While this whole situation was very stressful and frustrating to us, in the end it was resolved by a very friendly and technical detective game to identify and resolve the issue. It is always nice when geeks talk to geeks to resolve issues and get services working again. Thank you to Andy and his team — let’s hope we can avoid an issue like this in the future.</p>



<p>We’d apologize for the trouble caused by our IP address block and for our services being unavailable for several hours.</p>



<p>EDIT: We should also mention that all of our services are served from one single gateway IP address, so coverartarchive.org and musicbrainz.org have the same IP address.</p>

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/development/examples/getting-started.ipynb"><img alt="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"></a></p><p>CompilerGym is a toolkit for applying reinforcement learning to compiler
optimization tasks. This document provides a short walkthrough of the key
concepts, using the codesize reduction task of a production-grade compiler
as an example. It will take about 20 minutes to work through. Lets get
started!</p>

<div id="key-concepts">
<h2><a href="#id3">Key Concepts</a><a href="#key-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CompilerGym exposes compiler optimization problems as environments for
reinforcement learning. It uses the <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a>
interface to expose the “agent-environment loop” of reinforcement learning:</p>
<p><img alt="_images/overview.png" src="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/_images/overview.png"></p><p>The ingredients for reinforcement learning that CompilerGym provides are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environment</strong>: a compiler optimization task. For example,
<em>optimizing a C++ graph-traversal program for codesize using LLVM</em>. The
environment encapsulates an instance of a compiler and a particular program
that is being compiled. As an agent interacts with the environment, the state
of the program, and the compiler, can change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action Space</strong>: the actions that may be taken at the current environment
state. For example, this could be a set of optimization transformations that
the compiler can apply to the program.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation</strong>: a view of the current environment state. For example, this
could be the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program that is being
compiled. The types of observations that are available depend on the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward</strong>: a metric indicating the quality of the previous action. For
example, for a codesize optimization task this could be the change to the
number of instructions of the previous action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A single instance of this “agent-environment loop” represents the compilation of
a particular program. The goal is to develop an agent that maximises the
cumulative reward from these environments so as to produce the best programs.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation">
<h2><a href="#id4">Installation</a><a href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Install the latest CompilerGym release using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ pip install compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The binary works on macOS and Linux (on Ubuntu 18.04, Fedora 28, Debian
10 or newer equivalents).</p>
<div id="building-from-source">
<h3><a href="#id5">Building from Source</a><a href="#building-from-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you prefer, you may build from source. This requires a modern C++
toolchain. On macOS you can use the system compiler. On linux, install
the required toolchain using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ sudo apt install clang libtinfo5 patchelf
$ export CC=clang
$ export CXX=clang++
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We recommend using
<a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/">conda</a>
to manage the remaining build dependencies. First create a conda
environment with the required dependencies:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ conda create -n compiler_gym python=3.8 bazel=3.1.0 cmake pandoc
$ conda activate compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then clone the CompilerGym source code using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym.git
$ cd CompilerGym
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Install the python development dependencies using:</p>

<p>Then run the test suite to confirm that everything is working:</p>

<p>To build and install the python package, run:</p>

<p>When you are finished, you can deactivate and delete the conda
environment using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ conda deactivate
$ conda env remove -n compiler_gym
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="using-compilergym">
<h2><a href="#id6">Using CompilerGym</a><a href="#using-compilergym" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Begin by firing up a python interpreter:</p>

<p>To start with we import the gym module and the CompilerGym environments:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> <span>gym</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>import</span> <span>compiler_gym</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Importing <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/compiler_gym.html#module-compiler_gym" title="compiler_gym"><code><span>compiler_gym</span></code></a> automatically registers the compiler environments.</p>
<p>We can see what environments are available using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>compiler_gym</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILER_GYM_ENVS</span>
<span>['llvm-v0', 'llvm-ic-v0', 'llvm-autophase-ic-v0', 'llvm-ir-ic-v0']</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div id="selecting-an-environment">
<h3><a href="#id7">Selecting an environment</a><a href="#selecting-an-environment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>CompilerGym environments are named using one of the following formats:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;observation&gt;-&lt;reward&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;reward&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;-&lt;version&gt;</span></code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Where <code><span>&lt;compiler&gt;</span></code> identifiers the compiler optimization task,
<code><span>&lt;observation&gt;</span></code> is the default type of observations that are provided,
and <code><span>&lt;reward&gt;</span></code> is the reward signal.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A key concept is that
CompilerGym environments enables <strong>lazy evaluation</strong> of observations and
reward signals. This makes the environment much more computationally
efficient for scenarios in which you do not need to compute a reward or
observation for every step. If an environment omits a <code><span>&lt;observation&gt;</span></code>
or <code><span>&lt;reward&gt;</span></code> tag, this means that no observation or reward is
provided by default. See <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/views.html"><span>compiler_gym.views</span></a> for
further details.</p>
</div>
<p>For this tutorial, we will use the following environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compiler</strong>: <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html"><span>LLVM</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Observation Type</strong>: <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#autophase"><span>Autophase</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward Signal</strong>: <a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#codesize"><span>IR Instruction count relative to -Oz</span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Create an instance of this environment using:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>env</span> <span>=</span> <span>gym</span><span>.</span><span>make</span><span>(</span><span>"llvm-autophase-ic-v0"</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="installing-benchmarks">
<h3><a href="#id8">Installing benchmarks</a><a href="#installing-benchmarks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A compiler requires a program as input. For the purposes of CompilerGym we call
these input programs <em>benchmarks</em>, and collections of benchmarks are assembled
into <em>datasets</em>. You may provide your own programs to use as benchmarks, or
download one of our pre-assembled datasets.</p>
<p>The benchmarks that are available to an environment can be queried using

<p>As you can see, there are no benchmarks installed by default. We have provided
a collection of pre-assembled
<a href="https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#datasets"><span>LLVM benchmark datasets</span></a> that can be

							<p><span>In what can be considered as the next step in the human quest for immortality, tech behemoth Microsoft has reportedly signed a patent titled “Creating a Conversational Chatbot of a Specific Person.”</span></p>
<p><span>The patent grants the company to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot that aims to emulate voices of the deceased loved ones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The creation of chatbot would rely on the personal information of a deceased person. </span></p>
<p><span>Social data, such as “images, voice data, social media posts, electronic messages, written letters, etc.” may also be accessed so that the AI could create an index that reflects the personality of the person being simulated.</span></p>

<p><span>It further adds, “The specific person may also correspond to oneself (e.g., the user creating/training the chat bot, ” insinuating that living users could create and train their own version of AI chatbot to be a digital replacement after they’re gone.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The company has even introduced the idea of generating 2D and 3D models based on images, depth information and video data associated with the specific person.

<p><span>The concept of simulating someone, who has passed, sounds something straight out of science fiction, and it’s certainly not a novelty.&nbsp; </span><span>If you have seen Netflix’s Black Mirror, its episode “Be Right Back” of Season 2 centers around the same exact premise, where a woman, whose recent death of her boyfriend had left her in great distress, seeks a service to bring an AI-powered chatbot version of her partner into her life.</span></p>
<p><span>Everyone has lost their dearly beloved, and at some point, wished they could have one last conversation with them. Microsoft maybe able to grant you something similar of that sort.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So how would you feel about having to have your dearly-departed loved one(s) immortalized?</p>

               <h3>
                  A discovery in theoretical physics could help to unravel the mysteries of dark matter
               </h3>
               <p>
                  1 February 2021
               </p>
               <p>
                  Theoretical physicists of the PRISMA<sup>+</sup>&nbsp;Cluster of Excellence at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU) are working on a theory that goes beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and can answer questions where the Standard Model has to pass – for example, with respect to the hierarchies of the masses of elementary particles or the existence of dark matter. The central element of the theory is an extra dimension in spacetime. Until now, scientists have faced the problem that the predictions of their theory could not be tested experimentally. They have now overcome this problem in a publication in the current issue of the <em>European Physical Journal C</em>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Already in the 1920s, in an attempt to unify the forces of gravity and electromagnetism, Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein speculated about the existence of an extra dimension beyond the familiar three space dimensions and time – which in physics are combined into 4-dimensional spacetime. If it exists, such a new dimension would have to be incredible tiny and unnoticeable to the human eye. In the late 1990s, this idea has seen a remarkable renaissance&nbsp;when it was realized that the existence of a fifth dimension could resolve some of the profound open questions of particle physics. In particular, Yuval Grossman of Stanford University and Matthias Neubert, then a professor at Cornell University in the US, showed in a highly cited publication that the embedding of the Standard Model of particle physics in a 5-dimensional spacetime could explain the so far mysterious patterns seen in the masses of elementary particles.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Another 20 years later, the group of Professor Matthias Neubert – since 2006 on the faculty of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and spokesperson of the PRISMA<sup>+</sup> Cluster of Excellence – made another unexpected discovery: they found that the 5-dimensional field equations predicted the existence of a new&nbsp;heavy particle with similar properties as the famous Higgs boson but a much heavier mass – so heavy, in fact, that it cannot be produced even at the highest-energy particle collider in the world,&nbsp;the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Center for Nuclear Research CERN near Geneva in Switzerland. "It was a nightmare,"&nbsp;recalled&nbsp;Javier Castellano Ruiz, a PhD student involved in the research.&nbsp;"We were excited by the idea that our theory predicts a new particle, but it appeared to be impossible to confirm this prediction in any foreseeable experiment."
               </p>
               <h4>
                  The detour through the fifth dimension
               </h4>
               <p>
                  In a recent paper published in the <em>European Physical Journal C</em>, the researchers found a spectacular resolution to this dilemma. They discovered that their proposed particle would necessarily mediate a new force between the known elementary particles of our visible universe&nbsp;and the mysterious dark matter, the dark sector. Even the abundance of dark matter in the cosmos, as observed in astrophysical experiments, can be explained by their theory. This offers exciting new ways to search for the constituents of the dark matter – literally via a detour through the extra dimension – and obtain clues about the physics at a very early stage in the history of our universe, when dark matter was produced. "After years of searching for possible confirmations of our theoretical predictions, we are now confident that the mechanism we have discovered would make dark matter accessible to forthcoming experiments, because the properties of the new interaction between ordinary matter and dark matter – which is mediated by our proposed particle – can be calculated accurately within our theory,"&nbsp;said Professor Matthias Neubert, head of the research team. "In the end – so our hope – the new particle may be discovered first through its interactions with the dark sector."&nbsp;This example nicely illustrates the fruitful interplay between experimental and theoretical basic science – a hallmark of the PRISMA<sup>+</sup> Cluster of Excellence.

<p><span>A</span>n Islamic<em> sohbet</em> is a little like a jazz gig, and its current master in Turkey is an imam named Ahmet in Cassocks. The Arabic-rooted word means “conversation,” but for Sufis, a sohbet consists of a lonely cleric sitting behind a lectern, pontificating, often for hours, before an audience that listens in reverent silence. Ahmet in Cassocks, the John Coltrane of sohbet sessions, has no problem captivating his 856,000 YouTube followers with his free-spirited, experimental rants that consider practical concerns of modernity through the ancient teachings of Islam. In a throaty voice that occasionally betrays a hint of sarcasm, he invokes the Quran<em> </em>and the hadith, a collection of Prophet Mohammad’s sayings and anecdotes. With his lustrous silver beard and wooden walking stick, Ahmet cuts a distinctive figure as he explodes the internet.</p>



<p>Ahmet’s sohbets, streamed online <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1HL4WPXNP1XovsUGrd771__CBqYuj2sy">every Thursday</a>, have attracted more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CubbeliAhmetHoca/about">200 million views</a> since he launched his YouTube channel in 2013. One might engage with Darwin’s theories; another will touch on the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. His most popular sohbet, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHJ5BtnekwY&amp;t=5s">watched 3.8 million times</a>, lasts just six minutes<em> </em>and ponders the religious implications of oral sex. In other videos, he recommends masturbation as a method to avoid the temptations of rape and questions whether handling a smartphone in the bathroom is religiously acceptable. (He claims that it is, as long as the user is reading <em>Ensonhaber</em>, a Turkish pro-government news site.) But most of his lectures are more subdued. In a recent three-hour sohbet, Ahmet riffed on inheritance law, trending topics on Twitter, and the financial strains Muslims face in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. All are free to view, though, in 2020, he tested a membership scheme: for roughly $4 a month (30 liras), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3QqKQIjA_MSjWnTpyByeGA/join">subscribers</a> to his YouTube channel received early access to new material and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgwScBj5DLCaBmpH9nx4AaABCQ">had emojis of Islamic flags</a> attached to their usernames.</p>



<p>As a leading spokesperson of Naqshbandi, one of the oldest and most powerful Islamic orders in history, Ahmet in Cassocks wields immense power. There are 30 main branches of Sufism active in Turkey today — Naqshbandi is one of them — and 400 sub-branches, including the community that Ahmet belongs to. In total, these branches, or tariqas, are believed to have 10 million followers, including the 8 million that Naqshbandi claims. Like the American evangelical pastor Rick Warren or the German guru Eckhart Tolle, these Sufi clerics devote their lives to authoring books, delivering speeches, and, if they’re truly successful, shaping public conversation. Islamic sects led by charismatic sheikhs and their appointed spokespersons have existed in Turkey, India, and Pakistan since at least the 12th century, but thanks to the internet and more recently the restrictions imposed by Covid-19, they have been enjoying a revival. To a global Muslim audience yearning for content and community, YouTube clerics offer the best of both worlds: spiritual wisdom enjoyed from the safety of one’s living room.</p>



<p>Turkish authorities have for centuries had a complicated relationship with Sufi clerics. In 1925, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of modern Turkey, announced a wholesale ban on Sufi sects, as their sites of worship had earned a reputation for being “brothels and wine houses,” in the words of one prominent sheikh. This attitude changed after a conservative opposition party came to power in 1950, and since then, Turkish leaders have not only been sympathetic to tariqas but often are quiet believers. The current health minister, for instance, is reportedly aligned with the İskenderpaşa order, and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is close to several Naqshbandi sheikhs. While the Turkish government will aggressively go after anybody it perceives to be an enemy, including academics and journalists, perhaps because of these ties, clerics have largely been spared.</p>



<p>This winter, religious-themed streaming content grew rapidly as Covid-19 raced around the world and restrictions on in-person gatherings became the norm. For some anxious Turks faith became a savior. In one national poll conducted last June by Istanbul’s İbn Haldun University, 86 percent of 3,070 interviewees reported using prayer and worship to deal with the fear, anxiety and stress brought about by the coronavirus. While Turks are about as religious as they have been for years, there are more opportunities to engage with religion than ever before. In part because of new technologies, “religion is more integrated into daily life,” Ismihan Simsek, a media commentator and author of&nbsp;<em>Popstar Islamic Preachers</em>, told me. She cited a study by Erciyes University which demonstrated that the internet has become a primary source of religious information, alongside books and family.</p>

</p><figcaption>Ahmet in Cassocks’s sohbets have attracted more than 200 million views since he launched his YouTube channel in 2013.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ekrem Süle, a medical supply salesman, is a 32-year-old follower of Ahmet. What he admires in the cleric is “his way of telling stories, his diction,” and the breadth of his knowledge about Islam. Süle stresses that Ahmet is <em>ehl-i sünnet</em>,<em> </em>an Islamic term that means someone belongs to a community that embraces a spiritual path. Harun Boyacı, another follower, has been enjoying Ahmet’s talks for the past 25 years. “His oratory is so beautiful and impressive,” he says, adding that his relationship with Islam has been “very much strengthened,” thanks to Ahmet’s talks. Cevahir Topaloğlu, a 19-year-old journalist who works as an editor at a local newspaper in the Black Sea city of Rize shared similar feelings but noted that he only allows himself to watch the cleric’s videos on his phone at night. “If we use our gadgets all day long for viewing sohbets, they’ll of course create addiction. We have to schedule our use,” says Topaloğlu, who said that his life changed after he began following Ahmet.</p>



<p>On social media, debate about Islam is dominated by about a dozen well-known clerics. They create trending topics through public arguments and controversies — Ahmet has accused fellow clerics of sacrilege and been called <a href="https://www.indyturk.com/node/258931/alparslan-kuytul-c%25252525C3%25252525BCbbeli%25252525E2%2525252580%2525252599nin-kitaplar%25252525C4%25252525B1n%25252525C4%25252525B1-basmak-satmak-ve-ilmi-ara%25252525C5%252525259Ft%25252525C4%25252525B1rma-maksad%25252525C4%25252525B1-d%25252525C4%25252525B1%25252525C5%252525259F%25252525C4%25252525B1nda">an informant for the Turkish government</a> — and play off each other’s successes and failures to win new followers. After spending decades traveling to remote Anatolian towns to deliver sohbets, Ahmet has seen social media prove an especially efficient way to grow his audience. The hours-long format of the traditional sohbet<em> </em>has given way to snippets that can go viral on Twitter or on Instagram, and like all savvy modern-day preachers, he tailors his speeches to better fit those platforms. Covid-19 also pushed him to scale up. His organization now releases between 20 and 25 new programs a week — up from three or four — and produces live sermons for broadcast. Ahmet and the community’s leaders have “a very direct relationship” with the IT department, observed <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/AytugHalil_Akar">Aytuğ Halil Akar</a>, a ’90s-era-coder-turned-pious-Muslim who oversees production.</p>



<p>The growing influence of these independent clerics has not gone unnoticed by the country’s leaders, who have a track record of censoring tech platforms for hosting content they disapprove of. Turkey banned YouTube in 2007 for a video that “insulted Turkishness,” again in 2014 for secretly taped recordings of government officials, in 2015 for videos depicting the assassination of a Turkish state prosecutor, and in 2016 for ISIS-produced execution videos of Turkish soldiers. In addition, authorities temporarily banned <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-12639279">Blogspot and Blogger and shut down</a> Twitter for two weeks, after the last refused to remove tweets alleging government corruption. According to Turkey’s Freedom of Expression Association, in 2019 alone, <a href="https://bianet.org/english/media/226856-report-turkey-banned-130-000-web-addresses-in-2019">the government banned 130,000 web addresses</a>, 7,000 Twitter accounts, 6,251 Facebook posts, and over 10,000 YouTube videos. A study published in 2020 found that Turkey ranks third on the list of countries with the most VPN users. Finally, just last winter, the government began enforcing legislation mandating that foreign social media platforms appoint representatives in Turkey to execute removal requests. If the companies failed to comply, they would be fined, and their bandwidth for Turkish traffic would be slowed by 90%. After being forced to pay about $5.4 million (40 million liras), YouTube gave in. On January 8, TikTok — where impersonations of Ahmet are a popular pastime — followed suit, as did Facebook shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital clerics are beginning to come under similar scrutiny — including Ahmet in Cassocks. Wary of his popularity, Erdoğan has made clear that he can pull the plug on the preacher any time he likes; while Ahmet, who openly supports Erdoğan, has boasted that his sohbet sessions 25 years ago may have helped raise the autocrat to power — and hinted that his new ones could do the opposite, if he so desired. Last year, in a show of force, Erdoğan <a href="https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/son-dakika-cubbeli-ahmet-ifadeye-cagrildi-selefi-dernekleri-silahlaniyor-iddiasi-41617783">ordered Ahmet to police headquarters for questioning</a>. Yet even in this climate, digital sohbets remain a popular way to speak out about sensitive issues. Since taking office in 2002, Turkey’s ruling AKP, the party of Erdoğan, has promised to create a “New Turkey” — a country in which religious freedom would be prioritized in the name of democracy. Internet clerics serve this Islam-friendly agenda, but they pose their own problems. Among the legions of YouTube sheikhs fawning over the government, there are also those subjecting it to thoughtful scrutiny on Twitter. And now, as more and more would-be clerics and followers have come of age in this new Turkey, they are joining a flourishing ecosystem that won’t easily be contained by authorities in Ankara.</p>

February 2, 2021 | https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-license-v2 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-license-v2">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><section><div><div><div><div><div><p>When we announced our license change for Elasticsearch and Kibana, moving the Apache 2.0-licensed source code to be dual licensed under both the Elastic License and SSPL, we also <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/license-change-clarification">mentioned</a> we would work closely with the community on a simplified and more permissive version of the Elastic License. I am happy to share the results with you.</p><p>The Elastic License is already widely used. More than 90% of our downloads are under the Elastic License, and those users enjoy the significant additional <a href="https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions">value provided</a> under the free and open Basic tier. Thanks to this value, the majority of our users and community are already using the software under the Elastic License, so they viewed our recent license change as a non-event. We are happy to see it, because our intent is to minimize any disruption to our community.</p><p>We took this opportunity to engage with our community and find ways to further simplify the Elastic License. After talking to users who reached out for clarification, we believe this new version will help to significantly address the majority of your&nbsp;concerns while protecting our products from <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">abuse, misinformation, and confusion</a>.
</p></div><h2>Elastic License v2
</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license">Elastic License v2 (ELv2)</a> is a very simple, non-copyleft license, allowing for the right to "use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software” and has only three high-level limitations. You cannot:
</p><ol><li>Provide the products to others as a managed service&nbsp;</li><li>Circumvent the license key functionality or remove/obscure features protected by license keys&nbsp;</li><li>Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices</li></ol><p>ELv2 applies to all of Elasticsearch and Kibana. It covers the distribution as well as the source code of all free and paid features.<br></p><p>We share our source code for both free and paid features in the spirit of openness. Unfortunately, our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/dear-search-guard-users-including-amazon-elasticsearch-service-open-distro-and-others">copyrights</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">trademarks</a> have been abused and misused. Our goal with this updated license is to be as permissive as possible while including a minimum set of protections. I hope these protections make sense. <a href="https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license/faq">See our FAQ</a> for more information about ELv2.
</p><div><p>We created ELv2 to hopefully allow others to adopt it. This is the license we wished was available in 2015 when we were a small company facing <a href="https://twitter.com/kimchy/status/1351534442993446917">misinformation</a>. It incorporates all of our learnings from our experience and others who have made similar changes (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-labs-modules-license-changes/">RedisLabs</a>, <a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/building-open-source-business-in-cloud-era-v2/">TimescaleDB</a>, <a href="https://www.graylog.org/post/graylog-v4-0-licensing-sspl">Graylog</a>, etc.). Hopefully we helped a little here. There are many companies out there facing a similar decision. I hope that over time, those of us with similar goals can coalesce around a smaller number of licenses and that ELv2 will be a catalyst for that.</p><p>In that spirit, we worked on ELv2 with <a href="https://heathermeeker.com/about-me/">Heather Meeker</a>, a lawyer who is well known for helping to draft many OSS licenses, including the Mozilla Public License 2.0, as well as helping a number of organizations build similar-in-spirit licenses like the <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/">Confluent Community License</a>, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">SSPL</a>, and others. We are also reaching out to initiatives like the <a href="https://polyformproject.org/">Polyform Project</a> and <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a> as additional efforts to raise awareness of this license and look for ways to promote its wider use.&nbsp;
</p></div><h2>SSPL remains an option for the source code
</h2><div><p>We added <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license">SSPL</a>, which is a copyleft license created by <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-now-released-under-the-server-side-public-license">MongoDB</a>, as an option to minimize the effect this license change would have on our users. MongoDB is one of the most popular projects out there, used by millions of developers who are happy with SSPL. </p><p>Since we made this announcement, we had many of our users reach out and say that they are thankful we provided this option. Their organizations are already using MongoDB, and this made our license change a non-event for them.</p><p>The SSPL is a licensing option for the source code, as shown below:
</p></div><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd65944c1b54a1e0b/6018987f29a02c49ba1f3e4a/chart-license-update-2021.jpg"></p><p>And to be clear, we are <a href="https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/20/Righteous-Expedient-Wrong.html">still</a> not claiming that either SSPL or the Elastic License are OSI-approved licenses.
</p><h2>Still no impact to our cloud and on-premises customers&nbsp;
</h2><p>It is important to repeat: there is no impact to any of our Elastic Cloud or self-managed customers. Our customers already use the default distribution under the Elastic License, and their use is governed by the terms of their subscription agreement, which continues to grant them access to additional features, access to support, and other Elastic commitments (for example, IP infringement indemnification) as before.
</p><h2>The path forward
</h2><p>These changes, including making the Elastic License more permissive, are intended to help us focus on building great products and investing in our community. This means building more great features, many of which we will provide for free and which will be developed in the open. But our commitment goes beyond the code. These license changes let us focus on what matters: helping you find success with our products.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>With the arrival of new, more contagious variants of COVID-19 in Canada, experts are recommending an upgrade in the quality—and quantity—of our face coverings</p><div>
																		<p><span>Look at photos of </span><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/double-mask-coronavirus_ca_60140605c5b653f644d2ed5b?ncid=tweetlnkcahpmg00000002"><span>President Joe Biden and you’ll notice he often wears two masks</span></a><span>: a light cloth or paper one over a heavy-duty N95 mask. “If you have a physical covering with one layer, you put another layer on,” </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/dr-fauci-double-mask-during-covid-makes-common-sense-more-effective.html"><span>said Dr. Anthony Fauci</span></a><span>, who has also frequently </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MayorBowser/status/1341835973722734592?s=20"><span>worn two masks</span></a><span>. “It just makes common sense that it likely would be more effective.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But there is also some urgency to this shift: With the arrival of new and more contagious variants to Canada, experts are asking everyone to think once again about the quality of our masks and how we use them. “We all need a bit of a reset regarding [COVID-19] precautions,” says Dr. Lynora Saxinger, </span><span>an infectious diseases physician in Edmonton. “We tend to cut corners and relax when something becomes commonplace.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For one thing, she says,</span><span> don’t shove a mask into your pocket after wearing it; if you’re asymptomatic, then the virus will be easily transferred from the mask to your hands. For another, don’t be complacent regarding the type and quality of your face coverings, such as masks that are comfortable to wear because they use porous materials, or </span><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html#a9"><span>neck gaiters, which can easily slip</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In fact, many of the masks we’re using aren’t as good as they should be. And, unlike last spring when the initial guidance around masks included recommending face coverings of tightly woven fabric, the risk perception has now changed. The new variants are so much more effective at infecting people that it’s time for a refresher course in face protection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html"><span>Health Canada’s guidelines</span></a><span> emphasize that masks need proper structure, material and fit to reduce the spread of infectious respiratory droplets. For example, Saxinger uses a couple of well-fitted multi-layer fabric masks, each with added filters of polypropylene material which she bought separately, in addition to cycling through lightly-worn medical masks, which she stores in separate envelopes for a few days before using them. And now, unlike in the spring, medical-quality disposable masks as well as more tightly fitted KN95 masks are available through retailers</span> <span>including </span><a href="https://www.costco.ca/kn95-disposable-5-layer-face-mask%2C-20-pack.product.100672009.html"><span>Costco</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.canadiansafetysupplies.com/Level-2-Hospital-Medical-3-Ply-Surgical-Masks-p/350117.htm?gclid=Cj0KCQiA6t6ABhDMARIsAONIYywfEhF1lBHDuf6XEc1nB9jQgZ_kni7_n69ikdQ7cCcEJJR2jNETNncaAti8EALw_wcB"><span>health care supply firms</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.wellwise.ca/en-ca/products/total-care-kn95-mask"><span>pharmacies</span></a><span> (supplies can fluctuate; also, many of the disposable masks and KN95s on the market are not medical grade).&nbsp;</span></p>

Each of their stories teaches us about life.</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span>While there is no official Canadian or U.S. guidance regarding double-masking or the need to upgrade to better quality masks, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/01/26/960893423/some-european-countries-move-to-require-medical-grade-masks-in-public"><span>Germany, Austria and France</span></a><span> recently told their residents to upgrade their face coverings from cloth versions to specific medical-grade ones, including KN95s, when they are in public spaces, including stores, or when near others for a prolonged period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The more layers the better, as long as they are breathable,” says Saxinger. Doubling up with whatever masks you have—whether two cloth ones, or a cloth and a disposable one—can offer more protection, as they can provide another layer of filtration and force a tighter fit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Indiana University, Fall 2020</p>

<p>High-level programming languages like Racket make it easier to program
relative to low-level languages such as x86 assembly code. But how do
high-level languages work? There’s a big gap between Racket and
machine instructions for modern computers. In this class you learn how
to translate Racket programs (a dialect of Scheme) all the way to x86
assembly language.</p>

<p>Traditionally, compiler courses teach one phase of the compiler at a
time, such as parsing, semantic analysis, and register allocation. The
problem with that approach is it is difficult to understand how the
whole compiler fits together and why each phase is designed the way it
is. Instead, each week we implement a successively larger subset of
the Racket language. The very first subset is a tiny language of
integer arithmetic, and by the time we are done the language includes
first-class functions.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> B521 or C311. Fluency in Racket is highly recommended
as students will do a lot of programming in Racket. Prior knowledge of
an assembly language helps, but is not required.</p>

<p><strong>Textbook:</strong> The notes for the course are available
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktdw8j0adcc44r0/book.pdf?dl=1">here</a>. If
you have suggestions for improvement, please either send an email to
Jeremy or, even better, make edits to a branch of the book and perform
a pull request. The book is at the following location on github:</p>

<p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>

<p>Course grades are based on the following items. For the weighting, see
the Canvas panel on the right-hand side of this web page.  Grading
will take into account any technology problems that arrise, i.e., you
won’t fail the class because your internet went out.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assignments</li>
  <li>Quizzes</li>
  <li>Midterm Exam (October 23, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
  <li>Final Exam (December 15, Online as a Canvas Quiz)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>

<p>Organize into teams of 2-4 students. Assignments will be due bi-weekly
on Mondays at 11:59pm. Teams that include one or more graduate
students are required to complete the challenge exercises.</p>

<p>Assignment descriptions are posted on Canvas.
Turn in your assignments by creating a github repository and giving
access to Jeremy (jsiek) and Caner (cderici).</p>

<p>Assignments will be graded based on how many test cases they succeed on.
Partial credit will be given for each “pass” of the compiler.
Some of the tests are in the public support code (see Resources below)
and the rest of the tests will be made available on Sunday night, one
day prior to the due date. The testing will be done on the linux
machine kj.luddy.indiana.edu named
after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Johnson">Katherine
Johnson</a> of NASA
fame. The testing will include both new tests and all of the tests
from prior assignments.</p>

<p>You may request feedback on your assignments prior to the due date.
Just commit your work to github and send us email.</p>

<p>Students are responsible for understanding the entire assignment and
all of the code that their team produces. The midterm and final exam
are designed to test a student’s understanding of the assignments.</p>

<p>Students are free to discuss and get help on the assignments from
anyone or anywhere. When posting questions on Piazza, it is OK to post
your code.</p>

<p>In contrast, for quizzes and exams, students are asked to work
alone. The quizzes and exams are closed book.  We will be using
Respondus Monitor for online proctoring.</p>

<p>The Final Project is due Dec. 4 and may be turned in late up to
Dec. 11.</p>

<p><strong>Late assignment policy:</strong> Assignments may be turned in up to one
week late with a penalty of 10%.</p>

<p><strong>Bias-Based Incident Reporting.</strong></p>

<p>Bias-based incident reports can be made by students, faculty and
staff. Any act of discrimination or harassment based on race,
ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender, gender identity, sexual
orientation or disability can be reported through any of the options:</p>

<p>1) email biasincident@indiana.edu or incident@indiana.edu;</p>

<p>2) call the Dean of Students Office at (812) 855-8188 or</p>

<p>3) use the IU mobile App (m.iu.edu). Reports can be made anonymously.</p>

<p><strong>Dean on Call.</strong></p>

<p>The Dean of Students office provides support for students dealing with
serious or emergency situations after 5 p.m. in which an immediate
response is needed and which cannot wait until the next business
day. Faculty or staff who are concerned about a student’s welfare
should feel free to call the Dean on Call at (812) 856-7774. This
number is not to be given to students or families but is for internal
campus use only. If someone is in immediate danger or experiencing an
emergency, call 911.</p>

<p><strong>Boost.</strong></p>

<p>Indiana University has developed an award-winning smartphone app to
help students stay on top of their schoolwork in Canvas. The app is
called “Boost,” it is available for free to all IU students, and it
integrates with Canvas to provide reminders about deadlines and other
helpful notifications. For more information, see
https://kb.iu.edu/d/atud.</p>

					<p>
						Let's start with the good stuff: when we're talking about Bézier curves, we're talking about the things that you can see in the following
						graphics. They run from some start point to some end point, with their curvature influenced by one or more "intermediate" control points.
						Now, because all the graphics on this page are interactive, go manipulate those curves a bit: click-drag the points, and see how their
						shape changes based on what you do.
					</p>
					

					<p>
						These curves are used a lot in computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) applications, as well as in graphic design
						programs like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Inkscape, GIMP, etc. and in graphic technologies like scalable vector graphics (SVG) and
						OpenType fonts (TTF/OTF). A lot of things use Bézier curves, so if you want to learn more about them... prepare to get your learn on!

					<p>
						Playing with the points for curves may have given you a feel for how Bézier curves behave, but what <em>are</em> Bézier curves, really?
						There are two ways to explain what a Bézier curve is, and they turn out to be the entirely equivalent, but one of them uses complicated
						maths, and the other uses really simple maths. So... let's start with the simple explanation:
					</p>
					<p>
						Bézier curves are the result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation">linear interpolations</a>. That sounds
						complicated but you've been doing linear interpolation since you were very young: any time you had to point at something between two other
						things, you've been applying linear interpolation. It's simply "picking a point between two points".
					</p>
					<p>
						If we know the distance between those two points, and we want a new point that is, say, 20% the distance away from the first point (and
						thus 80% the distance away from the second point) then we can compute that really easily:

					<p>
						So let's look at that in action: the following graphic is interactive in that you can use your up and down arrow keys to increase or
						decrease the interpolation ratio, to see what happens. We start with three points, which gives us two lines. Linear interpolation over
						those lines gives us two points, between which we can again perform linear interpolation, yielding a single point. And that point —and all
						points we can form in this way for all ratios taken together— form our Bézier curve:

					<p>And that brings us to the complicated maths: calculus.</p>
					<p>
						While it doesn't look like that's what we've just done, we actually just drew a quadratic curve, in steps, rather than in a single go. One
						of the fascinating parts about Bézier curves is that they can both be described in terms of polynomial functions, as well as in terms of
						very simple interpolations of interpolations of [...]. That, in turn, means we can look at what these curves can do based on both "real
						maths" (by examining the functions, their derivatives, and all that stuff), as well as by looking at the "mechanical" composition (which
						tells us, for instance, that a curve will never extend beyond the points we used to construct it).
					</p>
					<p>
						So let's start looking at Bézier curves a bit more in depth: their mathematical expressions, the properties we can derive from them, and
						the various things we can do to, and with, Bézier curves.
					</p>

					<p>
						Bézier curves are a form of "parametric" function. Mathematically speaking, parametric functions are cheats: a "function" is actually a
						well defined term representing a mapping from any number of inputs to a <strong>single</strong> output. Numbers go in, a single number
						comes out. Change the numbers that go in, and the number that comes out is still a single number.
					</p>
					<p>
						Parametric functions cheat. They basically say "alright, well, we want multiple values coming out, so we'll just use more than one
						function". An illustration: Let's say we have a function that maps some value, let's call it <i>x</i>, to some other value, using some
						kind of number manipulation:
					</p>
					<!--
\setmainfont[Ligatures=TeX]TeX Gyre Pagella \setmathfontTeX Gyre Pagella Math
 
                                                               f(x) = cos (x)
-->
					<img src="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/images/chapters/explanation/0cc876c56200446c60114c1b0eeeb2cc.svg" width="96px" height="17px" loading="lazy">
					<p>
						The notation <i>f(x)</i> is the standard way to show that it's a function (by convention called <i>f</i> if we're only listing one) and
						its output changes based on one variable (in this case, <i>x</i>). Change <i>x</i>, and the output for <i>f(x)</i> changes.
					</p>
					<p>So far, so good. Now, let's look at parametric functions, and how they cheat. Let's take the following two functions:</p>
					<!--
\setmainfont[Ligatures=TeX]TeX Gyre Pagella \setmathfontTeX Gyre Pagella Math
 
                                                               f(a) = cos (a)
                                                               f(b) = sin (b)

					<p>
						There's nothing really remarkable about them, they're just a sine and cosine function, but you'll notice the inputs have different names.
						If we change the value for <i>a</i>, we're not going to change the output value for <i>f(b)</i>, since <i>a</i> isn't used in that
						function. Parametric functions cheat by changing that. In a parametric function all the different functions share a variable, like this:

						Multiple functions, but only one variable. If we change the value for <i>t</i>, we change the outcome of both <i>f<sub>a</sub>(t)</i> and
						<i>f<sub>b</sub>(t)</i>. You might wonder how that's useful, and the answer is actually pretty simple: if we change the labels
						<i>f<sub>a</sub>(t)</i> and <i>f<sub>b</sub>(t)</i> with what we usually mean with them for parametric curves, things might be a lot more
						obvious:

					<p>There we go. <i>x</i>/<i>y</i> coordinates, linked through some mystery value <i>t</i>.</p>
					<p>
						So, parametric curves don't define a <i>y</i> coordinate in terms of an <i>x</i> coordinate, like normal functions do, but they instead
						link the values to a "control" variable. If we vary the value of <i>t</i>, then with every change we get <strong>two</strong> values,
						which we can use as (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) coordinates in a graph. The above set of functions, for instance, generates points on a circle: We
						can range <i>t</i> from negative to positive infinity, and the resulting (<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>) coordinates will always lie on a circle with
						radius 1 around the origin (0,0). If we plot it for <i>t</i> from 0 to 5, we get this:

					<p>
						Bézier curves are just one out of the many classes of parametric functions, and are characterised by using the same base function for all
						of the output values. In the example we saw above, the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values were generated by different functions (one uses a
						sine, the other a cosine); but Bézier curves use the "binomial polynomial" for both the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> outputs. So what are
						binomial polynomials?
					</p>
					<p>You may remember polynomials from high school. They're those sums that look like this:</p>

                                                   f(x) = a  · x  + b  · x  + c  · x + d

					<p>
						If the highest order term they have is <i>x³</i>, they're called "cubic" polynomials; if it's <i>x²</i>, it's a "square" polynomial; if
						it's just <i>x</i>, it's a line (and if there aren't even any terms with <i>x</i> it's not a polynomial!)
					</p>
					<p>
						Bézier curves are polynomials of <i>t</i>, rather than <i>x</i>, with the value for <i>t</i> being fixed between 0 and 1, with
						coefficients <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> etc. taking the "binomial" form, which sounds fancy but is actually a pretty simple description for mixing
						values:

						Notice that 2 is the same as 1+1, and 3 is 2+1 and 1+2, and 6 is 3+3... As you can see, each time we go up a dimension, we simply start
						and end with 1, and everything in between is just "the two numbers above it, added together", giving us a simple number sequence known as

						And that's the full description for Bézier curves. Σ in this function indicates that this is a series of additions (using the variable

					</p>
					<div>
						<h3>How to implement the basis function</h3>
						<p>We could naively implement the basis function as a mathematical construct, using the function as our guide, like this:</p>

						

						<p>
							I say we could, because we're not going to: the factorial function is <em>incredibly</em> expensive. And, as we can see from the above
							explanation, we can actually create Pascal's triangle quite easily without it: just start at [1], then [1,1], then [1,2,1], then
							[1,3,3,1], and so on, with each next row fitting 1 more number than the previous row, starting and ending with "1", with all the numbers
							in between being the sum of the previous row's elements on either side "above" the one we're computing.
						</p>
						<p>
							We can generate this as a list of lists lightning fast, and then never have to compute the binomial terms because we have a lookup
							table:
						</p>

						<table>
							<tbody><tr>
								<td>1</td>
								<td rowspan="18">
									
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>2</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>3</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>4</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>5</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>6</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>7</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>8</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>9</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>10</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>11</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>12</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>13</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>14</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>15</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>16</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>17</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>18</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody></table>

						<p>
							So what's going on here? First, we declare a lookup table with a size that's reasonably large enough to accommodate most lookups. Then,
							we declare a function to get us the values we need, and we make sure that if an <i>n/k</i> pair is requested that isn't in the LUT yet,
							we expand it first. Our basis function now looks like this:
						</p>

<p>Many people, even among security experts and privacy advocates, hold the firm
belief that WhatsApp is more <em>secure</em> and privacy-wise better than Telegram.
After having thoroughly studied the issue, I do not believe this to be true.
In this article I will try to highlight the necessary facts to enable the
reader to form a more informed opinion on the matter.</p>

<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>Most sources which praise WhatsApp and criticize Telegram make bold claims,
presenting them as objective truth, without
sufficiently motivating them or backing them up with facts. In many cases they
rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">arguments from authority</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Telegram] By default, it is less safe than @WhatsApp, which makes [it] dangerous
for non-experts. — <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/778597417797226496" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ed. Snowden (Sep, 2016)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realize that many of you will be sceptical now. After all, if Edward Snowden
said so, it <em>must</em> be true. Why would you question it? And why, above all, should we <em>believe</em> you instead?</p>
<p>Well, the point is exactly this. I am not asking you to believe <em>me</em>, but to
evaluate the facts, with an open mind, before forming an opinion.
Moreover, even if it might be hard to accept, even heroes and geniuses like Edward
Snowden can be wrong from time to time!</p>
<p>I made a good faith attempt to research all the facts and present them as
objectively as possible, without including personal biases. However, please
keep in mind that I do not consider myself infallible, and thus there might be
some mistakes. Feel free to let me know what you think.</p>




<h2 id="fallacies">The fallacies</h2>
<p>The vast majority of things I read on this topic can be reduced to a combination
of the following factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not considering a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">threat model</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_premise" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">false premise</a> that end-to-end encryption alone is a necessary and
sufficient condition for good security and privacy.</li>
<li>The erroneous conclusion that everything that is not end-to-end encrypted is
inherently less secure and must be avoided at all cost.</li>
<li>The huge respect for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moxie_Marlinspike" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Moxie Marlinspike</a>, one of the authors of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">end-to-end encryption protocol</a> used by WhatsApp and
Signal, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">arguments from authority</a>.</li>
<li>Outright lies about the insecurity of the cryptographic protocol used by
Telegram.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of the article is dedicated to amply clarify each of the points
above. In <a href="#threat-models">section 3</a> I will articulate the importance of considering threat
models when trying to determine if a system is <em>secure</em>. In <a href="">section 4</a>
I will discuss end-to-end encryption, the challenges that it entails and how it
is implemented in WhatsApp and Telegram. In <a href="#telegram">section 5</a> I will address the most
common criticisms of Telegram, and finally, in <a href="#conclusion">section 6</a>, I will draw some conclusions.</p>


<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Threat modeling answers questions like “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?”, “What are the most relevant threats?”, and “What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?”. — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Searching on Hacker News for <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=%22whatsapp%20is%20more%20secure%22&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=all" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“WhatsApp is more secure”</a>
yields some typical comments from people arguing that WhatsApp is more secure
than Telegram</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Telegram is more fun (bots and stickers), but <strong>WhatsApp is more secure</strong>
(no messages on server, no rolled-your-own-crypto). — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14374644" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or even that Telegram is the least secure</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can anyone call “Telegram” secure? Those days are over. It’s the least
secure messaging app of them all now. <strong>Even WhatsApp is more secure than
Telegram</strong> (let alone Threema). — <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13032192" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">hn</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, what does it really mean that WhatsApp is <em>more secure</em>? Secure against the
government? Secure against your friendly neighbourhood hacker snooping on
the Wi-Fi at Starbucks?
Secure against throwing rocks at your phone? Secure against your mom trying to
read your messages?</p>
<p>Defending from an adversary with practically unlimited budget and computational
resources, such as a powerful government, is going to be much harder than
defending against a curious neighbour sniffing on your Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>Saying that WhatsApp is more secure than Telegram,
without specifying against what kind of adversary or against what kind of threat,
does not mean much.</strong></p>

<p>Without considering these questions and only craving for <em>“more security”</em>, <strong>is
not necessarily a smart thing</strong> either.
In the same way that putting your possessions in a nuclear bunker
might be more secure, in
case of a nuclear war, than locking them in a small safe in your room, but could
not be the best choice if all you are trying to do is protect your Blu-ray
collection from your flatmate!
Moreover, <strong>increasing security is often not free</strong>, because
it increases complexity, thus development cost, and can decrease usability. Exactly like a nuclear bunker
is going to be much more expensive than a small safe and is also not going to be
as easy to use.
Lastly, it is important to note that <strong>you are as secure as the weakest link in your system</strong>.
Therefore, if you want a nuclear bunker, with all the challenges and costs that
it entails, but then forget to put a lock on its door, it might not protect you that
much after all.</p>


<p>Consequently, let us now try to examine which of the <em>components</em> involved in
using a messaging app can be potentially attacked by a malicious agent,
compromising our security.
For each of these, <em>you</em> need to establish if you blindly trust it to function
correctly, or if you believe it could be compromised and thus need to find a way
to defend it from the potential threat.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The companies running the servers needed by the app to work</strong>. That is,
Facebook, Telegram and whatever other third party services they decide to
use or share your data with.<ol>
<li>Are you OK with them being able to read your messages?</li>
<li>Do you trust them on keeping your data safe? So that it does not get
stolen, for example.</li>
<li>Are you OK with them selling your data or meta-data to advertisers?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The app itself</strong>. That is, the WhatsApp or Telegram apps on your
phone.<ol>
<li>Do you trust that it does exactly what it says and is not malicious? For
example that it is always encrypting your messages.</li>
<li>Do you trust its developers to be good citizens and not insert backdoors?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The communication medium</strong>. That is, the Internet.<ol>
<li>Do you trust the connection between you and the app’s servers to be
secure?</li>
<li>Do you trust your ISP?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>The distribution and update process</strong>. For example, the Play Store, App
Store or F-Droid. Do you trust Google and Apple to give you the real app,
and not a specially crafted one to spy on you?</li>
<li><strong>The other apps on your phone</strong>. Do you trust all the other apps on your
phone, or do you think some of them might be malware?</li>
<li><strong>The OS</strong>. That is, Android or iOS. Do you trust your
operative system and its developers (e.g. Google, Samsung, Apple)? For example,
do you trust that no malicious actor can remotely <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/latest-security-news/gaps-in-google-play-store-xfo-allow-attackers-to-remotely-install-malware-on-android-devices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">install</a>
or <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2010/06/exercising-our-remote-application.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">uninstall</a> software on your device?</li>
<li><strong>The firmware and the hardware</strong>. Do you trust your phone is not running
malware at the firmware or hardware level,
<a href="https://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/SamsungGalaxyBackdoor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">like it was discovered on Samsung phones in 2014</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whew, that was quite a list!</p>
<p>But, <strong>do we really need to care about all of this stuff?</strong> Well, not many
people do.
However, if you want to evaluate which messaging app best suits your needs and
you care a bit about security and privacy, then it is essential.
This process will enable you to decide for yourself, without basing your decision
on some tweet saying that one app is <em>more secure</em> than the other.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is important to reiterate that if you are worried that a powerful
adversary, like a government, might want to directly target you (as opposed to
compromise you as part of a mass surveillance program), you cannot defend only
against one attack vector and ignore the others.
You can have the most secure messaging app in the world, but if your phone can be hacked
with an SMS, there is not much of a difference.</p>


<p>You might wonder why couldn’t we just try to defend ourselves against all possible
threats and attacks. It is because, as we said before and as we will show in more
detail in the next section, increasing security is not free but comes
with the cost of increased complexity and very often decreased usability.</p>

<h2 id="e2ee">End-to-end encryption</h2>
<p>Let us now address the most common reason that induces people to believe that
WhatsApp is a better choice: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">end-to-end encryption</a>.</p>

<p>WhatsApp describes end-to-end encryption (or E2EE for short) in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End-to-end encryption ensures only you and the person you’re communicating
with can read or listen to what is sent, and nobody in between, not even
WhatsApp. This is because with end-to-end encryption, your messages are
secured with a lock, and only the recipient and you have the special key
needed to unlock and read them. All of this happens automatically: no need to
turn on any special settings to secure your messages. — <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/end-to-end-encryption/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp FAQ</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>WhatsApp nowadays has end-to-end encryption enabled by default for all chats,
while Telegram has not enabled it by default and does not support it on group
chats.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a very nice property to have. If implemented correctly it
allows us to communicate securely, even in the case in which the server (i.e.
WhatsApp or Telegram) cannot be trusted and is considered malicious.
However, if we decide to go down this road and not trust any more the companies
running our app, we introduce a series of new complications.</p>
<p>However, one could argue that even in the case in which we decide to trust the
Service, it is beneficial to have end-to-end encryption. This is a valid point because, while
we might trust the Service, for sure we do not trust some potential malicious
actors compromising the Service’s infrastructure and getting access to our data. In
this scenario our data should still be safe because not even the Service has
access to it, and therefore an attacker cannot steal the decryption key nor
coerce the Service to disclose it. This is the major strength of
E2EE.
Nonetheless, it is worth to stress that in this scenario we assumed to trust
the …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Welcome to the forty-fifth issue of Racket News.</p>

<div><p><img src="https://racket-news.com/img/issue45/happybday-2021.jpg" alt=""></p></div>

<p>Today the is second birthday of Racket News. The first issue was released exactly 2 years ago on Feb 1st, 2019. A lot has happened in Racket in the last few years and it’s going stronger than ever : as a language, implementation, and community. Many thanks to all of you who have been following Racket News, sending suggestions for improvements and contributions to the issues. Cheers to a new year!</p>

<p>With the good news out of the way, my apologies for the delayed issue. We missed the mid-month issue in January as I had a rough start of the year but I am now on the right track and things should proceed as normal. The next issue should be here on February 15th, and the following one on March 1st.</p>

<p>Grab a coffee and lets dive in!</p>

<p>This week’s project in the spotlight is <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/resyntax/index.html"><code>resyntax</code></a> by Jack Firth.</p>

<p>From the website:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Resyntax is a refactoring tool for Racket. The tool can be guided by refactoring rules, which are macro-like functions defined in terms of syntax-parse that specify how to search for and refactor different coding patterns.</p>
 <p>This tool is extremely experimental. Do not attempt to incorporate it into your projects yet. For now, the refactoring suggestions produced by resyntax are best viewed as glimpses into one possible distant future of static analysis for Racket. Feedback, questions, and ideas are all greatly appreciated and are best directed at the GitHub repository.</p>
 <p>Resyntax does not have anything approaching a public API yet. If you want to actually try using it, open the source code of the resyntax module using DrRacket’s “Open Require Path” menu option, change the file path given to the refactor-file! function in the main submodule, then run it. Choosing a file checked into Git (or another version control system) is highly recommended in order to make it easier to view the diff and easier to undo the changes.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s unusual for me to spotlight a recently released project but I find that one of the things that are really needed in the Racket ecosystem are devtools like these, therefore this is a spotlight for the experimental version. I hope it excites you as much as it does me.</p>





<p>This issue’s featured paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wtaSi4HUG8S2P6gyLks1DTkr04hIbWYf/view?usp=sharing">Programming Languages as Operating Systems (or Revenge of the Son of the Lisp Machine)</a> by Matthew Flatt, Robert Findler, Shriram Krishnamurti, and Matthias Felleisen.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>The MrEd virtual machine serves both as the implementation platform for the DrScheme programming environment, and as the underlying Scheme engine for executing expressions and programs entered into DrScheme’s read-eval-print loop. We describe the key elements of the MrEd virtual machine for building a programming environment, and we step through the implementation of a miniature version of DrScheme in MrEd. More generally, we show how MrEd defines a high-level operating system for graphical programs.</p></blockquote>

It uses <a href="https://sequelize.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sequelize</a> to handle the connection</p>
<p>It's free to use and doesn't require an API key or authentication. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/Cosbgn/zero-labs/blob/master/api/http2sql.js" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
<p>With Zero you can build great interactive dashboards pulling data directly from your SQL database! It's free!
Give it a try at <a href="https://zero.sh/play" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://zero.sh/play</a></p>
<h2 id="1-make-sure-that-your-request-is-private-and-from-a-secure-connection">1. Make sure that your request is private and from a secure connection</h2>
<p>This API requires that you pass the entire database connection URI. This contains your username and password so never use this API directly from your frontend or from somewhere where users can access it.</p>
<p>If you use it on Zero.sh save your connection string on a <code>secret</code> and use that.</p>
<h2 id="2-format-your-request">2. Format your request</h2>
<p>This API accepts only <strong>POST</strong> requests to this endpoint: <code>https://labs.zero.sh/api/http2sql</code></p>
<p>The following data is allowed:</p>

<li><strong>uri</strong>:
You database connection uri, e.g. <code>postgres:// ...</code>.</li>
<li><strong>query</strong>:
Your SQL query, e.g. <code>Select * from "Users"</code></li>
<li><strong>config_object</strong>:
If you don't want to pass the URI you can alternatively pass a <a href="https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sequelize connection object</a> - e.g. <code>{dialect: 'mysql', etc}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You always need to pass a <code>query</code> and either the <code>uri</code> or the <code>config_object</code></p>

<p>If you couldn’t tell by the title, this is a response to
<a href="https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277">this gist</a>, stating
that we should boycott Wayland because something something Red Hat evil and breakage
and…​global menus? Well, there were quite a few exaggerations and misrepresentations in
the gist, which will be shown and explained here.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>I’ll start off with this: many of the links are misquoted, some don’t even support the
points made with them, and some are highlighted supposed "broken" functionality with
either wrong dates or bugs that <em>have already been fixed</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, Wayland is different than Xorg. It was a complete re-imagining of how a modern and
less monolithic display protocol should look. Of course, breakage isn’t necessarily a
<em>good</em> thing…​but at the same time, some form of breakage is going to be inevitable. As
we’ll see soon, the breakage has mostly been confined to a few specific places (screen
capture most notably), where the current X way simply would not work with a more
secure protocol.</p>
<p>Now, I would be lying if I said this hasn’t taken a long time to develop, or that I
haven’t missed some of these features, but Linux apps and development are done by many
individual developers, whether volunteers or paid. As a result, a lot of work <em>does</em> take
a long time to complete. That being said, X’s current policy towards things like screen
capture and key binding is simply insecure, and it is inevitable that we will have to move
away from it eventually.</p>
<p>Furthermore, is it really worth throwing the entire protocol away for screen casting
(which works but needs more adoption) and…​global menus? I’ve been using Wayland on my
primary system for ages, and the flag workarounds for screen capture in Chromium (as
mentioned below) have been working fine for me. It’s not a perfect solution, but the
benefits Wayland provides have far exceeded the amount of time I’ve had to spend tweaking
the few things that weren’t working out of the box.</p>
<p>Some of Xorg’s core issues that required breakage to be solved in Wayland, such as it being
trivially easy to create keyloggers or view <em>any window without permissions</em> really are
things that you’d expect to see /r/linuxmasterrace mocking Windows over, not problems that
we should ignore on a supposedly secure system.</p>
<p>One more thing I’d like to add: <em>many of these links honestly make no sense as sources</em> or
were talking about entirely different things, with some discussion cherry-picked without
context. Without further ado…​</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>Screen recording has been available in Wayland for quite some time now, via
{link-pipewire} and {link-xdg-desktop-portal}. Now, the gist <em>does</em> make allusions to this:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Or force more Red Hat/Gnome components (glib, Portals, Pipewire) on everyone! [...]
There is a workaround for OBS Studio that requires a obs-xdg-portal plugin (which is known
to be Red Hat/Flatpak-centric, GNOME-centric, "perhaps" works with other desktops)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This is…​really, just completely wrong.</p>
<p>I have no idea why anything here would require clients to use GLib. All of the portal
APIs work over D-Bus, and Pipewire doesn’t even require GLib.</p>

<p>Even just looking at the
<a href="https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/graphs/contributors">top contributors</a>,
we see contributions from employees of Collabora, Igalia, and Mozilla, not just Red Hat.</p>
<p>Pipewire also is not really a project that’s particularly tied to Red Hat; yes, the main
developer is from Red Hat, but he’s also a multimedia expert and one of the two creators
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer#Early_days">GStreamer</a> (a project founded while
the developer was still at Collabora). As of right now, Collabora is
<a href="https://www.collabora.com/about-us/open-source/open-source-projects/pipewire.html">a leading contributor to Pipewire as well</a>.
Even <a href="http://libregraphicsworld.org/blog/entry/podcast-ep-003-paul-davis-on-fixing-big-linux-audio-issues#main:~:text=PipeWire%20is%20an%20interesting%20project">
the creator of JACK is interested in Pipewire</a>, despite initially being skeptical.</p>
<p>A lot of the particular linked examples are just bizarre extrapolations:</p>

<p>This was targeting Linux screencasting <em>in general</em> as highlighted by the ffmpeg reference.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vkohaupt/vokoscreenNG/issues/51">https://github.com/vkohaupt/vokoscreenNG/issues/51</a> broken since at least 7 Mar 2020.
("I have now decided that there will be no Wayland support for the time being. Reason,
there is no budget for it. Let’s see how it looks in a year or two.") - This is the key
problem. Wayland breaks everything and then expects others to fix the wreckage it caused
on their own expense.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Looks like I missed the part where the Wayland developers had the ability to update every
single project in existence and add full Wayland support. Better yet, the issue would
indicate more lack of time by the developer to be able to push updates, not that Wayland
"breaks everything".</p>

<p>Okay, this one is just laughable. An OBS developer also stated in the same thread:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>For reference X11 solutions are very close to the worst possible interface one could design.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>which would imply that we can’t really stay with X screencasting either, thus ruining the
entire "just stick with X argument".</p>
<p>Better yet, <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/14">there’s already an RFC open for
Wayland support</a>. All the portals they mentioned as "incomplete" do already support the
screencast APIs anyway, so their knowledge at the time about it was likely already
outdated.</p>
<p>Now onto "screen sharing", which is the same API problem as "screen casting", but let’s
entertain the idea that it’s actually two separate points:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6389">https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/issues/6389</a> broken since 24 Jan 2016 ("Closing since
there is nothing we can do from the Jitsi Meet side.") See? Wayland breaks stuff and
leaves application developers helpless and unable to fix the breakage, even if they wanted.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>First off…​this is two issues from the same repo. How does this count as two separate
breakages? I don’t even know where "2016" comes from, because the second issue was created
this year.</p>
<p>The quoted text was not in response to Wayland missing functionality; Pipewire already
existed at this point. Rather it was related to browsers implementing the screencast API.
This has been implemented in Chromium behind a flag for years at least, and it was only
behind a flag because parts of Chromium’s UI flow assumed there was no permissions model,
so it would ask the user to select a window to share after they already selected it in the
Wayland compositor. This is actively being worked on in both
<a href="https://webrtc-review.googlesource.com/c/src//189544[WebRTC]%20andhttps://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src//1942327">Chromium itself</a>.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/22">https://github.com/flathub/us.zoom.Zoom/issues/22</a> Zoom broken since at least 4 Jan 2019.
("Can not start share, we only support wayland on GNOME with Ubuntu (17, 18), Fedora (25
to 29), Debian 9, openSUSE Leap 15, Arch Linux"). No word about non-GNOME!</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>"Yes, let’s highlight a Linux client that is notoriously buggy and generally terrible."</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>Again, I don’t know why this is split into three sections. But first off:</p>

<p><strong>The issue had nothing to do with this, and this is a gross misquoting.</strong> The issue reads:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>This Gtk+4 fact, will be sad and will make Gtk+ unusable to the Gnome Global Menu
extension, as it’s implemented now. That’s why the Gnome Global Menu extension will be
discontinued again. The first reason was because the lack of the Gtk+ Wayland support for
the Global Menu, that was resolved here and now will be because Gtk+ will no longer
supports generic loadable modules.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In other words, this issue was showing something unrelated, and at the time, Wayland
support was already working. The date used in the gist ("broken since 24 Aug 2018") is
also incorrect, since it’s pointing to the date the linked issue was filed, at which point
Wayland support was again working.</p>
<p>GTK’s own lack of support for global menus over Wayland itself had little to do with
Wayland and more to do with GTK itself not wanting to support global menus, as the current
global menu implementation was very closely targeting Xorg.</p>
<p>Next up:</p>

<p>In other words…​if you actually read the article, they were able to make it work on
Wayland <strong>without</strong> the re-engineering. In fact, the whole point of the article was to
highlight that they were able to get it to work.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>KDE had to do additional work to work around it. And it still did not work:</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The linked bug literally says this was fixed in 5.20.</p>

<p><strong>This is literally the same link as above</strong>. Why is this a separate point?</p>

<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->



<p><strong>Once again, this has been fixed:</strong></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The best solution is for Qt including the QPA platform plugin and having a proper
auto-detection based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE. The situation will improve with Qt 5.11, but it
doesn’t really help as the Qt LTS versions will continue to face the problem.</p>
<p>For now we implemented a change in Plasma 5.13 so that we don’t need to set the env variable
any more. Plasma is able to select the appropriate platform plugin based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE
environment variable. Non-Plasma processes will use the default platform plugin. With Qt
&lt; 5.11 this is xcb, with Qt 5.11 this will most likely change to wayland. KDE’s flatpak
applications pick Wayland by default in a Wayland session and are unaffected by the change.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Really, I’d argue the actual problem is trying to bundle every individual dependency into
a single file and expecting the users to never have to add anything else? This is pretty
bizarre especially because it’s no different than having to include the global menu
platform plugin to make global menus work, which AppImages already need! In other words,
this is just an AppImage problem and its style clashing with the Qt reliance on various
forms of dynamically-loaded plugins.</p>
<!-- Make all the headers smaller -->


<p>The opening to the article says:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Wayland solves no issues I have</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>I’d like to make a quick jab at this statement: just because you don’t have issues doesn’t
imply that aren’t issues that others are stuck dealing with or fixing. Xorg’s APIs are
quite nasty, and developers have to deal with them. There are things that Wayland can
support easily but X cannot, and there are people who have to deal with those.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Is-Wayland-the-New-X">This article</a> covers
a few of the reasons X is a mess:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Stone traces the earliest origins of Wayland to a page on the X.Org wiki started by Adam Jackson called X12. “It wasn’t a serious attempt at a design,” Stone stresses, “but a list of things we would do differently if we had a chance to rework the core protocol.”</p>
<p>For many developers, this list helped codify the problems …</p></blockquote></div></div></div>

		 <h4>Surprising sound let down by serious comfort problems</h4>

		 
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-1.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=6b8a0daf46384709fee2520ad544cdff"></p>
<p>I’m conflicted about Apple’s latest foray into audio products, the AirPods Max over-ear headphones.</p>
<p>In striking opposition to every other review I’ve seen so far, I get to begin mine by stating that I <em>am</em> an audiophile. A friendly, reasonable one, but still—<a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/plague-inc-the-cure">audio is my jam</a>. I’ve been writing music for games and film for over 10 years, so one would hope that I’ve learned a thing or two about audio production in that time. It is, therefore, my sworn duty to be skeptical of consumer technology companies encroaching on the territory of high-end audio equipment built by companies with decades of experience.</p>

<p>Apple has had a long and fruitful relationship with music, but their track record with audio hardware is inconsistent. Somehow, the company that makes the HomePod—a marvel of mono speaker engineering—is also the company that continues to make and sell Beats products. Beats are a common entry point into the world of audio, but they’re priced the way they are because of their brand power, not because their quality justifies it. You can get much better sound, comfort, features, and build for less money.</p>
<p>Today, I find myself wondering to what extent that is also true for the AirPods Max.</p>
<p>Having forked over just under $900 <span>CAD</span> for the privilege of owning a pair, I wanted to see whether Apple is aiming to establish itself as a purveyor of quality audio gear—deserving of a high price tag—or whether we’ll once again be paying for style over substance.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-5.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=3b6c49e79651f9f936486a7886ff54db"></p>

<p>I laughed when I pulled the AirPods Max out of their box. I knew they would be heavy, but the experience of that weight is really something else.</p>
<p>For context, the Sennheiser <span>PXC</span> 550—my current headphone choice for travel—weigh 227g. The famously comfortable Bose 700 weigh 254g, a weight that’s matched by the popular Sony WH-1000XM4. Premium pairs like the Bang &amp; Olufsen <span>H9</span> (third generation) weigh 295g, and the Bowers &amp; Wilkins <span>PX7</span> just barely crest the 300g mark.</p>
<p>The AirPods Max weigh <em>385g</em>.</p>
<p>In the same way that the iPhone 12’s aluminum build <em>looks</em> less fancy but <em>feels</em> nicer in use than its Pro counterparts and their stainless steel, the mostly-metal build of the AirPods Max is a choice that favours fashion over comfort.</p>
<p>The reason that other high-end headphone manufacturers lean heavily on plastic and even wood in their builds isn’t that they can’t afford metal. It’s because they’re interested in having human beings wear these products on their heads for hours at a time.</p>
<p>As one such human being with a head, I wish Apple had taken some cues from the competition on this front. Even after adjusting the way I wear them, I can’t escape the fact that these are just plain <em>uncomfortable</em> for long listening sessions. The mesh headband and foam ear cups do their best to mitigate this, but they can’t compensate for the sheer weight.</p>
<p>The headband is terrific. It may be my favourite approach to one that I’ve seen on a headphone. I have to wear the band further back on my head than I do with other headphones, but once I figured that out I was able to wear them for longer before needing a break. The ear cups are less impressive. They’re spacious and fairly well padded, but the material that’s used feels somewhat cheap and scratchy in texture. I suspect it’s more breathable than typical leather or vinyl ear cups, but the physical impression isn’t as good and I don’t particularly like how they feel on my face.</p>
<p>Then there’s the clamping force, which is <em>very</em> strong; AirPods Max squeeze your head like a musical bear hug. This is a common problem with heavy headphones, so I wasn’t surprised to see it here, but it accounts for the majority of the comfort problems I have.</p>
<p>The pressure points will differ depending on your fit, but I offered these to two other people in my vicinity for some extended listening and both reported discomfort; one on the top of their head, the other around their ears where the clamp force put pressure on the jaw. Personally, I experience it mainly as a headache after about the half hour to one hour mark.</p>
<p>Let’s disregard weight for a moment, though. These are fine for shorter listening sessions and everyone’s head is different, so I’m sure there are folks out there who will find them to be perfectly comfortable. The problems with metal go beyond weight: by prioritizing fashion value over practical value, Apple has committed a series of unforced errors.</p>
<p>Anodized aluminum feels nice and soft, but that softness means they scuff easily…like, say, when you fold them flat and notice that the ear cups bump and scratch against each other. This happens all the time and it makes me cringe every time; it’s like the horrible scraping that iMac users will be familiar with from trying to plug something into the rear ports. Also, parts of the world experience a season called winter, where the temperature drops and metal surfaces become dangerous things your skin will stick to.</p>
<p>Now, about that<span></span> <span>“</span>protective case”.</p>

<p>I want to save myself some typing and point you to <a href="https://youtu.be/Gvvo6vUpJRc?t=639" target="_blank">the part of <span>MKBHD</span><span></span><span>’</span>s review video</a> where he talks about the storage solution that these $900 headphones ship with. Go ahead and give that a watch. Back? Great. What he said. Before getting these, I thought the hate for the case was hyperbolic, but the truth is it really <em>does</em> feel cheap and pointless, particularly after <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886" target="_blank">Apple clarified</a> that it isn’t necessary for putting the headphones into standby mode.</p>
<p>Before we leave the topic of their physical design, I want to share one last complaint about the AirPods Max: the buttons. I don’t mind the feel of them myself (though a friend felt they were cheap and unpleasant), but I <em>do</em> mind the way they work. The Digital Crown, which controls volume, is also the button that controls playback and Siri. The other, larger button is used to switch between the listening modes: Active Noise Cancellation (<span>ANC</span>), Transparency mode, and none.</p>
<p>I appreciate having physical controls for these things, but I intuitively expected that all the audio-related functions would be accessed from one button and that the playback and feature controls would be accessed from the other. Tying playback controls to the volume knob feels strange to me, and increases the chances of unintentional volume changes when you’re trying to execute a double or triple press—something made even trickier if you’re wearing gloves.</p>
<p>There is, naturally, no way to configure these button assignments. At best, you’re able to change the scrolling direction of the volume knob and restrict which listening modes the other button switches between, but that’s about it. That latter feature also seems to be buggy in the current firmware (<span>3C16</span>) because despite enabling all three, I find that it defaults back to just Noise Cancellation or Transparency whenever I reconnect.</p>
<p>Deal-breaker? No.&nbsp;But another strange design choice to wrap up this section.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-7.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=f6b19d4c7ef961a06df1a759fc2f45b5"></p>
<p>Wait, one more complaint: the battery life is the shortest of any headphone in this category. This isn’t an issue in and of itself considering they’ll still last through a full day of listening. Still, I hoped that some of that excess size and weight would translate into battery capacity.</p>
<p>On the topic of power, Apple has indicated that the AirPods Max have two low-power states and you <em>don’t</em> need the case to access them—great news since I refuse to use that stupid thing. Here’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886" target="_blank">what they say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you set your AirPods Max down and leave them stationary for 5 minutes, they go into a low power mode to preserve battery charge. After 72 stationary hours out of the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into a lower power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My to preserve battery charge further. If you put your AirPods Max in the Smart Case when you’re not using them, they go into a low power mode immediately to preserve battery charge. After 18 hours in the Smart Case, your AirPods Max go into an ultralow power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My and maximizes battery life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, <em>now</em> I’m done talking about the physical characteristics.</p>
<h2 id="sonic-boom">Sonic Boom</h2>
<p>So there I was, shaking my head at the weight and the design while I got them connected. I was already looking up Apple’s holiday return policy when I hit play on my usual suite of test material and…oh.</p>
<p><em>Oh</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://marius.imgix.net/AirPodsMax-4.jpg?auto=compress&amp;q=75&amp;fit=clip&amp;w=1500&amp;s=a34de6bb9c7c71b5c5ccbfad05e1c8f6"></p>
<p>I was reminded of <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-bowers-wilkins-p7-wireless-headphones-review/" target="_blank">the first time</a> a pair of wireless headphones impressed me. I put them on and somehow found myself lying on the floor of my room, two hours later, having become completely lost in the music. Since then, <a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/bang-olufsen-h9i">other headphones</a> have achieved this magical time-dilation effect, but I didn’t expect to feel it coming from an Apple product.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, Apple has amazing audio engineers. <a href="https://mariusmasalar.me/airpods-pro">I adore my AirPods Pro</a>. They’re not the best value for money in terms of sound, but they have a pleasant, relatively neutral profile and have become my daily listening companions. Similarly, the HomePod is my favourite smart speaker for sound because it manages to provide a remarkably full and dynamic listening experience for a compact mono sound source.</p>
<p>In a word, the AirPods Max sound <em>sublime</em>.</p>
<p>They have a beautiful way of making you feel immersed and enveloped by the music, with a tremendously wide soundstage, solid instrument placement, and some of the most articulate dynamics I’ve heard from consumer equipment. They remind me of my open-back studio headphone and amp setup (the geeky audiophile equipment) more than other wireless headphones.</p>
<p>Several hours of listening later, I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just experiencing some sort of hallucination caused by the extreme clamping force of these metallic behemoths, so I called up my friend and had him bring over his pair of Bang &amp; Olufsen H9i—<a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/articles/a-roundup-of-the-best-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-headphones/" target="_blank">my previous benchmark</a> for best wireless <span>ANC</span> headphones—to do some critical listening.</p>
<p>We cruised through our respective music libraries, selecting favourite tracks and listening, each of us with one of the pairs on. Then we’d swap <a href="https://atp.fm/409" target="_blank">(as others have pointed …</a></p></div></div></div></div>

                      <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
                      We combine the efficiancy of convolutional approaches with
                      the expressivity of transformers by introducing a
                      convolutional <em>VQGAN</em>, which learns a codebook of
                      context-rich visual parts, whose composition is modeled
                      with an autoregressive transformer.

                <p>
  Designed to learn long-range interactions on sequential data, transformers
  continue to show state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of tasks.  In
  contrast to CNNs, they contain no inductive bias that prioritizes local
  interactions. This makes them expressive, but also computationally infeasible
  for long sequences, such as high-resolution images.  We demonstrate how
  combining the effectiveness of the inductive bias of CNNs with the
  expressivity of transformers enables
  them to model and thereby synthesize high-resolution images.
  We show how to (i) use CNNs to learn a context-rich vocabulary of
  image constituents, and in turn (ii) utilize transformers to efficiently
  model their composition within high-resolution images.
  Our approach is readily applied to conditional synthesis tasks, where both
  non-spatial information, such as object classes, and spatial information,
  such as segmentations, can
  control the generated image.
  In particular, we present the first results on semantically-guided synthesis
  of megapixel images with transformers.

Figure 2. Our approach uses a convolutional VQGAN to learn a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is subsequently modeled with an autoregressive transformer architecture. A discrete codebook provides the interface between these architectures and a patch-based discriminator enables strong compression while retaining high perceptual quality. This method introduces the efficiency of convolutional approaches to transformer based high resolution image synthesis.

For all settings, transformers outperform the state-of-the-art model from the PixelCNN family, PixelSNAIL in terms of NLL. This holds both when comparing NLL at fixed times (PixelSNAIL trains roughly 2 times faster) and when trained for a fixed number of steps. See Sec. 4.1 for the abbreviations.

Figure 8. Trade-off between negative log-likelihood (nll) and reconstruction error. While context-rich encodings obtained with large factors f allow the transformer to effectively model long-range interactions, the reconstructions capabilities and hence quality of samples suffer after a critical value (here, f = 16).

Figure 9. We compare the ability of VQVAEs and VQGANs to learn perceptually rich encodings, which allow for high-fidelity reconstructions with large factors f . Here, using the same architecture and f = 16, VQVAE reconstructions are blurry and contain little information about the image, whereas VQGAN recovers images faithfully. See also Sec. B.

  Given the ever-increasing computational costs of modern machine learning models, we need to find new ways to reuse such expert models and thus tap into the resources that have been invested in their creation. Recent work suggests that the power of these massive models is captured by the representations they learn. Therefore, we seek a model that can relate between different existing representations and propose to solve this task with a conditionally invertible network. This network demonstrates its capability by (i) providing generic transfer between diverse domains, (ii) enabling controlled content synthesis by allowing modification in other domains, and (iii) facilitating diagnosis of existing representations by translating them into interpretable domains such as images. Our domain transfer network can translate between fixed representations without having to learn or finetune them. This allows users to utilize various existing domain-specific expert models from the literature that had been trained with extensive computational resources. Experiments on diverse conditional image synthesis tasks, competitive image modification results and experiments on …</p></div></div></section></div>

  <article>
    

    

    
    <p>This blog represents a new beginning and I’m both excited and trepidatious.</p>
<p>You see, I’ve considered blogging at one time or another over the last 15-20 years, but I’ve always been too busy with more important or fun ‘stuff’. Everytime I think about it, it sounds like a great idea … and then it fizzles out.</p>
<p>I have a history of building things. Software/tech/web things that are supposed to make money. Call them micro-startups or side projects or lifestyle businesses or whatever. I’ve done a smattering of them.</p>
<p>Aside from jobs and freelancing gigs, I would spend my discretionary time on building something … that I hoped would make money. It’s great fun.</p>
<p>Except when they don’t make money. Then it’s just a time sink.</p>
<p>Of the things that I’ve tried to monetise, sometimes the results were modest. Other times, the results were mediocre or downright terrible.</p>
<p>In my most recent project, I wrote a <a href="http://www.gigobooks.com/">non-subscription accounting app</a> for people with gigs or simple affairs. I had a lot of fun writing it. And I use it for myself (ie. dogfooding) too. Awesome!</p>
<p>I’ve spent the better part of nine months building it and I’ve shipped the MVP. Problem is … Where are my users?</p>
<p>Uh, oh.</p>
<p>It’s happened again.</p>
<p>I built something. And the users aren’t coming. Even worse, this time, they don’t even know about it.</p>
<p>I have tried to get some word out and I’ve posted on various forums over the Internet. I’ve got a tiny trickle of people who visit the website and then, AFAICT, don’t come back. That’s about it. No one (other than myself) is actually using the app.</p>
<p>Granted, I didn’t spend a lot of time doing ‘marketing’ things, but I did spend <em>some</em> time, and the results have been underwhelming. It also doesn’t help that I have no pre-existing audience. No blog, no twitter followers. Nada.</p>
<p>Distribution is a hard problem. Maybe it’s sometimes even harder than writing software. Lack of distribution has killed my previous projects before. Several times. If I don’t solve this problem, it’s going to kill this latest project too.</p>
<p>So I took a step back and thought about things.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I need to learn how to do distribution. And marketing and all that other stuff.</p>
<p>I can build things, but if I can’t reach users, then what’s the point?</p>
<p>On my to-do list of marketing activities, I had ‘content marketing’ ie. writing articles and blogging. Maybe I should jump straight to it and give it a try.</p>
<p>A related thought … There are numerous posts on the Internet about people who are making X thousands of dollars N months after launching, or they do a kickstarter project and smash through the funding target.</p>
<p>The common thread? They already had an email newsletter of 3000 readers, or they had 10000 twitter followers, or they were already a well-known member of an existing forum, or something.</p>
<p>I don’t have that.</p>
<p>But if I want to solve distribution, I’m gonna need something like that. I need people who are reading what I’m writing. I need to interact with people who I can bounce ideas off. I need people who I can reach.</p>
<p>Alright. Fine.</p>
<p>Let’s give this content-marketing/blogging thing a try. Let’s learn more about ‘marketing stuff’.</p>
<p>But let’s not just read about it. Let’s do it.</p>
<p>So I’m gonna write a blog, get some practical experience at content marketing, and see how things go.</p>
<p>Either it’s going to work: The next time I launch a new project, it will be more likely to succeed as I’ll be better at distribution (hopefully).</p>
<p>Or it’s not going to work: I should stop building things and concentrate on paid work instead.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>So I’m gonna write a blog.</p>
<p>But let’s refine the idea a bit more.</p>
<p>I don’t want to do something where I’m blatantly blogging just to monetise or to push a sale. I don’t want to be a shill for my next project (whatever that might be). It’s not all just about money.</p>
<p>I want to write about stuff I’m interested in (Software, technology, startups, life, etc.). Otherwise it’ll turn in a drag and I’ll lose motivation. There has to be some intrinsic value in it too.</p>
<p>Having opened my mind to the idea of blogging, I’ve suddenly had a lot of ideas for things to write about. Things that my subconscious has always wanted to talk about but never got the chance.</p>
<p>I’m excited. Yes, it’s new and very different from building things, but it sounds like it could be fun too. (I’m also a little nervous) Hopefully, it also turns out well.</p>
<p>I spent most of nine months writing Gig’o’Books. Imagine if I spent nine months blogging. I wonder what the results would be? Only one way to find out.</p>
<p>So here I am. A new beginning. Let’s do it.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>

                <p>AWS recently introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/01/introducing-federated-amazon-eks-clusters-aws/">their new solution</a> to orchestrate Federated EKS Clusters. The solution
is based on kubefed and deploys an infrastructure with a bastion cluster to operate the clusters
and two EKS clusters in different regions. You can now have highly available EKS setup bootstrapped
using a CloudFormation template in less than an hour.</p>
<h3 id="but-first-what-is-kubefed-">But first, what is kubefed ?</h3>
<p>Kubefed (for “Kubernetes Cluster Federation”) allows to orchestrate multiple Kubernetes Cluster
by exposing a high-level control pane. Your kubernetes clusters can join the federation cluster
allowing you to create <code>Federated</code> CRDs.</p>
<p>Kubefed repository: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed">https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed</a></p>
<p>By doing so, you can create <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/userguide.md#replicaschedulingpreference">distributed deployments accross multiple clusters</a>
and even share resources such as <code>ConfigMap</code> or <code>Secret</code>.</p>
<p>Using Amazon’s Federated EKS, we will setup a kubefedctl bastion and provision two
EKS Clusters using <code>eksctl</code> to create a multi-region federated Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p><img src="https://particule.io/images/kubefed-cluster.png" alt="kubefed clusters">
<em>kubefed-based clusters concept</em></p>
<h3 id="what-is-federated-amazon-eks-">what is Federated Amazon EKS ?</h3>
<p>The Federated Amazon EKS is a solution aiming to facilitate the deployment of a kubefed-based
multi-cluster infrastructure, using CloudFormation templates. The template provides a way of
creating a bastion host that will act as the kubefed control plane.</p>
<p>This bastion will be bootrstrapped with all the necessary utilities, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>eksfedctl</code> for federation administration</li>
<li><code>eksctl</code> for cluster configuration</li>
<li><code>kubectl</code> pre-configured to be used in the federation cluster context</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation guide: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/federated-amazon-eks-clusters-on-aws/">federated-amazon-eks-clusters-on-aws</a></p>
<p>In order to setup a Federated Amazon EKS cluster, we will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the bastion host CloudFormation template</li>
<li>Run <code>eksfedctl</code> to create EKS clusters in the appropriate regions</li>
<li>Ensure the federated EKS clusters are properly setup</li>
</ul>
<p>The eksfedctl utility will automatically provision the required infrastructure, VPCs, subnets and
setup VPC peering between the bastion host’s VPC and the EKS Clusters’ VPCs.</p>

<h3 id="lets-try-it-out">let’s try it out</h3>
<p><em>Pre-requisite: Make sure you have the sufficient permissions to create the resources mentioned above.
A user policy example is available in the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/federated-amazon-eks-clusters-on-aws/master/source/solution-user-policy.json">awslabs/federated-amazon-eks-clusters</a> repository.</em></p>
<h4 id="provision-the-bastion-template">provision the bastion template</h4>
<p>The CloudFormation template for the bastion is pretty straight-forward. Beside the region,
there is no need to configure much, except some extra tags or the default bastion’s instance
type. The template is available at the following address:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/solutions-reference/federated-amazon-eks-clusters-on-aws/latest/federated-amazon-eks-clusters-on-aws.template">federated-amazon-eks-clusters-on-aws.template</a></p>
<p>The default template’s bastion is a <code>t3.micro</code> instance which will be used to provision
the EKS clusters.</p>
<h4 id="setup-your-federated-eks-clusters">setup your federated EKS clusters</h4>
<p>Once the bastion is up and running, we can access it and provision our clusters.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ tmux  # the eksfedctl executable requires to be run
$ eksfedctl create --regions us-east-1 us-east-2
</code></pre><p><code>eksfedctl</code> will take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the VPC, the subnets, peering the VPCs together</li>
<li>Creating the EKS Cluster, provisioning the instances, scaling groups</li>
<li>Configuring the EKS Clusters to join the federated cluster</li>
</ul>
<p>This might take a while, as it involves quite a few operations. Each child
CloudFormation stack is available in its own region.</p>
<p>Upon succesful termination of the <code>eksfedctl</code> command, we can observe our
freshly created clusters by running:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ kubectl -n kube-federation-system get kubefedclusters
NAME              AGE   READY
federated-eks-1   3s   True
federated-eks-2   1s   True
</code></pre><h4 id="using-the-federated-clusters">using the federated clusters</h4>
<p>We can now try out kubefed’s features, by setting a NameSpace as federated.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ kubectl create ns federate-me
namespace/federate-me created
$ kubefedctl federate ns federate-me
I0121 13:36:23.823163     843 federate.go:472] Resource to federate is a namespace. Given namespace will itself be the container for the federated namespace
I0121 13:36:23.837406     843 federate.go:501] Successfully created FederatedNamespace "federate-me/federate-me" from Namespace
</code></pre><p>Kubefed also provides the ability to propagate specific resources:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ kubectl create cm -n federate-me my-cm --from-literal=data=bob
configmap/my-cm created
$ kubefedctl -n federate-me federate configmap my-cm
I0121 13:41:12.032669     878 federate.go:501] Successfully created FederatedConfigMap "federate-me/my-cm" from ConfigMap
</code></pre><p>When using the <code>federate</code> verb, kubefed create a FederatedResource (such as a <code>FederatedConfigMap</code>)
and begins propagating the resource to the federated clusters.</p>
<p>Describing the FederatedResource allows visualising the propagation state:</p>

<p>This research work in cooperation with the University of Innsbruck marks an important step in the steady progress of quantum information processing (QIP) from a purely academic discipline towards applications throughout science and industry. Transitioning from lab-based, proof-of-concept experiments to robust, integrated realizations of QIP hardware is a crucial step in this process. Not an easy one, however, because the nature of traditional laboratory setups does not offer itself readily to scaling up system sizes or allow for applications outside of laboratory-grade environments.</p>

<div itemprop="text">
<p>Have you ever tried to publish a CDK construct that was using a Lambda function, for example to create a custom resource or provide a REST API endpoint? It’s relatively easy to publish your construct if your Lambda function is just using the AWS SDK. But it gets more complicated as soon as other dependencies are involved as well. This post will present you five different ways to bundle your Lambda function within a CDK construct and tells you about the advantages and disadvantages of each option.</p>
<h2>Problem Context</h2>
<p>Recently I started digging more into the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS CDK</a> world and wanted to build a simple single page application. I had some special requirement for which I couldn’t find an existing CDK construct available in TypeScript. So I thought let’s create it myself and publish it later to NPM. I wanted to include a Lambda function in this CDK construct that was using an external dependency apart from the AWS SDK. <strong>The problem is</strong> that if you require other dependencies in an AWS Lambda function, you need to bundle them with your function (the AWS SDK is always available for Node.js runtimes). This means, you have to create an artifact that includes all required dependencies. However, I wanted to avoid that my resulting CDK construct package gets too big. I had some ideas in my mind but also asked <a href="https://twitter.com/seeebiii/status/1348716172649361408?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDK experts on Twitter</a> for their opinion and experiences. Below are the results of my ideas and their suggestions!</p>
<p>You have another idea how to <strong>include a Lambda function in a CDK construct</strong>? Please comment below ⬇️ or let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/seeebiii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter @seeebiii</a>. If you’re curious about developing AWS Lambda functions in general, I can recommend you my article about <a href="https://www.sebastianhesse.de/2020/03/31/going-serverless-why-and-how-2/">best practices developing AWS Lambda functions</a>.</p>
<h2>Inline Code in CDK Construct</h2>
<p>The easiest solution is to write some inline code within the CDK code. It usually looks like this when using the <code><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda.Function.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Function</a></code> construct from the <code><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-readme.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@aws-cdk/aws-lambda</a></code> package:</p>
<pre><code>new Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromInline(`
    exports.handler = async (event) =&gt; {
      console.log('event: ', event)
    };
  `),
  runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_12_X
});</code></pre>
<p>This code will create a Lambda function with a very basic implementation. You can of course extend it further. However, you are a bit limited in terms of which dependencies you can include. For example, you can only refer to external dependencies like the AWS SDK and regular Node.js modules like <code>path</code> of <code>fs</code>. Also, this approach only works for runtimes that interpret text files, like Python or Node.js. It does not work for languages like Java.</p>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul><li>Quick and easy way to write a Lambda function</li><li>No extra bundle steps necessary</li></ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul><li>You are very limited what your function can do</li><li>No IDE support while writing your code</li><li>No testing possible, only manual tests</li></ul>
<h2>Separate File(s) in CDK Construct</h2>
<p>Instead of providing inline code, you can also move your Lambda function code outside of the CDK code into a separate file. Then, you just link to your file from the CDK construct your using. For example:</p>
<pre><code>new Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_12_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromAsset(`${path.resolve(__dirname)}/lambda`)
});</code></pre>
<p>The <code>code</code> property is referencing an external asset which points to the file of your Lambda function. It assumes the following folder structure:</p>
<pre><code>root/
 - my-stack.js
 - lambda/
   - index.js</code></pre>
<p>When deploying a stack with this function code, the CDK will simply take the <code>index</code> file of your Lambda function and use it as your Lambda function’s code. You can do something similar using other runtimes like Java or Python. Just reference the appropriate artifact like a JAR or Python file. Although this approach is much more preferred than writing inline code, it still has the drawback that you can not simply include other dependencies apart from the AWS SDK, at least for Node.js. You could of course zip your <code>index.js</code> file together with your <code>node_modules</code> folder and use that as your artifact. However, this approach is <strong>not recommended</strong> because it unnecessarily slows down your Lambda function due to a bigger artifact size. You’re just carrying around code which you’re not using.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul><li>Keep CDK stack code and Lambda function code separated</li><li>You can test your Lambda function’s code using automated tests</li><li>IDE support while writing your Lambda function’s code</li></ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul><li>External dependencies (apart from AWS SDK) not supported</li></ul>
<h2>Bundle Lambda Function Before Publishing</h2>
<p>If you want to use other external dependencies, you need to make sure that those dependencies are available when your Lambda function is executed. Therefore, the next logical step is to bundle your Lambda function’s code and generate a code artifact with all the dependencies included. This artifact is used by your CDK construct and in the end used by the users of your construct. In your CDK construct you still use the same <code>Function</code> definition as above where you include the code asset. However, you have to make sure to bundle your code before you publish your CDK construct to any registry like NPM. For example, if you’re writing a TypeScript Lambda function, you can use <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esbuild</a> (or webpack or similar) to compile and bundle it to “native” Node.js code that your Lambda function understands:</p>
<pre><code>esbuild lambda/index.ts --bundle --platform=node --target=node12 --external:aws-sdk --outfile=lambda/build/index.js</code></pre>
<p>This command creates an <code>index.js</code> file with all dependencies included, except the AWS SDK since this is already provided by the Lambda runtime. If you want to speed up your Lambda function even more, you can append <code>--minify</code> to use minification and reduce the output size. Here the output file is created under <code>lambda/build</code>, so take care to adjust the <code>Function</code> definition. For example:</p>
<pre><code>new Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
  runtime: Runtime.NODEJS_12_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: Code.fromAsset(`${path.resolve(__dirname)}/lambda/build`)
});</code></pre>
<p>In order to include the Lambda function’s code in your published CDK construct, consider the following:</p>
<ul><li>Make sure the <code>lambda/build</code> folder is not ignored by NPM (this is usually configured in <code>.npmignore</code>)</li><li>Before publishing the construct, you have to bundle the Lambda function first – otherwise your published construct is missing the code for your Lambda function</li></ul>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul><li>Everything from the previous section about having separate files</li><li>You don’t make any assumptions about the environment of the users that use your construct (will be important in the following sections)</li><li>You throw out all unnecessary code by only bundling the relevant code and maybe even minifying it</li></ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul><li>It takes another build step and slightly increases the size of your CDK construct</li></ul>


<h2>Bundle Lambda Function Before Deploying</h2>
<p>Instead of bundling the code before publishing your CDK construct, you can also bundle your Lambda function code before the construct is deployed to AWS. The AWS CDK provides a construct for Node.js Lambda functions called <code><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda-nodejs.NodejsFunction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NodejsFunction</a></code> from the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-nodejs-readme.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-nodejs</code> package</a>. This construct will build the Lambda function as soon as your CDK construct is deployed within a stack. The <code>NodejsFunction</code> construct is using esbuild to do that or a Docker container if esbuild is not available (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda-nodejs.NodejsFunction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read more about it in the documentation</a>). Using it in your construct is similar to how you define a regular <code><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda.Function.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Function</a></code> – however, it already defines some useful defaults. An example definition can look like this:</p>
<pre><code>new NodejsFunction(this, 'MyFunction', {
  entry: `${path.resolve(__dirname)}/lambda/index.js`
});</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it’s pretty simple and short. Unfortunately the big disadvantage is that you make assumptions about the environment where your construct is deployed. If they don’t have esbuild or Docker available, it won’t work. Therefore it only makes sense to use <code>NodejsFunction</code> in an constructs where you control the environment or if you let your users know about this requirement.</p>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<ul><li>Everything from the previous section about having separate files</li><li>You throw out all unnecessary code by only bundling the relevant code and maybe even minifying it</li></ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul><li>You make assumptions about the environment of the users of your construct</li><li>It takes another build step and slightly increases the size of your CDK construct</li></ul>
<h2>Publish Lambda Function to Serverless Application Repository or Using Docker</h2>
<p>A completely different option compared to the ones above is to use the Serverless Application Repository. It’s a repository for serverless application that you can build and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-template-publishing-applications.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publish to AWS using the SAM CLI</a>. Then you can use this application in other stacks using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-resource-application.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CloudFormation SAM type <code>AWS::Serverless::Application</code></a>. The CDK equivalent is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-sam.CfnApplication.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CfnApplication</a> from the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-sam-readme.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@aws-cdk/aws-sam</a> package. Since those applications can be made public to everyone, you have a neat way to host your Lambda function outside of your CDK construct, i.e. without bundling it inside your CDK construct. You could even <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/latest/devguide/sharing-lambda-layers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share your AWS Lambda Layer in the same way</a> and reference that instead of a full serverless application (see <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/blog-md-9bd47be8b3ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to use Layers in AWS CDK here</a>). This has the advantage that you can still use the <code>Function</code> construct as explained above and just add a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-lambda.LayerVersion.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>LayerVersion</code> construct</a>. Similarly, you can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-container-image-support-for-aws-lambda-with-aws-sam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publish your Lambda function as a container nowadays</a> and reference that in your CDK construct. The CDK provides a <code><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-lambda-readme.html#docker-images" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DockerImageFunction</a></code> for this case.</p>
<p>Although these options sound like a good idea because you are much more flexible in how your Lambda function is built, the solution has two disadvantages: First, you are referencing an unknown external stack or dependency that you should make your users aware of so they can verify it. Second, it adds much more complexity than often necessary. Especially if you’re using a Node.js runtime, none of these step should be necessary for bundling a Lambda function within your CDK construct. It’s much easier to use one of the other options above.</p>

<p>Now and then, when people hear I code economic simulations with <a href="https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD">cadCAD</a> (and I just heard about its rust cousin <a href="https://github.com/BenSchZA/radCAD">radCAD</a>), they want me to write one for them. And it usually involves asking how humans would behave in a specific situation.</p>



<p>here’s the thing</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I don’t know.</p><cite>I can’t simulate human psychology.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>What would people do in this or that case? This is not what a simulation does. A simulation says “given these conditions, and behaviours, this will happen (most/some of the time)”. One must be very clear about what these behaviours are and formulate the question in such a way that we can answer it without having to program mini-humans. Mini-humans are impossible to verify anyway.</p>



<p>Bad question: “What would humans do if I raised taxes?”<br>Better question: “How many people would stay in my system given a group of humans (with income distribution A, differing tolerances for tax raises B) and if I raised taxes above a certain threshold?”</p>



<p>You get the idea.</p>



<p>Math helps to set your intentions in stone. If you can express every interaction and change as an equation, everyone can verify that the simulation is working as intended. After all, if I write a complex system that I claim simulates how humans would behave, how is anybody going to verify that? I was probably just guessing; and it’s hard to verify if the code does what I intended. It’s far easier to test if an equation computed the right result.</p>

<p>On the 2021-01-26 qualy released this <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156/baron-samedit-heap-based-overflow-sudo.txt">article</a> describing a “new” (actually 10 year old) bug in sudo that allows an attacker to do privilege escalation though a heap buffer overflow.
Unfortunately they did not release exploit/POC so I decided to build one myself and failed. It turned out that Pewz from the CTF team bootplug had the same thought and our combined forces allowed us to successfully exploit this bug on the newest libc 2.32 in an arch environment with sudo version 1.9.4p2.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
<p>I will only briefly cover the vulnerability here as it’s quite well described in the article.</p>
<p>In an essence an attacker can overflow a heap chunk by inserting a single backslash at the end of any argv or env argument given to sudo, causing the following argument to be written out of bound. Let’s look at a simplified version of one of the code snippets from the article.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> (size <span>=</span> <span>0</span>, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; <span>*</span>av; av<span>++</span>)
  size <span>+=</span> strlen(<span>*</span>av) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;
...
<span>if</span> (size <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> (user_args <span>=</span> malloc(size)) <span>==</span> NULL) {
  <span>//do some stuff we don't care about
</span><span></span>}
...
<span>for</span> (to <span>=</span> user_args, av <span>=</span> NewArgv <span>+</span> <span>1</span>; (from <span>=</span> <span>*</span>av); av<span>++</span>) {
  <span>while</span> (<span>*</span>from) {
    <span>if</span> (from[<span>0</span>] <span>==</span> <span>'\\'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>!</span>isspace((<span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span>)from[<span>1</span>]))
      from<span>++</span>;
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span>from<span>++</span>;
    }
    <span>*</span>to<span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>' '</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>As we see in the first for loop we are iterating over each argument and finding the size (plus null terminator) of it using <code>strlen</code>. Now lets say we have the string <code>"AAAA\\"</code> (<code>\\</code> is one char).</p>
<p>The size will be 5 and it will only do an allocation of 5 bytes assuming this is the only argument.</p>
<p>In the next part we have a outer for loop over arguments and an inner loop copying the contents of all the arguments into the single buffer, <code>user_args</code>, essentially concatenating all arguments.</p>
<p>Considering the same string as before, <code>"AAAA\\"</code>, when we hit <code>from[0]=='\\'</code> we go into the if and increment <code>from</code> by <code>from++</code>, incrementing <code>from</code> so it points to the null terminator. After that we continue the loop with the next statement <code>*to++ = *from++;</code> copying the null terminator and again incrementing <code>from</code> to continue copying bytes after the null terminator we continue copying out of bounds.</p>
<p>This happens because it expects that every <code>\\</code> is followed by a meta-character, which the authors came up with a clever way of avoiding, leaving this vulnerable to a overflow. Read the article if you want to know why and how we can end up having a single <code>\\</code> in the args when entering this block.</p>
<p>By using the symbolic link <code>sudoedit</code> to <code>sudo</code> we can make this happen:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.kalmarunionen.dk/images/overflow.png" alt="sudo exploit overflowing"></p>
<h3 id="properties-of-the-overflow">Properties of the overflow</h3>
<p>The authors state 3 important properties about this overflow which make it quite powerful.</p>
<p>First and simplest we control the allocation size of <code>user_args</code> as we chose how many and how long we make the arguments to sudo.</p>
<p>Second we control the contents of the overflowed area.
This we can achieve by using the supplied environment variables. The environment variables is infact stored right after the last argument passed to <code>sudoedit</code> meaning that if we do <code>env -i 'A=BBBB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC'</code> we insert the C’s into the user_args buffer and <code>A=BBBB</code> will follow in the out of bounds area. Be aware that chunk size’s align to sizes of 0x10 so e.g. <code>env -i 'A=BB' sudoedit -s 'CCCCBBBBBBBB'</code> will only fill the buffer.</p>
<p>If you paid close attention to the inner loop in our concatenation block you probably noticed that we can exploit this multiple times. By ending a environment variable with <code>\\</code> we can make another skip to the next environment variable. So why would we like that? Because as the <code>from++</code> increments the pointer to the null terminator on the following <code>to++ = *from++;</code> it will insert that null terminator. This makes us able to insert 0x0 as well without ending the overflow making this overflow extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Example from the authors:</p>
<p><code>env -i 'AA=a\' 'B=b\' 'C=c\' 'D=d\' 'E=e\' 'F=f' sudoedit -s '1234567890123456789012\'</code></p>
<p>This will end up like this in the buffer:</p>
<pre><code>--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
  |        |        |12345678|90123456|789012.A|A=a.B=b.|C=c.D=d.|E=e.F=f.|
--|--------+--------+--------+--------|--------+--------+--------+--------+--
              size  &lt;---- user_args buffer ----&gt;  size      fd       bk
</code></pre><p>So we wont go into what forward (fd) or backwards (bk) pointers of a heap chunk mean as we are only exploiting in use memory.
Super short and oversimplified description:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first size is the size of the following chunk. It is equal to 0x10 + argument given to malloc as we also need space for size itself and alignment/previous size.</li>
<li>the next size is the contiguous chunks size.</li>
<li>fd and bk are pointers to the next and previous chunk respectively in this linked list of freed chunks. This only applies to freed chunks. Otherwise this space is available to the caller of malloc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to know more about this topic I strongly encourage you to read the <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/heap-exploitation-part-1-understanding-the-glibc-heap-implementation/">Azeria’s blog about heap exploitation</a>.</p>
<p>Now an important note to make here about the null terminator insertion I think the original paper lacks is that we can insert multiple contiguous null bytes as well.</p>
<p>First thing to understand is that environment variables don’t have to in the form of <code>SOMETHING=something_more</code>. As everything else these are just char arrays and we can do what we can with them in C. as example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>char</span> <span>*</span>args[] <span>=</span> { <span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, <span>"-s"</span>, <span>"AAAAAAAA"</span>, NULL };
<span>char</span> <span>*</span>env[] <span>=</span> { <span>"BBBBBBBB"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>"</span>, <span>"CCCCCCCC"</span>, NULL };
execve(<span>"/usr/bin/sudoedit"</span>, argv, env);
</code></pre></div><p>Here we are using execve to execute the process with full control of the environment variables.
In the inner for loop we run into the if statement at ´"\\“´ and by that skipping one char by <code>from++</code> the backslash and only inserting the null jumping onto the next ´”\\“´ and consequently inserting two null bytes in a row.</p>
<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>
<p>While the authors mention 3 possible targets here in this writeup we will only cover the second one.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>no brute-force involved in contrast to the first option where they partially overflow a function pointer defeating ASLR with brute-force.</li>
<li>They state that they did it successfully for 3 operating systems where both the other two were only one.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second option we try to overflow into a <code>service_user</code> struct stored on the heap.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> service_user
{
  <span>/* And the link to the next entry.  */</span>
  <span>struct</span> service_user <span>*</span>next;
  <span>/* Action according to result.  */</span>
  lookup_actions actions[<span>5</span>];
  <span>/* Link to the underlying library object.  */</span>
  service_library <span>*</span>library;
  <span>/* Collection of known functions.  */</span>
  <span>void</span> <span>*</span>known;
  <span>/* Name of the service (`files', `dns', `nis', ...).  */</span>
  <span>char</span> name[<span>0</span>];
} service_user;
</code></pre></div><p>This struct is used in the <code>nss_load_library</code> of libc quite often after the overflow happens for loading new dynamically linked libraries, and can we overflow the name filed then we control what library to load.
Then we can target some non privileged library we can craft that will run with the privileges of root. :-)</p>
<p>The function looks like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>static</span> <span>int</span>
<span>nss_load_library</span> (service_user <span>*</span>ni)
{
  <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>==</span> NULL)
    {
      <span>static</span> name_database default_table;
      ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>=</span> nss_new_service (service_table <span>?:</span> <span>&amp;</span>default_table,
				     ni<span>-&gt;</span>name);
      <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library <span>==</span> NULL)
	<span>return</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>;
    }

  <span>if</span> (ni<span>-&gt;</span>library<span>-&gt;</span>lib_handle <span>==</span> NULL)
    {
      <span>/* Load the shared library.  */</span>
      size_t shlen <span>=</span> (<span>7</span> <span>+</span> strlen (ni<span>-&gt;</span>name) <span>+</span> <span>3</span>
		      <span>+</span> strlen (__nss_shlib_revision) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>);
      <span>int</span> saved_errno <span>=</span> errno;
      <span>char</span> shlib_name[shlen];

      <span>/* Construct shared object name.  */</span>
      __stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (__stpcpy (shlib_name,
					      <span>"libnss_"</span>),
				    ni<span>-&gt;</span>name),
			  <span>".so"</span>),
		__nss_shlib_revision);

      ni<span>-&gt;</span>library<span>-&gt;</span>lib_handle <span>=</span> __libc_dlopen (shlib_name);
      <span>//continue long long function
</span></code></pre></div><p>The goal with this function is to hit the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle = __libc_dlopen(shlib_name)</code> loading a new library we control.</p>
<p>Here there are two things to be aware of the first the one mentioned in the article.
If <code>ni-&gt;library</code> is not <code>NULL</code> we will use that pointer in the <code>ni-&gt;library-&gt;lib_handle</code> and as ASLR is a bitch we can’t predict a valid pointer without a leak which we don’t have.
Fortunately there is a initial case for this struct where if this is null we set it by <code>ni-&gt;library = nss_new_service (...</code>. Now the multiple null byte write comes in handy!</p>
<p>Then we just need to overflow this struct all the way to it’s name field to change it to an unprivileged library we control.</p>
<p>The second challenge is that we have this next pointer <code>struct service_user *next;</code> inside the struct forming a linked list that will be traversed when the loading happens.
So if we accidentally overflow another <code>service_user</code> struct in the process we will write a garbage pointer if we overflow with fx A’s leading to a seg fault.
This can be circumvented by inserting null bytes in that spot but that creates another problem, we now break the linked list and our target struct could now be completely removed from the list leaving no pointers to it in the entire memory space.</p>
<p>This means that we have to target the first struct in the linked list that comes after our allocated area.
This turned out to be the biggest challenge to overcome as you can imagine this requires pretty good control of the heap allocation.</p>
<p>In the article they target a <code>service_user</code> with the name <code>systemd</code> which we by no means were able to target.
So we set a breakpoint just before the allocation to inspect the linked list. Then we search for <code>systemd</code> and traverse the list backwards until we find the first <code>service_user</code> close to our allocation. (Combined with some trial and error overflowing of A’s to see what struct it crashes on :-))</p>
<p>Here I show the different <code>service_user</code> names in memory and below vmmaps listed in same order. As seen on the picture the second vmmap corresponds to a systemd in the …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>Management tends to get bad rap and unfortunately many times rightfully so. Having a bad manager can make one’s life miserable and hinder their growth. Managers can seem like politicians who don’t know anything about our trade yet they give us directions.</p>
<p>On the other hand having a good manager can make you feel supported, can boost your career (and sometimes personal) growth and help make your team and company a happy place.</p>
<p>For better or worse, managers have a huge impact on their teams’ and direct report’s lives. It’s extremely important to understand some usual failure scenarios so we can course correct and provide better service and support to them.</p>
<p>Let’s see four usual ways we fail as managers.</p>
<h2 id="0-1-low-self-confidence">1. Low self-confidence</h2>
<blockquote><p>It’s not the lack of ability or opportunity that holds you back; it is only a lack of confidence in yourself.</p><p>—&nbsp;Richard Monckton Milnes</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve known much more engineering managers with low self-confidence than otherwise. Honestly, I can relate! It’s usually really hard to see our work’s positive effect, feedback loops are just too long, and cause-and-effect relations aren’t always trivial to see.</p>
<p>This is especially true for new managers, who just stepped into a completely new skill area and often try to cling to what they already know. It’s really taxing on one’s confidence to suddenly be a beginner again after previously being highly performing (engineer, many times). The end result is that we are trying to prove to ourselves (and sometimes to others, too) that we do deserve the manager role.</p>
<p>Feeling like this is entirely natural, and it can motivate us to learn and do better. Troubles start, though when this inspires the wrong kinds of behaviors in managers.</p>
<p>For one, continually demonstrating insecurity, in general, can undermine people’s confidence in us as leaders who can enforce our negative thoughts and create a vicious circle – we start noticing others don’t have much faith in us.</p>
<p>People with low self-confidence usually have a hard time saying “I don’t know”, which is essential as an engineering manager. We cling to the thought that we have to know answers to everything that comes up; otherwise, we’re just not performing well.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some insecure managers trying to do team members’ jobs. They do this not because they don’t trust their team, but they need something they’re proficient with to feel more secure and confident. This was partially the motivation for me to write one of my old posts titled&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/engineering-managers-stop-coding/">Engineering Managers, Stop Coding!</a></p>
<p>Another way for such managers to feel that they are still worth something is to be too nitpicky, for example, in code reviews or simply when giving feedback. Among many things, all this can lead to the team’s engineers feeling that their engineering manager is competing against them in a way.</p>
<p>I’ve seen another behavior of low self-confidence managers: they sometimes complain about their direct reports to other direct reports (please&nbsp;<strong>never ever</strong>&nbsp;do this!) or their manager.</p>
<p>Usually, this is only a transition period, but sometimes managers get stuck in this for years. A good support circle (the other managers in the company) and a good manager of the manager can help tremendously. Being able to discuss insecurities and fears with others can make you understand that this is normal, you’re not alone, and you can learn good coping and growth strategies from more seasoned peers.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-the-silver-bullet-aka-the-one-trick-pony">2. The silver bullet a.k.a. the one-trick pony</h2>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.</p><p>—&nbsp;Jelaluddin Rumi</p></blockquote>
<p>We might not be conscious about it, but we all have a natural, default style when it comes to management. This is shaped by our general personality, our experiences and things we’ve learnt along the way.<br>As managers, we unconsciously rely on this style, and without guidance, we tend to use that style with every direct report. Even when it becomes conscious, we justify this with ‘this is who I am’ and sometimes even with core values and our self-image (see my earlier post&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/stories-we-tell-ourselves/">Stories We Tell Ourselves</a>). Also, in many cases this style is actually the way&nbsp;<em>we</em>&nbsp;prefer to be managed.</p>
<p>While having strong core values is vital to being a successful leader, using a single management style just simply won’t work with all your direct reports over the years. Acting this way will harm some of your direct reports (and of course hinder your performance as an engineering manager, too).</p>
<p>One-trick managers often talk about the one true way to do things. They get overprotective about their style as they face more and more challenge. They often see the failure to be with the direct reports who don’t respond well to their style instead of adapting to theirs.</p>
<p>This usually shows in hiring, too – engineering managers who are stuck with one single style of leadership often prefer to hire people who are like them instead of diversifying the team.</p>
<blockquote><p>INTERVIEWER 1: I think you’ll be a really good culture fit, Dave.<br>INTERVIEWER 2: I have to say Dave, your answers really impressed us.<br>CANDIDATE: Thank you, Dave. You too, Dave.<br><a href="https://twitter.com/tef_ebooks/status/1355757158458138624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@tef_ebooks on Twitter</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These managers will have a fantastic relationship with some of the team members who’ll get most of their attention, leaving the others in the limbo a bit. These engineers who are left out will get frustrated and might end up doubting their performance if they don’t realize what’s happening.</p>
<p>As managers, it’s our core job to form a good working relationship with our direct reports. When this requires us to adapt our style or adopt new styles, it’s&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;job to do so. It’s not fair to expect our direct reports to adapt to our way of management.&nbsp;<a href="https://situational.com/situational-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Situational Leadership</a>&nbsp;is a part of this.</p>

<h2 id="2-3-too-much-business-focus-vs-too-much-people-focus">3. Too much business focus vs. too much people focus</h2>
<blockquote><p>I still believe in synergy, but I call it natural law.</p><p>—&nbsp;Barry Diller</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve all met managers who are only into business and view their direct reports as “resources”. They seemingly don’t care too much about their folks’ wellbeing and are only driven by deadlines, impact and KPIs. If the team is successful, it’ll make them happy, right?</p>
<p>We sometimes (much more rarely) see leaders who are only into the people part of their job. They create safe havens for their direct reports, try to protect them from the ‘evils’ of the world and the company and don’t seem to care about performance and business results too much. With a happy team, everything will just work out eventually, right?</p>
<p>These are obviously polar extremes – in reality, this works much more like a balance. Some business-focused managers actually do care a lot about their direct reports but firmly believe that the only way to happiness is a successful business. People-only leaders do sometimes nurture amazingly performing teams.</p>
<p>I just said ‘balance’, but I don’t view these to focuses as opposites. It’s much more about the balance of the short term and the long term. This balance manifests in many areas – solution quality vs. time to market, investing in the people vs. investing in the business, etc. etc..</p>
<p>Too much focus on the business in a leader will sometimes result in that leader prioritizing short term wins over long term ones. Such managers will talk a lot about holding people accountable. They are quick to ‘abandon’ direct reports who don’t fall in line in terms of team commitments and performance instead of coaching them and working on alignment. The sacrifice here can be tremendous: company culture suffers, and this setup won’t work in the long term. People will get burnt out and will leave. Sure, they will hire new engineers, but there’s the cost of onboarding and slowing down, lack of tenure and an overarching understanding of the product and systems and the job market will know what kind of place their company is.</p>
<p>Only focusing on the people without considering that you as a team are responsible for making the business successful can be equally detrimental. As an extreme case, a failed business won’t be able to eventually employ (as many) engineers. Individual and team success needs to align with the business’ success. Such leaders will often position themselves as gatekeepers of core values versus the rest of the company, or senior management. They will view their team as the last stand against the tides of evil.</p>
<p>This, in the end, is not about balance, I think, but rather about synergy (look, look, a buzzword!) – not building a silo of a safe haven for your team but finding a way for the individuals to grow and be successful in tandem with the business’ goals. Naturally, you need the right kind of company for this – if the company’s core values aren’t aligned with nurturing happy teams, it’ll naturally fail as a business, too. If you feel as a leader or as an individual contributor that you cannot stand by your company’s core values, by all means, do yourself the favor of finding a better place for yourself (unless you believe you can steer the company, of course).</p>

<h2 id="3-4-too-much-solving-not-enough-listening">4. Too much solving, not enough listening</h2>
<blockquote><p>I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I’m going to learn, I must do it by listening.</p><p>—&nbsp;Larry King</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly this can happen both when we’re not confident as leaders and when we are too confident. We tend to focus on solutions too much instead of supporting/empowering others or listening for more context.</p>
<p>Sometimes people only need someone to vent to and are not looking for solutions immediately.<br>Even when they are, we can act as coaches and guide them to the solutions, helping them grow in the process so that next time they will be able to solve on their own.<br>Even when they need an immediate solution, we might fail to get the whole context by not authentically listening to them.</p>
<p>Such leaders usually jump to solutions right after hearing about an issue, and even when they ask for more details and input, they are not …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Skepticism and cynicism can get in your way.</p>


<p>Back in May, I wrote <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/05/25/reading.html">Reading Research: A Guide for Software Engineers</a>, answering common questions I get about why and how to read research papers. In that post, I wrote about three modes of reading: <em>solution finding</em>, <em>discovery</em>, and <em>curiosity</em>. In subsequent conversations, I've realized there's another common issue that gets in engineers' ways when they read research, especially in the <em>discovery</em> and <em>curiosity</em> modes: too much skepticism.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The chief deficiency I see in the skeptical movement is its polarization: Us vs. Them — the sense that we have a monopoly on the truth; that those other people who believe in all these stupid doctrines are morons; that if you're sensible, you'll listen to us; and if not, to hell with you.</em> (from Carl Sagan's <em>The Demon Haunted World</em>)</p></blockquote>

<p>I could blame it on comment thread culture, racing to make that top comment pointing out errors in the paper. I could blame it on the low signal-to-noise ratio of content in general. I could blame it on poor research, poor writing, or incorrect data. But whatever is to blame, many readers approach technical content with their first goal being to find errors and mistakes, gaps in logic, or incomplete justifications of statements. When a mistake is found, the reader is justified in throwing out the whole piece of writing (<em>unreliable!</em>), the authors (<em>sloppy!</em>), their institutions (<em>clueless!</em>), or even the whole field (<em>substandard!</em>). It's also a perfect opportunity to write that comment or tweet pointing out the problems. After all, if you found the author's mistake, doesn't that make you smarter and better than the author?</p>

<p>This approach gets in the way of your ability to learn from reading. I'd encourage you to take a different one: read with the goal of finding the good stuff. Dig for the ideas, the insights, the analyses and the data points that provide value. Look for what you can learn.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that you don't carefully approach what you read. You absolutely should make sure what you believe is well-supported. Don't waste your life reading crap. Your time is too valuable for that.</p>

<p>The flip side of this is relying too much on social proof. If you open the comment thread first, you'll find that the piece you're about to read is <em>great</em> or it's <em>crap</em> or it's <em>another piece of junk published by <strong>those people</strong> (you know, them, the incompetent ones)</em>. Then, when you finally read the paper, you'll be less smart. You'll be biased towards confirming the opinions of others, rather than reading and understanding the material. I'm not against comment threads, but I never read them first.</p>

<p>Again, you can go too far in this direction. A lot of academic publishing is an exercise in social proof. Almost all the filtering we use to reduce the firehose of content down to a manageable stream depends on social proof. We use these tools because they're powerful, and scalable. But remember than popularity with Hacker News commenters, and even publication in a prestigious conference or journal, is only weak evidence of quality. Unpopularity, and rejection, are weak evidence of a lack of quality.</p>

<p><strong>An Example</strong></p>

<p>Fox and Brewer's classic paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.33.411&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Harvest, Yield, and Scalable Tolerant Systems</a> contains many great ideas. The framing of Harvest and Yield is very useful, and I've found it's had a big influence on the way that I have approached system design over the years. The first time I read it, though, I put it down. The parts describing CAP (Section 2 and 3) are confusing at best and wrong at worst (as I've <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/10/12/harvest-yield.html">blogged about before</a>). I couldn't get past them.</p>

<p>It was only after being encouraged by a colleague that I read the whole thing. Taken as a whole, it's full of great ideas. If I had kept tripping over my skepticism, and getting stuck on the bad parts, I never would have been able to learn from it.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86">virt86</a> for a few weeks now, and some of the things I decided to focus on were type safety and making good use of modern C++ features. I did many things to reduce the chances for users to shoot their own foot with the library, such as <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/d050883ee3931e6a0a74d3da9f6b948ee3cd0533/modules/core/include/virt86/platform/platform.hpp#L77">deleting move and copy constructors and assignment operators</a> from classes to make sure there is only one instance obtained from a known source, <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/d050883ee3931e6a0a74d3da9f6b948ee3cd0533/modules/core/include/virt86/vp/vp.hpp#L108">deleting</a> or <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/d050883ee3931e6a0a74d3da9f6b948ee3cd0533/modules/core/include/virt86/vm/vm.hpp#L326">hiding</a> the address operator <code>&amp;</code> so that users cannot get a pointer to objects that are not meant to be <code>delete</code>d and using <code>enum class</code> for type-safe enumerations.</p>

<p>I figured it would be interesting to use <code>enum class</code>es as bitmasks for their type-safety. Unfortunately, you cannot use them as is with bitwise operators, but you can use other C++ features to make them behave like a bitmask type.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="a-basic-version">A basic version</h2>

<p>I knew very little about <code>enum class</code>es at the time, so my first idea was to add methods to the type, assuming they would work like a <code>class</code>, however C++ disallows that. The next solution I thought of was to define operator overloads outside them, which I found out to be allowed by the language. Templates would make that even better.</p>

<p>While researching a bit about using <code>enum class</code> as bitmasks I came across a <a href="http://blog.bitwigglers.org/using-enum-classes-as-type-safe-bitmasks/">blog post</a> by Andre Haupt, which the author says is “a reiteration of a <a href="https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/cplusplus/using-enum-classes-as-bitfields.html">blog post</a> by Anthony Williams”, which is exactly the kind of solution I envisioned. The post progressively expands from a motivating example based on <code>unsigned</code> values and regular <code>enums</code>, to a simple set of overloaded operators for an specific type of enumeration, to templates which encompass every <code>enum class</code> type, finishing with SFINAE to ensure only types tagged as bitmasks actually have access to the bitwise operators.</p>

<p>I took his code and modernized it a bit by introducing an alias template for the bitmask enum type trait value and using the alias template <code>std::underlying_type_t</code>, both of which saves a bit of typing overall. Here’s my version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#define ENABLE_BITMASK_OPERATORS(x)  \
template&lt;&gt;                           \

    static const bool enable = true; \
};
</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>// ... similarly for &amp;= and ^=
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how the author demonstrated its usage, which is unchanged with my version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Permissions</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Readable</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x4</span><span>,</span> <span>Writable</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x2</span><span>,</span> <span>Executable</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x1</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>Permissions</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>  
<span>p</span> <span>|=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>;</span>  
<span>p</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>~</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>The original version falls short when it comes to another common use case for bitmasks: checking if a bitmask contains a particular bit. You have to do some convoluted and repetitive code to achieve that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>p</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has Executable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And what if we need to check if the bitmask contains at least one bit of a set of multiple bits?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Permissions</span> <span>rw</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>p</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>rw</span><span>)</span> <span>...</span> <span>??</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One way to solve this problem is to add a <code>None = 0</code> entry to the enum. Or you could resort to <code>static_cast</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Permissions</span> <span>rw</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
<span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>p</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>rw</span><span>)</span> <span>!=</span> <span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Permissions</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is still too cumbersome. Wouldn’t it be great if you could write those conditions like this?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>AllOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has Executable
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>AnyOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could even introduce new checks, such as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>NoneOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Writable, but may have other bits
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>.</span><span>AnyExcept</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Executable and has at least one of the other bits
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, we hit the same wall again: <code>enum class</code>es cannot have methods.</p>

<h2 id="enter-the-struct">Enter the struct</h2>

<p>The solution I came up with is to introduce a <code>struct</code> template which wraps an <code>enum class</code> and provides the check methods.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>template</span><span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>BitmaskEnum</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>Enum</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>Enum</span> <span>none</span> <span>=</span> <span>static_cast</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>using</span> <span>underlying</span> <span>=</span> <span>typename</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>underlying_type_t</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>

    <span>BitmaskEnum</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span> <span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>static_assert</span><span>(</span><span>is_bitmask_enum_v</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Enum</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>// ... operations here
</span><span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The basic checks we want to implement are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Any()</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains any bits</li>
  <li><code>None()</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask is empty</li>
  <li><code>AnyOf(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains one or more bits from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>AllOf(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains all bits from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>NoneOf(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask doesn’t contain any bit from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>AnyExcept(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask contains any bits excluding those from the given bitmask</li>
  <li><code>NoneExcept(Enum)</code>: <code>true</code> if the bitmask doesn’t contain any bits excluding those from the given bitmask</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be very handy to have an <code>EnumBitmask</code> to convert back into the <code>Enum</code> value or a <code>bool</code>, the latter of which is a very common use case with regular <code>enum</code>s or even <code>int</code>s to check if the bitmask has any bits set.</p>

<p>The implementations of these operations are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Here’s how to use the <code>BitmaskEnum</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Permissions</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>pBM</span> <span>=</span> <span>BitmaskEnum</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>AllOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has Executable
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>AnyOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Readable</span> <span>|</span> <span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p has at least one of Readable, Writable
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>NoneOf</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Writable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Writable, but may have other bits
</span><span>}</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pBM</span><span>.</span><span>AnyExcept</span><span>(</span><span>Permissions</span><span>::</span><span>Executable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// p does not have Executable and has at least one of the other bits
</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Much nicer and easier to understand. The best part of it? It’s a <a href="http://www.stroustrup.com/ETAPS-corrected-draft.pdf">zero overhead abstraction</a>. No runtime costs at all. Here’s a <a href="https://gist.github.com/StrikerX3/46b9058d6c61387b3f361ef9d7e00cd4">gist</a> containing a header file taken straight out of <a href="https://github.com/StrikerX3/virt86/blob/master/modules/core/include/virt86/util/bitmask_enum.hpp">virt86</a>, along with a cpp file you can use in <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> to check that this is indeed free. (Except MSVC, which still compiles every method in the struct, even though none of them are used, but the <code>test()</code> function is essentially the same.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.strikerx3.dev/assets/2.1-compiler-explorer.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.strikerx3.dev/assets/2.1-compiler-explorer.png" alt="Optimized down to a simple return!"></a><br>
<strong>Optimized down to a simple return!</strong></p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>One thing to keep in mind, however, is that it is illegal to specialize a template in a different namespace. This will happen if you define an <code>enum class</code> in a namespace and immediately use the macro still within the namespace:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>ENABLE_BITMASK_OPERATORS</span><span>(</span><span>Bar</span><span>)</span>
<span>// error: specialization of ‘template&lt;class Enum&gt; struct is_bitmask_enum’ in different namespace [-fpermissive]
</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One solution to this is to use the macro after the namespace block, referring to the <code>enum class</code> via its namespace:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>ENABLE_BITMASK_OPERATORS</span><span>(</span><span>foo</span><span>::</span><span>Bar</span><span>)</span>
<span>// good to go
</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope this helps you use the type-safe <code>enum class</code> as bitmasks more comfortably!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
    <p>I was looking for some books for these months taking into consideration that I should improve my architecture and design skills. So <a href="https://devreads.sandordargo.com/emergent-design/">I recently read Emergent Design</a> and now <a href="https://amzn.to/36rDKbh">Refactoring for Software Design Smells</a>. I don’t remember where I saw it recommended, but when I started to browse the book (I use O’Reilly), I saw it was recommended by the ACM fellow, Grady Booch. The person who authored <a href="https://amzn.to/2MBmvNU">Object-Oriented Analysis and Design With Applications</a> and who said that code should read like well-written prose. It seemed to be a good recommendation.</p>

<p>Was it worth to read the book? Let’s find it out together.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-is-technical-debt">What is technical debt?</h2>

<p>In the part of the book, the authors discuss what is technical debt, what kinds of technical debts are out there and what are their root causes.</p>

<h3 id="the-well-known-metaphor">The well-known metaphor</h3>

<p>The authors use the well-known metaphor, originally introduced by Ward Cunningham, the one that compares technical debt to financial debt.</p>

<p>You might invest in something that you don’t have money for at a given point in time, by taking on some loans. That’s possible and sometimes even desirable. But if you do so, you have to soon start paying back your debts, you have to pay the interests. If you don’t do that, if you postpone paying back your dues, the amount of interest will rise. They will keep rising until a point where they become unbearable and you have to declare bankruptcy and lose your home, your investment, etc.</p>

<p>Technical debt is like that. You can introduce some sloppy solutions to hit the market faster, to get faster feedback, but that doesn’t come for free.</p>

<p>You either pay back your technical debt, by cleaning up your code, by refactoring it, or the inevitable changes will be more difficult to implement. They can become so difficult that you simply wouldn’t even date to touch the code.</p>

<h3 id="four-kinds-of-technical-debt">Four kinds of technical debt</h3>

<p>The authors differentiate among 4 different categories of technical debt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>code debt</li>
  <li>design debt</li>
  <li>test debt</li>
  <li>documentation debt</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that test documentation debt are self-explaining categories. You either don’t write tests or documentation and therefore your level of trust in the code, your level of confidence to change it will decrease (test code), or it will be simply difficult to get relevant information about the code, about the features as you lack documentation.</p>

<p>The line between code and design bet can be thin, but in general code debt, code smells refer to much lower-level problems such as how you write a loop, how your functions are structured within a class, while design debt is more about how classes and even modules interact with each other.</p>

<p>The book focuses on the design debt, the design smells and how to remove them from a technical point of view.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-have-technical-debt">Why do we have technical debt?</h3>

<p>There are different reasons why technical debt is introduced. And just like for financial debt, there can be good and wrong reasons.</p>

<p>One cause is <strong>schedule pressure</strong>. If it’s constant and happens all the time, then it’s obviously bad and most probably you won’t take the time to fix the introduced smells. But from time to time, it can be crucial to get out to the market as fast as possible, and you can win big with it.</p>

<p>The other three reasons identified by the authors can hardly be categorized as good reasons. It’s simply bad people or bad technical management:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lack of good/skilled designers</li>
  <li>lack of application design principles</li>
  <li>lack of awareness of design smells and refactoring</li>
</ul>

<p>Management either doesn’t hire the right people for the job / the composition of the team is not a good match for the problems to tackle.</p>

<p>This book teaches about the principles of good design and makes the readers aware of the relevant design smalls and the available refactoring techniques. Though if you need more details on the refactoring techniques, you’ll have to follow up with other sources.</p>

<h2 id="design-smells">Design smells</h2>

<p>Before jumping into the details of the many different design smells, the authors lay down the foundations by stating what they mean by design smells and what characteristics they have.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Design smells are certain structures in the design that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="affected-attributes-of-a-software">Affected attributes of a software</h3>

<p>Design smells can hurt software in many different ways. In the <a href="https://amzn.to/36rDKbh">book</a>, there are seven quality attributes listed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understandability: how easy it is to understand the design of an application?</li>
  <li>Changeability: how easy it is to change the functionality of an application, or will it just break at unexpected places?</li>
  <li>Extensibility: in case of the need for new functionality arises, will it be easy to implement or…?</li>
  <li>Reusability: can you reuse some parts of the software at other places?</li>
  <li>Testability: is the design welcoming for tests or will it be a difficult challenge resulting that people will eventually stop testing?</li>
  <li>Reliability: with the design in place is easy to implement the requirements correctly? Will it help to avoid runtime issues?</li>
</ul>

<p>Later in the book, for each design smell, it’s studies which quality attributes they affect.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-main-design-principles">What are the main design principles?</h3>

<p>The authors enumerate 4 design principles and they use those to categorize the smells too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstraction: eliminate the details and generalize</li>
  <li>Encapsulation: hide the details</li>
  <li>Modularization:  Abstractions should be cohesive and loosely coupled</li>
  <li>Hierarchy: organize abstractions in clear hierarchical structures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-are-the-principles-violated">Why are the principles violated?</h3>

<p>Sometimes, <em>we simply don’t know about them</em> so we cannot take them into consideration. Other times, <em>we misunderstand them</em>. We try to create something according to a pattern we read about, but we lack the experience and we implement it in an incorrect way.</p>

<p>Often it happens that <em>we don’t think in an object-oriented way</em> and we come up with implementations that are procedural. It might be because we worked in a language where that was enforced and <em>there were strong language limitations</em> preventing the devs from using modern designs.</p>

<p>Or we simply don’t care for any reason…</p>

<h2 id="so-many-design-smells">So many design smells</h2>

<p>In the biggest part of the book, you will find 25 design smells discussed in details. The scope of this book review obviously doesn’t let me introduce you all of them, so I picked 3 design smells that I want to mention.</p>

<h3 id="imperative-abstraction">Imperative Abstraction</h3>

<p>I choose this one because that’s something I regularly do myself. I turn operations into classes.</p>

<p>You can recognize this smell when there is only one - public - method defined within the class. Even worse, the class name and the method name might be the same. In C++, sometimes I just override the <code>operator()</code> to get rid of this problem.</p>

<p>As a solution, the authors suggest to move such an operation to the abstraction that uses it, often there is only one user of this class/method.</p>

<p>By that, the design becomes cleaner and less complex.</p>

<p>When I offend this role, it’s often because I have to fix some legacy code and I have no time, to do major a refactoring, but I want to extract some behaviour, in fact, an operation, so that I can easily test it.</p>

<p>I understand it would be better to extract the data along with the behaviour so that they constitute a cohesive entity, even though it takes more effort to refactor that way.</p>

<h3 id="multifaceted-abstraction">Multifaceted Abstraction</h3>

<p>This is something that happens a lot. We see it everywhere and we also contribute with our fair share to worsen the situation.</p>

<p>A multifaceted abstraction has a too wide API, it has too many responsibilities. In fact, it’s an offence against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.</p>

<p>The authors bring many examples, even from the core of Java SDK libraries.</p>

<p>The solution is quite straightforward, but of course, not so easy to carry out all the time: extract classes, divide them into smaller, cohesive abstractions.</p>

<h3 id="deficient-encapsulation">Deficient Encapsulation</h3>

<p>Do you automatically create a pair of getters and setters for the members of a class? Some IDEs will even help you do that.</p>

<p>With that, you’ll leak many implementation details. Details that the clients of the class should not depend on.</p>

<p>The problem is that it’s quite difficult to change the situation. You might also know this as <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s law</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a sufficient number of users of an API,
it does not matter what you promise in the contract:
all observable behaviours of your system
will be depended on by somebody.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often, it’s compelling to make internal methods publicly accessible for the sake of testability, but if you have to do that, it only means that your design is bad.</p>

<p>You have to take into consideration the effects. Often, if you work in an internal codebase, it will be an acceptable compromise. You expose a method, you make it testable and you know that the external world will have no access to it. But if you’d it a library used by many, you should really look for another solution.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/36rDKbh">Refactoring for Software Design Smells</a> the authors explain what 4 design principles should we use to achieve a high-quality design and what are the main reasons behind failure to achieve it.</p>

<p>Then they analyze 25 design smells categorized by the 4 design principles. For each we read about how they appear, what quality attributes they hurt and what can we do about them.</p>

<p>If you are looking for levelling up your software design knowledge, I think this book is worth to read. You’ll realize how many smells you also introduce to your code with the best intention and you’ll also get some recipes on how to avoid them.</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>

<p>UUID also known as GUID is an alternative primary key type for SQL databases. It offers some non-obvious advantages compared to standard integer-based keys. Phoenix provides reliable support for working with UUID using its Ecto PostgreSQL adapter. In this tutorial, we will dive deep into UUIDs with all their cons and pros.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-uuids-instead-of-integers">Benefits of using UUIDs instead of integers</h2>
<p>UUID is a random string in a predefined format. Sample value looks like that:</p>
<p><code>ccbb63c0-a8cd-47b7-8445-5d85e9c80977</code></p>
<p>UUID is superior to integer-based primary keys in many ways. One caveat might be the size of database indexes, but for non-big-data tables, you shouldn’t notice the difference between integers and UUIDs.</p>


<h3 id="exposing-non-public-information-in-urls">Exposing non-public information in URLs</h3>
<p>A primary key value is usually publicly discoverable in URLs and API network logs. In turn, everyone can roughly estimate the app’s resources, total number, and pace of growth. Do you really want to expose how many users are signing up to your service or how many products you are selling with public URLs like:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>/orders/2234/checkout
/users/287/profile
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This issue could be mitigated by adding slugs, but these are just duplicated unique keys with additional maintenance required.</p>
<p>Switching to UUID results in URLs that don’t expose any potentially confidential information:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>/orders/cc7a4c8b-1a90-4287-a983-3f6e10bd88d4/checkout
/users/6b6cabb3-e37d-4dd1-ae18-a4eb893b07ae/profile
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="access-scoping-bugs">Access scoping bugs</h3>
<p>Properly scoping access to resources in web apps with non-trivial business logic is hard. It’s possible to ship code like:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>InvoiceController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"</span><span>id"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>id</span><span>})</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>invoice</span> <span>=</span> <span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>Invoice</span><span>,</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span>

    <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>show.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>invoice:</span> <span>invoice</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>instead of:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourAppWeb</span><span>.</span><span>InvoiceController</span> <span>do</span>
  <span># ...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>show</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"</span><span>id"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>id</span><span>},</span> <span>current_user</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>invoice</span> <span>=</span> <span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>one</span><span>(</span>
                <span>from</span> <span>a</span> <span>in</span> <span>Invoice</span><span>,</span>
                <span>where:</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>==</span> <span>^</span><span>id</span> <span>and</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>==</span> <span>^</span><span>current_user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
              <span>)</span>

    <span>render</span><span>(</span><span>conn</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>show.html"</span><span>,</span> <span>invoice:</span> <span>invoice</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This example might seem obvious, but in apps with multiple user roles and complex logic for who can access what, it’s not always possible to completely prevent similar mistakes.</p>
<p>If invoice ID was a UUID type in the above example, it would make it impossible for an attacker to sequentially scan integer ID values looking for a security hole. This simple change makes a range of potential security bugs extremely unlikely to exploit.</p>
<p>By no means, I claim that using UUID releases you from the necessity to scope access to resources in your web app. Still, it might save you in case a similar security loophole was discovered in your project.</p>
<h3 id="frontend-independence">Frontend “independence”</h3>
<p>UUID primary keys allow frontend applications to independently generate new objects, together with IDs, without talking to the backend. A unique ID can be created using the JavaScript code, and the chances of collision with already existing objects are negligible.</p>
<p>This approach opens up a whole array of possibilities for frontend developers, e.g., to batch create objects together with their associations without the overhead of API calls.</p>
<h2 id="uuid-formats-in-elixir-ecto">UUID formats in Elixir Ecto</h2>
<p>You can generate UUID with Elixir by running:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>()</span>
<span># "b436517a-e294-4211-8312-8576933f2db1"</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Under the hood string format of UUID is converted to binary when interacting with the database layer. To generate a sample binary UUID run:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>bingenerate</span><span>()</span>
<span># &lt;&lt;72, 143, 56, 198, 127, 12, 78, 152, 141, 149, 101, 55, 70, 15, 236, 224&gt;&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>You can convert one format to another in the following way:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>dump</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>b436517a-e294-4211-8312-8576933f2db1"</span><span>)</span>

<span># {:ok, &lt;&lt;180, 54, 81, 122, 226, 148, 66, 17, 131, 18, 133, 118, 147, 63, 45, 177&gt;&gt;}</span>

<span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>180</span><span>,</span> <span>54</span><span>,</span> <span>81</span><span>,</span> <span>122</span><span>,</span> <span>226</span><span>,</span> <span>148</span><span>,</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>17</span><span>,</span> <span>131</span><span>,</span> <span>18</span><span>,</span> <span>133</span><span>,</span> <span>118</span><span>,</span> <span>147</span><span>,</span> <span>63</span><span>,</span> <span>45</span><span>,</span> <span>177</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>)</span>

<span># {:ok, "b436517a-e294-4211-8312-8576933f2db1"}</span></code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="how-to-start-using-uuid-in-elixir-phoenix-apps">How to start using UUID in Elixir Phoenix apps</h2>
<p>First, generate the following migration:</p>
<p><code>priv/repo/migrations/20201217143615_create_users.exs</code></p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourApp</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>Migrations</span><span>.</span><span>CreateUsers</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>change</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>create</span> <span>table</span><span>(</span><span>:users</span><span>,</span> <span>primary_key:</span> <span>false</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>add</span> <span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>:uuid</span><span>,</span> <span>primary_key:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>null:</span> <span>false</span>

      <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Don’t forget to run it:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">mix ecto.migrate</code></pre></figure>
<p>Now add the corresponding schema module:</p>
<p><code>lib/your_app/accounts/user.ex</code></p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourApp</span><span>.</span><span>Accounts</span><span>.</span><span>User</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>Schema</span>
  <span>import</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>Changeset</span>

  <span>@primary_key</span> <span>{</span><span>:id</span><span>,</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>UUID</span><span>,</span> <span>autogenerate:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span>

  <span>schema</span> <span>"</span><span>users"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>timestamps</span><span>()</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>You can use string UUID format when building queries. Just remember always to prefix even the literal values with <code>^</code> because otherwise, you’ll get a somewhat cryptic error:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span># Incorrect</span>

<h3 id="generating-uuid-using-postgresql-function">Generating UUID using PostgreSQL function</h3>
<p><code>autogenerate: true</code> configures Ecto to generate random UUID values for newly created objects. Alternatively, you could generate UUIDs at the PostgreSQL level by editing your migration like that:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>YourApp</span><span>.</span><span>Repo</span><span>.</span><span>Migrations</span><span>.</span><span>CreateUsers</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> <span>Ecto</span><span>.</span><span>Migration</span>

    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>If you decide to do it, remember to use the <code>returning</code> option when inserting new objects. Without it, Ecto would not fetch default column values generated by PostgreSQL functions.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir">  <span>def</span> <span>create_user</span><span>(</span><span>attrs</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

<h3 id="using-uuid-as-a-default">Using UUID as a default</h3>
<p>If you’re starting a new project and would like all your schemas to leverage UUIDs for primary keys without customizing their migrations, you need to add the following line to your config file.</p>
<p><code>config/config.exs</code></p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>config</span> <span>:your_app</span><span>,</span> <span>yourapp</span><span>.</span><span>repo</span><span>,</span> <span>migration_primary_key:</span> <span>[</span><span>type:</span> <span>:uuid</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>If you did not create the project yet, you could use a <code>--binary-id</code> flag to configure it automatically:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-migrate-a-table-from-integer-to-uuid-primary-key">How to migrate a table from integer to UUID primary key?</h2>
<p>Changing the primary key type in the table is not straightforward. You need to start by running a similar migration that will create a new <code>uuid</code> column. Then rename the old <code>id</code> column to <code>integer_id</code>, unset it as the primary key in favor of the new <code>uuid</code> column after renaming it to <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>I will not detail how to migrate associations because it will differ for every use case. You need to follow the similar steps of adding a new GUID type column and based on the value from the old integer foreign key, you must assign correct UUID keys.</p>
<h2 id="caveats-of-working-with-uuid">Caveats of working with UUID</h2>
<h3 id="binary-logs">Binary logs</h3>
<p>You only need the string format to construct the UUID queries. Unfortunately, currently, Ecto displays the binary format in the logs, so you’ll need to do the manual conversion to work with them. I’ve <a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto_sql/pull/292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opened a PR</a> trying to improve it.</p>

<h3 id="implicit-ordering-issue">Implicit ordering issue</h3>
<p><code>first</code> and <code>last</code> Query.API methods may seem broken when used with UUIDs. By default, they sort objects based on their primary key.</p>
<p>Integer primary keys are generated sequentially. We can assume that the most recently created object will have the highest ID value.</p>
<p>On the contrary, due to UUID’s totally random nature, it is generated in a non-sequential order. PostgreSQL can still sort them using the deterministic algorithm. It means that a single UUID from the table will always have a first place when sorting. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with when it was generated compared to other UUID values from the same table.</p>
<p>It results in a seemingly buggy behavior of first and last methods. To remediate that, make sure to always explicitly pass the column name by which you want to sort your collection. In most cases, you’ll probably want to use <code>inserted_at</code> instead of <code>id</code>. One catch here is that the <code>inserted_at</code> column is not guaranteed to be unique. To avoid inconsistent results, always make sure to subsort your results by primary key:</p>

<p>BTW you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/pawurb/ecto_extras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EctoExtras package</a>.

<h2 id="what-is-axios"><a href="#what-is-axios" aria-label="what is axios permalink"></a>What is Axios?</h2>
<p>Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It comes with many useful defaults like automatically detecting JSON responses and returning an object instead of plain text, throwing an error if the response status code is greater than 400.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-axios-interceptor"><a href="#what-is-an-axios-interceptor" aria-label="what is an axios interceptor permalink"></a>What is an axios interceptor?</h2>
<p>An Axios  <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors">interceptor</a>  is a function that the library calls every time it sends or receives the request. You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by “then” or “catch”.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>
axios<span>.</span>interceptors<span>.</span>request<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>config</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> config<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>reject</span><span>(</span>error<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


axios<span>.</span>interceptors<span>.</span>response<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    
    <span>return</span> response<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    
    <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>reject</span><span>(</span>error<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also remove the interceptor from Axios.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> myInterceptor <span>=</span> axios<span>.</span>interceptors<span>.</span>request<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
axios<span>.</span>interceptors<span>.</span>request<span>.</span><span>eject</span><span>(</span>myInterceptor<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>There is a big chance when building an app that you will use an API that requires some credentials like api_token or a user Auth token. Usually, you will have to append the required headers with every HTTP request you make. Using Axios interceptors, you can set this up once, and anywhere you call your Axios instance, you are sure that the token is there.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code>axios<span>.</span>interceptors<span>.</span>request<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>req</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  
  
  req<span>.</span>headers<span>.</span>authorization <span>=</span> ‘Bearer mytoken’<span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> req<span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>



<span>const</span> res <span>=</span> <span>await</span> axios<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>‘https<span>:</span><span>/</span><span>/</span>api<span>.</span>example<span>.</span>com’<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="log-every-request-and-response-using-interceptors"><a href="#log-every-request-and-response-using-interceptors" aria-label="log every request and response using interceptors permalink"></a>Log every request and response using interceptors.</h2>
<p>Logging requests can be beneficial, especially when you have a large app and you don’t know where all your requests are triggered. Using an Axios interceptor, you can log every request and response quickly.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> axios <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span>‘axios’<span>)</span><span>;</span>

axios<span>.</span>interceptors<span>.</span>request<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>req</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> req<span>;</span>

<h2 id="error-handling-using-axios-interceptors"><a href="#error-handling-using-axios-interceptors" aria-label="error handling using axios interceptors permalink"></a>Error handling using Axios interceptors</h2>
<p>You can use An Axios interceptor to capture all errors and enhance them before reaching your end user. If you use multiple APIs with different error object shapes, you can use an interceptor to transform them into a standard structure.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> axios <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span>‘axios’<span>)</span><span>;</span>
axios<span>.</span>interceptors<span>.</span>response<span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span>

<p>Backend resources are limited and can cost a lot of money. As a client, you help reduce the load on your server by rate-limiting your HTTP calls.
Here’s how you can do it using an Axios interceptor.</p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>const</span> axios <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span>‘axios’<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<p>This will take you less than 5 minutes to get a private VPN on your own Ubuntu server.</p>
<p>What you need to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>a VPS (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS preferrably)</li>
<li>docker and docker-compose installed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="setting-up-docker-compose"><a href="#setting-up-docker-compose">#</a> Setting up docker-compose</h2>
<p>On the VPS, I suggest to do the following:</p>
<p>Create a folder <code>wireguard/config</code> in your $HOME:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p wireguard/config
</code></pre>
<p>Inside the <code>wireguard</code> folder (next to the <code>config</code> folder), create the docker-compose file:</p>
<pre><code>vim docker-compose.yml
</code></pre>
<p>With the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>version: "2.1"
services:
  wireguard:
    image: linuxserver/wireguard
    container_name: wireguard
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/Rome
      - SERVERURL=YOUR_IP_OR_DNS_NAME_OF_YOUR_SERVER #optional
      - SERVERPORT=51820
      - PEERS=5
    volumes:
      - /home/YOUR_USERNAME/wireguard/config:/config
      - /lib/modules:/lib/modules
    ports:
      - 51820:51820/udp
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    restart: always
</code></pre>
<p>Simply change the <code>SERVERURL</code> variable, or delete that line if you want to use the server IP.</p>
<p>Additionally, change the location of your wireguard config path in the <code>volumes</code> section. (use <code>pwd</code> to get the current path you are in).</p>
<p><strong>For more info and environment variables, check out the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireguard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">linuxserver/wireguard doc</a>.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve used <code>restart: always</code> so that WireGuard comes up after a system restart.</p>
<p>Changed <code>PEERS</code> to 5, so that I have 5 configurations available for my devices.</p>
<h2 id="launching-the-container"><a href="#launching-the-container">#</a> Launching the container</h2>
<p>Start the container in the background with</p>
<pre><code>docker-compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the needed configurations in the <code>wireguard/config</code> folder.</p>
<p>The structure of your <code>wireguard</code> folder looks something like this</p>
<pre><code>.
├── config
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── coredns
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── Corefile
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer1.conf
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer1.png
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── privatekey-peer1

│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── templates
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── peer.conf
│&nbsp;&nbsp; │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── server.conf
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── wg0.conf
└── docker-compose.yml
</code></pre>
<h2 id="firewall-configuration"><a href="#firewall-configuration">#</a> Firewall configuration</h2>
<p>If you’re using <code>ufw</code>, simply enable the port <code>51820</code> so that you can connect to your server from outside:</p>
<pre><code>ufw enable 51820
ufw reload
</code></pre>
<p>If you run <code>sudo ufw status</code> you should see:</p>
<pre><code>Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ---      ----
....................................................

51820 (v6)                 ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="connecting-devices"><a href="#connecting-devices">#</a> Connecting devices</h2>
<p>Now you can <code>cat</code> or <code>scp</code> the configurations individually to your devices.</p>
<p>The configurations are located in the <code>config/peerX</code> folder, where <code>X</code> represents the peer number.</p>
<p>E.g. I could <code>cat/scp</code> the configuration in <code>wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.conf</code> and put it in <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code> on my host machine.</p>
<p>View the configuration for peer 1 on your server with</p>
<pre><code>cat /home/YOUR_USERNAME/wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.conf
</code></pre>
<p>and place it in <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code> on your host machine.</p>
<p>If you want to use <code>scp</code>, you could run the following on your local machine:</p>
<pre><code>scp <a href="https://cri.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="306563756270637562667562">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/wireguard/config/peer1/peer1.conf /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
</code></pre>
<p>To connect to your newly created WireGuard VPN from one of your devices, you’ll need to install <code>wireguard-tools</code>.</p>
<p>E.g. <code>apt install wireguard-tools</code> , <code>pacman -S wireguad-tools</code> based on your distro</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener external">Here you can find a more detailed explanation</a></p>
<p>Now you can simply run <strong><code>wg-quick up wg0</code></strong> and you’re connected to your VPN.</p>
<p>Test it out by running <code>curl ipinfo.io</code> and inspect the output.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-mobile-device-with-qr-code"><a href="#connecting-mobile-device-with-qr-code">#</a> Connecting mobile device with QR code</h2>
<p>On your mobile device, install the WireGuard client.</p>
<p>Then add a new WireGuard tunnel by creating a new configuration scanning a QR code.</p>
<p>On your VPS run the following to output a QR code on the terminal that you can scan on your mobile device:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -it wireguard app/show-peer 1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="inspecting-connections"><a href="#inspecting-connections">#</a> Inspecting connections</h2>
<p>If you want to understand who is connected and which profiles are in use, simply run the following on your VPS:</p>
<pre><code>docker exec -it wireguard wg
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you more information about your connections with the following output:</p>
<pre><code>interface: wg0
  public key: (redacted)
  private key: (hidden)
  listening port: 51820

peer: (redacted)
  endpoint: (redacted):51820

  latest handshake: 27 seconds ago
  transfer: 5.04 MiB received, 172.64 MiB sent

...

peer: (redacted)
  allowed ips: (redacted)/32
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a> Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was most definitely the easiest way I found to connect computers and mobile devices to your own WireGuard VPN.</p>
<p>Let me know if you had troubles setting it up yourself!</p>

              <p>DynASM is a preprocessor and tiny runtime library for creating assemblers and JIT compilers in C or C++.</p>
        <p>DynASM was written for, and is maintained as part of, <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</a>. LuaJIT 1 used
           DynASM in a JIT role. LuaJIT 2 doesn't use DymASM in a JIT role, but LuaJIT 2's interpreter is hand-written in assembly,
           and it uses DynASM as a powerful cross-platform assembler.</p>
        <p>To get the latest copy of DymASM, run the following:</p>
        <pre><span>git clone http://luajit.org/git/luajit-2.0.git</span>
<span>cd luajit-2.0/dynasm</span></pre>
        <p>The <a href="http://luajit.org/dynasm.html">official documentation</a> for DynASM is extremely spartan, which can
           make it difficult to get started with DynASM. For using DynASM in a JIT role, this unofficial documentation's
           <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/tutorial.html">tutorial</a></strong> is recommended as a starting point. Once you're more familiar with DynASM,
           the <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/reference.html">reference</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://corsix.github.io/dynasm-doc/instructions.html">instruction listing</a></strong>
           pages are recommended reading for fleshing out your DynASM knowledge.</p>
        <p>Note that DynASM supports the x86, x64, ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS instruction sets, but this unofficial documentation
           only covers x86 and x64.</p>

I ruled out Google Analytics as they sustain little issues with privacy, and it does not fit into the mentioned attributes. So, what's out there in the market? Until this point, I've come across the following:</p><ul><li>umami (self-hosted, open source),</li><li>Simple Analytics (paid),</li><li>Fathom Analytics (paid),</li><li>Splitbee (paid),</li><li>and Plausible (paid or self-hosted, open source)</li></ul><p>If possible, I'd rather avoid a paid service (at least for now). Having used umami for a client project recently being quite fond of it, I've moved to <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plausible</a>, an open-source project based in the European Union, for this project. Plausible offers a pretty clean <a href="https://github.com/plausible/hosting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-hosting setup via Docker</a>. Alternatively, they offer a paid managed service on their platform for those who prefer.</p><p>Either via plausible.io or self-hosted - after creating your site in the Plausible dashboard you're provided with a simple <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag looking somewhat like this:</p><pre><p><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>async</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>defer</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>data-domain</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>johnschmidt.de</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>https://stats.johnschmidt.cloud/js/plausible.js</span><span>"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>/&gt;</span></p></pre><p>Of course the <code>src</code> and <code>data-domain</code> attributes might differ depending on your setup. That's all you need from Plausible itself.</p><h2 id="setting-up-your-application">Setting up Your Application<a href="#setting-up-your-application"><span>Anchor link for: <!-- -->Setting up Your Application</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 256 256"><rect width="256" height="256" fill="none"></rect><line x1="43.63636" y1="96" x2="224" y2="96" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="176" y1="40" x2="144" y2="216" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="112" y1="40" x2="80" y2="216" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="32" y1="160" x2="212.36376" y2="160" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line></svg></a></h2><p>In your Next.js project we need to modify the <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom document</a> <code>/pages/_document.js</code> file.

However, there is a <a href="https://github.com/4lejandrito/next-plausible" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small package</a> providing you with a <code>&lt;PlausibleProvider&gt;</code> wrapper.

The script will be included into the app bundle on every page. Once deployed, the script will automatically run the tracker function and count visitors and page views. The results will be displayed in the Plausible dashboard almost instantly.</p><h2 id="avoiding-counts-in-preview-deployments">Avoiding Counts in Preview Deployments<a href="#avoiding-counts-in-preview-deployments"><span>Anchor link for: <!-- -->Avoiding Counts in Preview Deployments</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 256 256"><rect width="256" height="256" fill="none"></rect><line x1="43.63636" y1="96" x2="224" y2="96" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="176" y1="40" x2="144" y2="216" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="112" y1="40" x2="80" y2="216" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="32" y1="160" x2="212.36376" y2="160" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line></svg></a></h2><p><em>There's just this one little caveat: </em>Plausible does not differ between the domain or referring URL (yet) you call the script from. Using Vercel or Netlify for your deployments, you might use preview URLs quite frequently. A visit to one of these would trigger an event like in the production environment. As far as I could evaluate, there's essentially two options to avoid:</p><ol><li>exclude yourself from tracking on the client-side or</li><li>include the script only on the desired production URL (e.g. johnschmidt.de)</li></ol><p>The First option could be achieved with a custom rule in a script-blocking extension of sorts (e.g. uBlock, Adblock Plus).  The second approach is a bit trickier at the moment. To avoid the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to render in the preview URLs we need to include the snippet conditionally, based on the current hostname. The <code>Window</code> object can provide this information quite simply in <code>window.location.hostname</code>. It'll be offered as a string. This moves the code from <code>/pages/_document.js</code> to <code>/pages/_app.js</code> since we need to check our conditions on the client-side.</p><pre><p><span>import</span><span> Head </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'next/head'</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>HomepageApp</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span> Component</span><span>,</span><span> pageProps </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Head</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>{</span><span>typeof</span><span> window </span><span>!==</span><span> </span><span>'undefined'</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          window</span><span>.</span><span>location</span><span>.</span><span>hostname </span><span>===</span><span> </span><span>'johnschmidt.de'</span><span> </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>async</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>defer</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>data-domain</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>johnschmidt.de</span><span>'</span><span></span></p><p><span>              </span><span>src</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>https://stats.johnschmidt.cloud/js/plausible.js</span><span>'</span><span></span></p><p><span>            </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>          </span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Head</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>&lt;</span><span>Component</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>...</span><span>pageProps</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> HomepageApp</span></p></pre><p>Before reading the <code>window.location.hostname</code> parameter we need to make sure that it is only called in a client-side setting. We can check if the <code>Window</code> object is defined and render the script tag conditionally. Since Next.js statically generates our page on the server-side, it would try to call the <code>Window</code> object in a Node.js environment - albeit <code>Window</code> does not exist there. Once a visitor opens our app on the production URL, the script should be rendered on hydration and Plausible can start collecting your events as usual.</p><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up<a href="#wrapping-up"><span>Anchor link for: <!-- -->Wrapping up</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 256 256"><rect width="256" height="256" fill="none"></rect><line x1="43.63636" y1="96" x2="224" y2="96" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="176" y1="40" x2="144" y2="216" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="112" y1="40" x2="80" y2="216" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line><line x1="32" y1="160" x2="212.36376" y2="160" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="24"></line></svg></a></h2><p>Plausible provides a good alternative to Google Analytics, especially on the privacy side of things. The only downside is the fairly narrow adjustability within a continuous deployment environment like Vercel or Netlify. With a little tweak, however, it can work like a charm. For a small project like this homepage, it seemed like one of the best solutions to get lightweight stats and baseline analytics.</p><p>Since this is my first post of this kind, let me know if this post was helpful to you and reach out <a href="https://twitter.com/jope_sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to me on Twitter</a> (@jope_sh) with feedback and ideas!</p></div></div>]]>

particularly if you're trying to translate Hooks to lifecycle methods in class components.</p><p>You read everywhere that you <em>shouldn't</em> compare useEffect to lifecycle methods, but then where do you start?</p><p>Thankfully, not knowing how useEffect's clean-up function works isn't as bad as getting the <a href="https://maxrozen.com/learn-useeffect-dependency-array-react-hooks">dependency

		<p>Another day, another post telling me to do something, or not do something, or adopt some technology, or not adopt some technology, or whatever it is that they want me to do, because it makes it easier to “reason about the code”.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>More precisely, it’s a thought-terminating cliche. Ironic, as the phrase “reason about” is used as a highfalutin synonym for “think about”. The idea is that there’s nowhere to go from here. I want to do things one way, some random on medium dot com wants me to do things another way, their way makes it easier to reason about the code, therefore that’s the better approach.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the fact that people don’t think—sorry, reason—about things the same way. If we did, then there’d be little point to things like film review sites, code style guides, or democracy. We don’t know precisely <em>what</em> influences different people to think in different ways about different things, but we have some ideas. Some of the ideas just raise other questions: like if you say “it’s a cultural difference” then we have to ask “well, why is it normal for all of the people in that culture to think this way, and all of the people in this culture to think that way?”</p>
<p>This difference between modes of thought arises in computing. We know, for example, that you can basically use any programming language for basically any purpose, because back in the days when there were intellectual giants in computering they demonstrated that all of these languages are interchangeable. They did so before we’d designed the languages. So choice of programming language is arbitrary, unless motivated by external circumstances like which vendor your CTO plays squash with or whether you are by nature populist or contrarian.</p>
<p>Such differences arise elsewhere than in choice of language. Comprehension of paradigms, for example: the Smalltalk folks noticed it was easier to teach object-oriented programming to children than to professional programmers, because the professional programmers already had mental toolkits for comprehending programming that didn’t integrate with the object model. It’s easier for them to “reason about” imperative code than objects.</p>
<p>OK, so when someone says that something makes it easier to “reason about” the code, what they mean is that <em>that person</em> find it easier to think about code in the presence of this property. I mean, assuming they <em>do</em>, and are not disingenuously proposing a suggestion that you do something when they’ve run out of reasons you should do it but still think it’d be a good idea.  But wait.</p>
<p>It’s a scam.</p>
<p>Code is a particular representation of, at best, <em>yesterday’s</em> understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve. “Reasoning about code” is by necessity accidental complexity: it’s reflecting on and trying to understand a historical solution of the problem as you once thought it was. That’s effort that could better be focussed on checking whether your understanding of the problem is indeed correct, or needs updating. Or on capturing a solution to an up-to-the-minute model of the problem in executable form.</p>
<p>This points to a need for code to be <em>deletable</em> way faster than it needs to be thought about.</p>
<p>Reasoning about code is a scam.</p>

				SSD`s are the life blood of our fmadio 10G, 40G, 100G ethernet capture systems. They provide backing storage that well exceeds that of conventional RAM, are super fast and light weight. Thus its prudent to keep the SSD farms in top nick, optimal health, and occasionally perform emergency room brain surgery on them. Unfortunately today is one of those days.

As with all things, it happened late on a Friday night when I was adding a new feature to the system that wipes all capture data from the system. This is simple button click on the web UI page as our clients data is quite sensitive thus needs to be deleted when the box moves internally or externally. The wipe is implemented using the "Secure Erase" ATA-8 command, you can read all about it <a href="https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/ATA_Secure_Erase">here</a>. Its essentially a restore-to-factory-setting operation. Meaning after the SecureErase the drive`s internal state is the same as "just left the factory". 
		</p>
		
		<p>
Which is great when it works, but this kind of low level drive formatting is pretty complicated with many (presumably) asynchronous operations going on in parallel... and doing 100 of these operations back to back at high speed is probably something the vendor did not expect (I was testing dammit!). In our case this bricked 6 SSD`s rendering them completely useless causing myself quite the stress as I now have several thousand dollars worth of inventory destroyed!  - not a good day.

The usual suspects to recover were tried and failed, leaving only a few options.
<br>
</p>

<h5>a) RMA the boards back to the seller<br>
b) Contact vendor support<br>
c) Perform surgery</h5>


<p>
Option a) of RMA`ing the boards was the safest option, tho usually you get some other previously recycled RMA`ed device back. Option b) of contacting the vendor is always such a brutally painful experience. It would likely end up with some random "Customer Support" person with a strange accent... giving the default completely useless response of RMA the device and get a replacement kind of thing... ho hum. Which leaves surgery! Now I usually don't go messing with hardware like this (anymore... :) ) because it takes up quite a bit time. However SSD health and prosperity is directly linked to our profitability thus deemed it a worth while time investment to have a more intimate relationship with our SSD models of choice. 
</p>
<br>

<div><p>
The process starts with a general reconnaissance mission of what pins are accessible, and what those pins are for. First up was finding the UART / serial interface but it was silent and likely disabled by the firmware. Next up was what most likely looked like a JTAG interface and... bingo, full JTAG interface connecting and operating as expected.
</p><p>

 JTAG is a hardware based system debugger that for CPU`s let you control instruction execution and read/write memory anywhere. You can see in the picture below some soldering of header pins was required, that is then wired to a breadboard which is wired to a Raspberry PI.
</p></div>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_jtag.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd with jtag connected"></p><div><p>
Raspberry PI? wtf ? In this case the Raspberry PI was converted into a JTAG debugger using the outstanding software over at <a href="http://openocd.sourceforge.net/">OpenOCD</a>. As "real" JTAG debuggers are quite expensive ranging from $100 - $1000+ making OCD coupled with the PI an excellent low cost alternative. 
</p><p>

At this point you get a small rush as you gain access and poke the device, after which the vastness of having no idea what anything does starts to weigh you down. Then slowly bit by bit, instruction after instruction, string after string you gain some intuition on the memory map, what the code does, how its setup and eventually find something interesting.
</p></div> 

<p>

The first entry point to look for is the classic printf / trace / debug operation which gives you insight into what the software is doing. And eventually managed to track down the code that`s basically

<code>
void trace(char* Message, ...)
{ 
	va_arg list;
	va_start(arglist, Message);

	char buf[1024];
	vsprintf(buf, Message, arglist);

	if (debug_enable)
	{
		fwrite(output, buf, strlen(buf));
	}
}
</code>

which writes out a string to a console to tell the developer on whats going on. Note that the code has to "flatten" the string first before even deciding to output or not, which gives us a nice window to sniff the string with JTAG even if nothing is written to the console. 
</p>


<p>
After sniffing strings for a while and getting a better feel for whats happening noticed that the SSD is receiving commands from the SATA host no problem. But there`s some sort of funkyness going on that causes the SSD to send no response back - kind of a one-way-street. One idea to resolve this is: in theory the security erase operation restores everything back to good health. The question tho, is the device actually processing a security erase request ?  
</p>


<p>
... and using our printf JTAG sniffer... it most certainly is processing the request! But failing miserably due to an incorrect password. You can see the sniffed printf jtag string in the output below. Hint: <i>"&lt;SED&gt; Credential Comparison Failed"</i> ASCIIZ string.
</p>


	<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_fail.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase fail"></p><p>
Which makes it clear why the security erase / factory reset failed but more importantly you can track down the offending bit of code from this string. That results in the following snippet of assembler courtesy of the IDA toolset below.
</p> 

<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_check.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password check"></p><p>
To decode that for you its doing a 32 byte long compare against some expected cryptographic hash key. Then the <i>"magic compare"</i> aka instruction <b>CMP R5, #1</b> is testing if the keys matched. Then doing a conditional jump to a printf routine based on that comparison result <b>BLNE sub_80...</b>. And finally  the functions return value is the result of the comparison <b>MOV R0, R5</b>. Nothing particularly fancy going on.
</p> 


<p>
There`s a few ways to go from here. One would be to reverse engineer how the 32B key is generated and create  a general purpose exploit. The other would be to just patch the binary such that it thinks it passed the security check. eg Fake a correct password response. We chose the latter as it only takes a few minutes and all I want is to restore the SSD farm`s health. Patching the binary with JTAG is trivial, console output is shown below.
</p> 


<p><img width="1024px" src="https://fmad.io/images/blog/20141229_ssd_security_erase_patch.jpg" alt="fmadio ssd security erase password fake"></p><div><p>
The above shows disassembling the patched code first, the "before" section. This is to check we overwrite the correct bit of code. Then patch it using the command <b>cpu0 arm mww</b> with the value 0xe3a05001. Then disassemble again "after section" to confirm the patch worked and has the correct instruction. 
</p><p>

In this case we replaced <b>BLNE</b> instruction (print error message to the console) with <b>MOV r5, #1</b> at address 0x8009abe4 (shown in blue). The result of the "magic check" is 0 for fail, 1 for pass and write it to register r5. All we did is ignore the whole comparison and simply override it and say the security check always passes (r5 = 1).
</p></div> 

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Now its patched, with cpu`s resumed its the moment of truth. Issuing the security erase operation from the host system via hdparm. 
<br>
<code>
$ sudo hdparm --security-erase 1234  /dev/sdb
security_password="1234"

/dev/sdb:
 Issuing SECURITY_ERASE command, password="1234, user=user
$
</code>
<br>
... and it worked! the SSD is back to life, working as normal and running at high speed!  ... with <b>several thousand dollars worth of SSD`s back in business</b> making our 10G, 40G, 100G network capture systems more resilient than ever. Now if the SSD vendor (who shall remain nameless) would fix the dam bug so excessive back-to-back security password/erase does NOT brick the device, life would be so much better.

      <p>Welcome to <em>Exploring FPGA Graphics</em>. In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models. I’ll be writing and revising this series throughout 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>In this first post, we learn how computer displays work and animate simple shapes with an FPGA.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<p>For this series, you need an FPGA board with video output. We’ll be working at 640x480, so pretty much any video output will work. It helps to be comfortable with programming your FPGA board and reasonably familiar with Verilog.</p>
<p>We’ll be demoing the designs with two boards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://docs.icebreaker-fpga.org/hardware/icebreaker/">iCEBreaker</a></strong> (Lattice iCE40) with <strong><a href="https://docs.icebreaker-fpga.org/hardware/pmod/dvi/">12-Bit DVI Pmod</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/reference-manual">Digilent Arty A7-35T</a></strong> (Xilinx Artix-7) with <strong><a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodvga/reference-manual">Pmod VGA</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="source">Source</h3>
<p>The SystemVerilog designs featured in this series are available from the <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/">projf-explore</a> repo on GitHub. The designs are open source hardware under the permissive MIT licence, but this blog is subject to normal copyright restrictions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Quick Aside: SystemVerilog?!</strong><br>
We’ll be using a few choice features from SystemVerilog to make Verilog a little more pleasant (no laughing at the back). If you’re familiar with Verilog, you’ll have no trouble.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="space-and-time">Space and Time</h2>
<p>The screen you’re looking at is a little universe with its own rules of space and time.</p>
<p>Looking at a screen from afar, you see a smooth two-dimensional image. Look more closely, and you see many individual blocks: these are <strong>pixels</strong>, made up of red, green, and blue components. A typical high-definition image is 1920 pixels across and 1080 lines down: over 2 million pixels in total. Even a 640x480 image has over 300,000 pixels. The need to handle so much information so quickly is a big part of the challenge of working with graphics at a hardware level.</p>
<p>A VGA cable has five main signals: red, green, blue, horizontal sync, and vertical sync. There are no addressing signals to tell the screen where to draw pixels; the secret is time, defined by the sync signals. The red, green, and blue wires carry the colour of each pixel in turn. Each pixel lasts a fixed length of time; when the display receives a <strong>horizontal sync</strong>, it starts a new line; when it receives a <strong>vertical sync</strong>, it begins a new frame. Showing many frames in quick succession provides the illusion of a moving image.</p>
<p>The sync signals are part of <strong>blanking</strong> intervals. Originally designed to allow an electron gun to move to the next line or top of the screen, blanking intervals have been retained and repurposed in contemporary displays: HDMI uses them to transmit audio. The blanking interval has three parts: <strong>front porch</strong>, <strong>sync</strong>, and <strong>back porch</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://projectf.io/img/posts/fpga-graphics/display-timings.png" alt="Display Timings" title="Display Timings"></p>
<h2 id="display-timings">Display Timings</h2>
<p>In this series, we’re going to use <strong>640x480</strong> as our display resolution. Almost all displays support 640x480, and its low resource requirements make it simple to work with on small FPGAs. All the same principles apply at higher resolutions, such as 1280x720 or 4K.</p>
<p>We’ll use traditional horizontal and vertical timings, based on the original VGA monitor and adapter:</p>

</code></pre></div><p><em>Learn more from <a href="https://projectf.io/posts/video-timings-vga-720p-1080p/">Video Timings: VGA, SVGA, 720p, 1080p</a>.</em></p>
<p>Taking blanking into account, we have a total of 800x525 pixels. A typical LCD refreshes 60 times a second, so the number of pixels per second is <code>800 x 525 x 60 = 25,200,000</code>, which equates to a <strong>pixel clock</strong> of 25.2 MHz.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CAUTION: CRT Monitors</strong><br>
Any modern display, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisync_monitor">multisync CRTs</a>, should be fine with a 25.2 or 25 MHz pixel clock. Fixed-frequency CRTs, such as the original IBM 85xx series, could be damaged by an out-of-spec signal. Use these designs at your own risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="running-to-time">Running to Time</h2>
<p>We’ve decided we need a pixel clock of 25.2 MHz pixel clock, but neither of our demo boards has such a clock. To reach the required frequency, we’re going to use a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop">phase-locked loop</a></strong> (PLL). Almost all FPGAs include one or more PLLs, but there isn’t a standard way to configure them in Verilog, so we have to use vendor-specific designs.</p>
<p>We have provided implementations for Xilinx 7 Series (XC7) and Lattice iCE40; for other FPGAs, you’ll need to consult your vendor documentation. If you can’t reach 25.2 MHz exactly, then 25 MHz or thereabouts should be fine (but see note about CRTs, above). The iCE40 can’t generate 25.2 MHz using the oscillators on iCEBreaker but works fine at 25.125 MHz.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="display-timings-module">Display Timings Module</h2>
<p>Using our ~25 MHz pixel clock, we can generate timings for our 640x480 display. Creating display timings is straightforward: there’s one counter for horizontal position and one for vertical. We use these counters to decide on the correct time for sync signals.</p>

</code></pre></div><p><em>ProTip: The last assignment wins in Verilog, so the reset overrides the existing <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code>.</em></p>
<p><strong>sx</strong> and <strong>sy</strong> store the horizontal and vertical position; their maximum values are 800 and 525 respectively, so we need 10 bits to hold them (2<sup>10</sup> = 1024). <strong>de</strong> is <em>data enable</em>, which is low during the blanking interval: we use it to decide when to draw pixels.</p>
<p>Display modes vary in the polarity of their sync signals; for traditional 640x480, the polarity is negative for both <strong>hsync</strong> and <strong>vsync</strong>. Negative polarity means the voltage is mostly high, with low voltage indicating a sync signal.</p>
<p>The following simulation shows the vertical sync starting at the 490th line (counting starts at zero):</p>

<h2 id="test-benches">Test Benches</h2>
<p>You can exercise the designs with the included test benches (Xilinx only):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/common/xc7/clock_gen_tb.sv">Clock Gen Test Bench</a></strong> (Xilinx 7 Series)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/common/xc7/display_timings_tb.sv">Display Timings Test Bench</a></strong> (Xilinx 7 Series)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some things to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the pixel clock period?</li>
<li>How long does the pixel clock take to lock?</li>
<li>Does a frame last exactly 1/60th of a second?</li>
<li>How much time does a single line last?</li>
<li>What is the maximum values of <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code> when <code>de</code> is low?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You can find instructions for running the simulation in the source <a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/tree/master/fpga-graphics">README</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="top-display">Top Display</h2>
<p>Now we have our display signals we’re ready to start drawing. To begin, we’re going to keep it simple and draw a coloured square. When the screen x and y coordinates are both less than 32 we draw in orange; otherwise, we use blue. Because our colour output has 4 bits per channel, we can use a single hex digit from 0-F to represent the intensity of red, green, and blue.</p>
<p>There are two versions of this top module, one for each demo board:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xilinx XC7: <strong><a href="https://github.com/projf/projf-explore/blob/master/fpga-graphics/xc7/top_square.sv">xc7/top_square.sv</a></strong></li>

    </header>

    <p>On this week's episode Steph and Chris discuss some of characteristics and behaviors they've observed in high-performing teams, touching on pull request sizing and prioritizing code review, deploy cadence, error monitoring and response, and minimizing the number of themes being tackled by the team in parallel.  They also touch on moving to Netlify and simplifying deploys, an odd edge case with 303 vs 302 status code, and the quirks of the ActiveRecord <code>or</code> method.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>In 2021 I want to consolidate and improve upon some skills I already have, rather than add more. Here’s what I mean, and how I got inspired.</em></p>

<p>In October last year Samir Talwar <a href="https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar/status/1318904227935227905">tweeted</a> something simple yet profound: “<em>Do less, and do it better</em>”.</p>

<p>In my work and play I discover and start using various tools and technologies. The pace of change in this industry, coupled with the (not unpleasant) demands on what I have to produce, means that I often end up with only a shallow understanding of things. And sometimes these are things I use every day.</p>

<p>The nature of my job as a developer advocate (but I think this extends to development in general), in the context of that fast pace of change, means that there’s always something new to learn, to adopt, and to incorporate into a workflow, process or solution. But that can come at a price - of limited comprehension and mastery.</p>

<p>To explain further, I’m going to stretch a metaphor relating to ploughing a field and sowing seeds.</p>

<p><strong>Ploughing and sowing</strong></p>

<p>As an individual, I sometimes feel as though I’m trying to prepare a large field and plant seeds there using a poorly hand-constructed and inefficient plough made of the wrong sort of wood and bits of string, combined with a seed drill made out of old toilet rolls and sticky tape. Not only that, but I’m trying to plant across the entire field, 50 furrows wide, as I move along.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the ploughing doesn’t go very well, and the seeds are planted imprecisely, sometimes superficially, mostly wastefully, resulting in poor distribution, low growth and high energy expenditure.</p>

<p>But if I were to abandon the idea of going wide, and instead go narrow, focusing on just a handful of furrows, I could afford to take the time to correctly plant each seed, nurturing &amp; watering each one, producing strong plants with deep roots and healthy growth.</p>

<p>I’ve thought this for a while but never got round to doing anything about it. Samir’s tweet has galvanised me into spending some time working out what that means for me.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidating</strong></p>

<p>So this year I’m attempting to “do less, and do it better” by acknowledging the tools I use day in day out, and learn more about them, restricting myself to a narrow set of topics, move a step closer towards mastery in each, and really benefit from everything they have to offer.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from this weekend; I read the entirety of the main README for the excellent fuzzy-finder tool <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, all 16 pages. That might seem ridiculous to say (16 pages is not a lot) but I’ve used <code>fzf</code> for a year or so and never RTFM’d before. In my defence, I’ve also been constantly and painfully aware that I’ve merely scratched the surface. I’ve now discovered some <code>fzf</code> gems that I can put into practice immediately, and some areas that I need to dig into more.</p>

<p>Likewise for other tools that I use, tools that are not only essential, but which, when mastered, can make my workflows even better. I’m thinking of Vim (I’ve recently started watching my friend and colleague David Kunz’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFU7a7OMYfcpjtIpu2j47_Q">DevOnDuty</a> series, which I can strongly recommend), <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki"><code>tmux</code></a> (<a href="http://rwxrob.live/">rwxrob</a> is a great practitioner, and I should re-read Brian P. Hogan’s great <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/bhtmux2/tmux-2/">book on tmux</a> too) and of course the environment and language that ties it all together for me - <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>.</p>

<p>The lockdown has afforded me time to read more, and I need to embrace that and work out how I can keep that momentum up. I want to tip the balance over from always having my fingers on the keyboard towards stepping away from the keyboard to read, reflect and consolidate my learning.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update 02 Feb 2021: I’ve started digging deeper into <code>fzf</code> - see <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/02/fzf-the-basics-1-layout/">fzf - the basics part 1 - layout</a> over on my <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/">Autodidactics</a> blog.</p>

It should be changed soon. Either be less biased about short writing, or make the length criteria less important.</p><p>Because many of us need the right information, not long content.</p><p>Let’s start with the 2 main target users who search for things.</p><p>The first target enjoys reading. It’s like enjoy a video game, a movie, or a song. They enjoy a good experience, a type of content that opens their imagination. Then sail them through any details the author intended. Those types of content use descriptive paragraphs, transitions, with fancy words. It makes readers feel great.</p><p>The second target is in need to search for a piece of information. They prefer a straightforward and simple answer. Which means minimal, concise sentences, with no fancy words.</p><p>I used to enjoy and have no problem reading long content. But recently, I'd spend 5 seconds scanning relevant headings. Then another minute to find the information, or go back and look for another search result.</p><p>To me, this is a horrible reading habit. I realized my attention span getting shorter.</p><p>As our reading habits changed. We need a better format to diggest information. For example, video content is getting more popular. It required less effort to diggest.</p><p>3 common examples are:</p><ul><li>Medium (a blogging platform) rolled out a new model for short content. They found [2] that readers spend more time on good and short content</li><li>Seth Godin, well-known for finding out what's next for marketing. <a href="https://seths.blog/">His daily posts</a> are in between <a href="https://i.imgur.com/N28JSX3.png">50 to &gt; 300 words</a>.</li><li>Successful products that provide sumarize service: Blinklist (sumarize books service) or <a href="https://trends.vc/">TrendsVC</a> (a newsletter summarize recent trend in many categories), or <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/i-lazy-to-read">I Lazy To Read</a> (summarize any article into 5-sentences)</li></ul><p>That goes with the search results. When someone needs an answer, it should be minimal, concise, and straightforward. It's easier to generate short content anyway.</p><hr><p>[cover photo] credit <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/SSh9O_-sTzg">Priscilla Du Preez</a></p><p>[1] i.e <a href="https://backlinko.com/search-engine-ranking#:~:text=The%20average%20Google%20first%20page%20result%20contains%201,447%20words">Search engine ranking</a>, or <a href="https://www.sweor.com/seocontentlength#:~:text=The%20average%20content%20length%20for,content%20each%20web%20page%20has">SEO Content Length</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036691193-Calculating-earnings-in-the-Partner-Program#:~:text=we%E2%80%99ve%20found%20that%20readers%20will%20end%20up%20spending%20more%20time%20with%20the%20piece">How will shorter pieces perform in this new model?</a></p></div></div>]]>

              <p><span>S</span>ix months ago, <a href="https://osjobs.net/co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overseas Rabbit Course</a> started using a new pricing model. After applying the new strategy, revenue from each customer has increased by 2000%. According to this data, the new pricing strategy gained great success. Of course, it would be risky by inferring causation of success from numbers. But after such a large increase in revenue, this article will analyze the reasons behind it.</p>

<p>Overseas Rabbit Course is an interview course for programmers including resume review and mock interview services. The previous pricing model is quite straight forward. It started in April 2018, the day Overseas Rabbit went online. our original pricing model charged a uniform price to each customer for the same course. Customers choose the desired course and pay for it, then we apply the related course for them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/OSJobs/osjobs-info@master/assets/imgs/old%20price.png" alt="Old pricing model"></p>
<p>Just like other service platforms, a common problem for this pricing model is to find the best price to achieve profit maximization, so we adjusted the price in a while. Under the premise that the reduction of price would lead to more customers. However, it didn’t work well. Reflecting on the failure, the wide adopted pricing strategy might not be the one most suitable for our service even though it is used everywhere.</p>

<p>Until June 2020, a customer proposed to use 50% of his monthly salary to pay for our course. It reminds me of another programmer course I have seen before. It is also charged in proportion to the salary. I had doubts about this pricing model at that moment for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paying by proportion is much more expensive than a fixed fee. The median salary of Chinese programmers is about 12,000 yuan, and 50% of the salary is almost 10 times more than the original fee. I’m not sure how many customers are willing to pay for it.</li>
<li>Job hunting is a combination of ability and luck. Some customers may take a few months to be successfully recruited. Such uncertainty may cause unstable revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, after we found a customer who is willing to pay by proportion. We made some adjustments to the course content and adopted a dynamic charging strategy. <strong>Nowadays, all of our courses are free to join, and we charge 50% of the customer’s salary only after they have been recruited successfully.</strong> I call this pricing strategy Proportional Pricing Model. I believe someone must have discovered it earlier than me and has named it, such as the programmer course I saw before. (Welcome to leave a comment if you found the source. ) Surprisingly, under the new pricing model, there are more customers than before, and we successfully increased our revenue by 20 times recently.</p>

<p>In the beginning, we thought that customers wanted to improve the skill for interviewing, but we were wrong. What customers really need is getting a job, <strong>and there is a huge difference between them.</strong> Most people will only judge the quality of the course based on the result after completing it. Under the previous price model, customers will balance between the course cost and interview skills obtained with their criterion. But now, the Proportional Pricing Model closely connects the recruitment certainty with our course so customers would balance the course cost with the success of recruitment.</p>

<li>Proportional Pricing Model means the payment varies with the customer income, customers cannot know the actual number they will pay before getting the job which will make them feel less expensive.</li>
<li>Proportional payment is fairer. Higher cost means a higher salary. Customers should expect to pay as much as possible because it means they have a higher salary.</li>
<li>Percentages cannot be directly compared. If setting a fixed fee, such as 6,000 yuan per customer, the customer can directly compare 6,000 yuan with what he/she could purchase, such as books or other courses.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Usually, customers subscribe to the service because of a certain episode, and they will cancel their subscription after watching it (the first-month cancellation rate of streaming media platforms is higher than 40%). Therefore, streaming media platforms need to continuously spend money on producing new content or purchasing copyrights, which would bring a lot of costs.</p>

<p>Some platforms want customers to automatically renew so they try different ways to prevent users from canceling, like bad UI, complicated steps, etc. Moreover, no customer feels they could take advantage of the same price.</p>
<ol>
<li>Customers who watch less (like me) will regret that they have spent too much on subscription fees. I hate monthly subscriptions, even though the monthly subscription price is cheaper than one cup of coffee.</li>
<li>Customers who watch more will not be satisfied as well for the following two reasons: 1) Because there are a huge amount of videos, it’s difficult to measure how many videos you need to watch to get the fee back. 2) Mostly, watching videos is just a kind of entertainment. People may feel guilty if they spend too much time on it every month, and it leads to subscription cancellation.</li>

<p>With Proportional Pricing Model, I propose a new way to fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customers can join streaming media membership for free and they can watch everything from the platform.</li>
<li><strong>The platform will charge the customer only if his/her monthly watching time is top 30% among all customers</strong>. For example, if Youtube has 10 million members, only 3 million customers will be charged every month, 7 million customers can enjoy services for free.</li>

<li>Charging everyone a fixed price is unfair. Just like electricity bills, charging everyone the same price bill will cause controversy. Therefore, members are charged based on how long they watched is more reasonable.</li>
<li>Everyone likes free products. who will cancel them when auto-renew is free.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Go 1.16 will make system calls through libc on OpenBSD</h2>

	<p><small>February  1, 2021</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the unusual things about <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> is that
it started out with the approach of directly making system calls
on Unix, instead of calling the standard C library functions that
correspond to those system calls. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoCLibraryAPIIssues">There are reasonably good reasons
for Go to make direct system calls</a> and this
works well on Linux, but other Unixes are different. The official
API for Illumos and Solaris system calls requires you to use their
C library, and OpenBSD wants you to do this as well for security
reasons (for <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806776/">OpenBSD system call origin verification</a>). Go has used the C library on
Solaris and Illumos for a long time, but through Go 1.15 it made
direct system calls on OpenBSD and so current released versions of
OpenBSD had a special exemption from their system call origin
verification because of it.</p>

<p>The news of the time interval for Go 1.16 is that this is changing. To
quote from the current draft release notes (which are probably soon to
be the official release notes):</p>

<blockquote><p>On the 64-bit x86 and 64-bit ARM architectures on OpenBSD (the
<code>openbsd/amd64</code> and <code>openbsd/arm64</code> ports), system calls are now
made through <code>libc</code>, instead of directly using the <code>SYSCALL/SVC</code>
instruction. This ensures forward-compatibility with future versions
of OpenBSD. In particular, OpenBSD 6.9 onwards will require system
calls to be made through <code>libc</code> for non-static Go binaries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, Go programs that look up host names or do a few other
operations are very likely to not be statically linked. You can force
static linking (and you'll normally get it if you cross-build), but it
has some drawbacks for hostname lookups in some configurations and you
can't do some other operations at all.</p>

<p>At one level everything is okay with this situation. OpenBSD 6.9 will
almost certainly include Go 1.16 in its ports collection, since it will
be the only version of Go that works on it, and from there you can build
Go programs that will run fine on 6.9. At another level, any dynamically
linked Go program you have will need to be rebuilt with Go 1.16 before
you can run it on OpenBSD 6.9. Hopefully you have the source code and
can still build it (in what will be a 'modular by default' world in Go
1.16). This is nothing really new for OpenBSD, which has always made it
clear that they don't promise ABI or even API compatibility; you always
need to be prepared to rebuild your programs for new OpenBSD versions,
and perhaps to update them to more secure APIs.</p>

<p>(Statically linked Go programs built by Go 1.15 or earlier will likely
keep working on OpenBSD 6.9, assuming that there are no other ABI
changes that affect them. But you should probably plan to rebuild them
with Go 1.16 just to be sure. I don't know what the situation will be
if you want to create Go binaries that work across a range of OpenBSD
versions.)</p>

<p>As the release notes say, Go 1.16 will make system calls through libc
for all programs, whether they're dynamically linked or statically
linked. Right now OpenBSD only requires this for dynamically linked
programs (well, will require it), but always calling via libc is simpler
than to maintain two sets of system call code. And someday OpenBSD may
do something more elaborate so that making system calls via libc is
required even for statically linked programs.</p>

<div>

                                <p><span>CloudLinux is proud to announce the release of AlmaLinux Beta. We’ve collected community feedback and built our new beta release around what you would expect from an enterprise-level Linux distribution. AlmaLinux is a completely free 1:1 binary compatible fork of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, inspired by the community and built by the engineers and talent behind CloudLinux. Visit <a href="https://repo.almalinux.org/almalinux/8.3-beta/isos/x86_64/">this link</a></span><span>&nbsp;to download Beta images.</span></p>

<p><span>With the Beta release deployed, we’d like to ask the community to be involved and provide feedback. We aim to build a Linux distribution entirely from community contributions and feedback. During AlmaLinux Beta, we ask for assistance in testing, documentation, support and future direction for the operating system. Together, we can build a Linux distribution that fills the gap left by the now unsupported CentOS distribution.</span></p>
<p><span>The AlmaLinux team set up all the necessary infrastructure to make it convenient for our contributors to provide their input. The public repository on </span><a href="https://github.com/AlmaLinux"><span>Github</span></a><span> is where we will finalize the source code for the system, and any additional documentation will be posted on the </span><a href="https://wiki.almalinux.org/"><span>wiki</span></a><span>. We set up the wiki and repository to make it easy for the community to provide as much information and feedback as possible. The AlmaLinux team will review every comment and request, but we ask that only registered contributors </span><a href="https://bugs.almalinux.org/login_page.php"><span>file bug reports</span></a><span> to filter out spam.</span></p>
<p><span>To facilitate communication and help answer some of the common questions you might already have, we will be hosting a live QA webinar with the AlmaLinux team. </span><span>The webinar will take place on February 10, </span><span>5 PM (UTC) / 9 AM (PST). Among the participants present will be Igor Seletskiy, CEO of CloudLinux, and Alexander Vinogradov, Head of Engineering at AlmaLinux.</span></p>
<p><span>You can sign up for our webinar </span><a href="https://blog.almalinux.org/webinars/almalinux-beta-qa-webinar/"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any questions, comments, feedback or concerns, please feel free to send us your thoughts to </span><a href="https://blog.almalinux.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6008050c0c0f20010c0d010c090e15184e0f1207"><span><span data-cfemail="cba3aea7a7a48baaa7a6aaa7a2a5beb3e5a4b9ac">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></span></a><span> or send them during the webinar on Twitter with the hashtag #AlmaLinuxBeta.</span></p>
<p><span>CloudLinux and the AlmaLinux team would like to thank the community for their input. This is just the beginning for AlmaLinux, and we look forward to continued improvements and updates for the next generation enterprise-level Linux operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your contribution, input, and support throughout launching AlmaLinux! The infrastructure was the first step, now we need your help to make the next one!</span></p>


<p><strong>Release Notes for AlmaLinux 8 beta</strong></p>
<p><span>The release code name: Purple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas%27s_cat">Manul</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>CloudLinux is proud to present the beta version of AlmaLinux. After roughly a month and a half from the announcement, here is a 1:1 RHEL binary compatible replacement for your RHEL-based systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is for the community and by the community, you’re the soul of Linux. Thank you for your interest and suggestions so far, keep them coming.</span></p>
<p><span>Use this version to thoroughly test your workloads and report any unintended features (ie, bugs) you may find, it will help make AlmaLinux better.</span></p>

		<p><span>About the journal</span></p>
<p>Journal of Illusion (JOI) is an open-access journal that aims at gathering resources to promote the study of illusion. JOI defines an illusion as the perception of an object or phenomenon that is considered to be inconsistent with individual’s or group’s prior knowledge, recognition, or belief as to what the object or phenomenon should be in perception, cognition, and/or physics.&nbsp; Therefore, JOI focuses on perceptual illusions, cognitive illusions (e.g. magic or misunderstanding) or physical illusions (e.g. mirage or the Doppler effect). For perceptual illusions, not only visual illusions but also illusions at various sensory modalities are welcome. Trompe l’oeil as well as illusion artworks are also welcome. <strong><a href="https://journals.openacademia.net/index.php/joi/about">Learn more &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p>

The point is that YouTube video hosting users have noticed the following, to put it mildly, oddity. When trying to upload video content with the Russian anthem to their channels, bloggers were faced with warnings that this allegedly violates the copyrights of some American copyright holders. </p><p>Blogger Yuri Khovansky tried to figure out the situation when he was faced with a warning from the video hosting about “controversial content”.</p><p>It turned out that the music of the Russian anthem, written in Soviet times by the composer Alexander Alexandrov, was somehow "privatized" by the American corporation BMI. Bloggers note that now, in order to use the video with the anthem of Russia on your YouTube channel, you must submit an application to the "copyright holder". Phantasmagoria…</p><p>A detailed study of the situation revealed that this is not only the case with the Russian anthem on YouTube. It turned out that a few months ago this video hosting showed a tendency in which Western companies, including those in the music business, submitted data on the "ownership" of a number of Soviet songs, marches, etc. Thus, the American company The Orchard Music "registered rights "to the Soviet musical compositions" Victory Day "and" Holy War ". This was followed by a whole ninth wave of American "privatization" of Soviet cultural heritage on YouTube. The "rights" of American companies were registered in respect of those songs of Soviet performers who had the largest number of streams on the Internet.</p><p>Thus, it should be stated that American video hosting is actually trying to legitimize outright digital raiding or even piracy, while also encouraging it. This is another example of how far the American digital giants have gone, considering themselves the right to dispose of not only user accounts, but also cultural<a href="https://en.topwar.ru/history/" title="история">historical</a> heritage, to which they themselves have nothing to do.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="penci-post-entry-inner"><p>I recently read through a Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25346851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thread</a> discussing the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> “Kafka Is Not A Database”, by <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>. The opinions behind this topic are fascinating and I enjoyed sifting through comments from both sides of the table. For the purposes of this post, I’ve labeled these two broad groups of thoughts as Team Blue and Team Red.</p><p>Team Blue believes that <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kafka</a>, a popular streaming platform, has the potential to be the source-of-truth for your data—replacing one of the key responsibilities of conventional databases.</p><p>Team Red strongly disagrees.</p><p>The following is high-level summary of these opinions.</p> <h2><strong>Kafka As A Database</strong></h2><h3>TL;DR Streams,Events,Kafka</h3><p>First, a conceptual model of streams:</p><blockquote><p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>, a&nbsp;<strong>stream</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence">sequence</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_element">data elements</a>&nbsp;made available over time.&nbsp;A stream can be thought of as items on a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt">conveyor belt</a>&nbsp;being processed one at a time rather than in large batches.</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Imagine that you’ve hired an invisible assistant. This assistant’s only responsibility is to record everything you do:</p><ol><li>Wakes up @ 8 am</li><li>Brushes teeth @ 8:35 am</li><li>Begins showering @ 8:40 am</li><li>…</li></ol><p>As you go about your day, your assistant meticulously captures your activity and adds new entries into your daily log. This growing log represents a <strong>stream </strong>of your day-to-day activity. The data elements that comprise the stream are known as <strong>events</strong>. Once an event is recorded, it is immutable; the fact that you brushed your teeth at 8:35 am yesterday will never change.</p><p>While your invisible assistant is following you around and <strong>producing</strong> new events to your stream, who is <strong>consuming</strong> them? Anyone who cares! I’m sure your mom would be thrilled to process through your activities and call you if there are any anomalies.</p><p>What about <strong>Kafka</strong>?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">open-source</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stream-processing</a>&nbsp;software platform developed by the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Software Foundation</a>, written in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scala</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java</a>.&nbsp;</p><cite>Wikipedia.org</cite></blockquote><p>Kafka is a platform (large set of software tools) that helps programmers work with streams.</p><h2>Team Blue – Streams Everywhere</h2><p>Team Blue believes that streams are a natural model for both life and computing. Your users produce a stream of clicks, sign-ups, and orders. Your code produces a stream of logs, metrics, and programmatic events. Team Blue believes that the intuitive nature of streams can lead to intuitive software architectures.</p><p>An essential component of any system is the database—a convenient place to read and write whatever you want. How can a stream replace this concept that we are so used to? If streams are a never-ending series of immutable events, then the property of state is the culmination of events up to a certain point in time. For example, the latest state of a database is the culmination of all operations made to that database. In computing, this is referred to as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Event Sourcing</a>. This paradigm is very different to how many developers are used to thinking about their data.</p><p>Beyond data storage, Team Blue is bullish on the idea of stream-focused architectures in general. Streams work well with microservices, promote loose coupling of systems, and have the potential to create leverage in your software. If you’re thinking about streams, you will inevitably think about Kafka—one of the industry’s leading streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Can</strong> you use Kafka as a database? Team Blue says yes.</p><p><strong>Should</strong> you use Kafka as a database? That’s up to you.</p><h2>Team Red – You Need Databases</h2><p>On the other side of the table is Team Red who believes that programmers are making a mistake by replacing conventional databases with Kafka.</p><p>Team Red believes that 99% of applications need the features of a conventional database—especially the features handling complex concurrency issues. Many of us use these features and they are critical for the success of our applications. Modern databases are battle-tested and have been iterated on for decades. Team Red believes that the message of “Kafka As A Database” is a dangerous message that leads developers into architectures they’re not equipped to handle.</p><h2>The People On Each Team</h2><p>There is no shortage of influential people who align with Team Blue. One notable engineer is <a href="https://twitter.com/jaykreps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jay Kreps</a>, CEO of <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Confluent</a>. Confluent is an organization that sells Kafka as a solution to enterprises. There is a direct correlation between using streams and using Kafka; I’m sure Jay has a few extra reasons to be bullish on streams beyond his personal software architecture preferences.</p><p>Another influencer aligned with Team Blue is <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Kleppmann</a>, author of the extremely popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a>. Martin Kleppmann is a researcher who loves the idea of streams. His goal is to educate as many programmers as possible. Martin’s only qualm with Team Red’s opinion is the tone of their blog post. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/martinkl/status/1336336852890963977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Nice blog post [Kafka Is Not A Database] explaining why the “database inside out” approach is not for everyone. <a href="https://twitter.com/narayanarjun">@narayanarjun</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frasergeorgew">@frasergeorgew</a> are right —&nbsp;if you need to maintain constraints before events are written (e.g. not selling more items than you have in stock), it’s easier to use a DB and CDC.</p><p>On the other hand, the message is also a bit patronising. It basically says “you’re not clever enough to use an event log correctly — leave database stuff to the experts”. I respectfully disagree: it is good to explore new approaches. Learn about the trade-offs, educate yourself.</p><cite>Martin Kleppmann</cite></blockquote><p>Engineers on Team Red’s side include <a href="https://materialize.com/author/arjun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arjun Narayan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://materialize.com/author/george-fraser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">George Fraser</a>, co-authors of the <a href="https://materialize.com/kafka-is-not-a-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> which refutes the idea of “Kafka As A Database.” They have decided to put a large, yellow caution sign in front of Team Blue’s message. Team Red has no issue with Kafka or streams; they have an issue with eager developers throwing out their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDMSs</a> and jumping on the stream bandwagon. Their only extra agenda might be to get extra eyeballs on their engineering blogs.</p><h2>Arguments From Team Blue</h2><p>The following points are summaries of topics discussed in Martin Kleppmann’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0&amp;t=2089s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a>.</p><h3>High Integrity Data – Never Deleted</h3><p>With a database, your information is easily susceptible to being lost. Once your Postgres row is updated, it’s difficult to recover the previous state of that row without introducing custom accountability software. Databases and the records inside them are designed to be mutable. It’s both a great convenience and a great risk. If a table accidentally gets deleted, you might find yourself scrambling to restore your database from a backup. This is particularly painful in production.</p><p>On the other hand, if your data exists as a log of immutable events—and that log happens to be retained forever—the history of your changes never runs the risk of being erased. Accounting is a great example of this—accountants balance their books by only appending new entries to their ledgers. An error in a financial transaction is always fixed by another transaction.</p><p>Team Blue believes that this characteristic can be an asset to software architectures. As a permanent log of events, data will always have its historical context and can easily be audited. Furthermore, the lack of an “eraser” forces programmers and processes to be held highly accountable for their actions.</p><div> <p><span>Trade-Off</span>: </p><p> One concern of storing all your data in a log is that the size of your logs may become unwieldy over time. Do we really care about how a customer changed their email 3 years ago or do we only care about what it is today? Large Kafka logs can also complicate consumers—catching up from offset 0 may not be so easy. Kafka has implemented features like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Log Compaction </a> to mitigate this. However, this is yet another complexity for programmers to manage and debug. </p><p> Another trade-off of this architecture is that it can become cumbersome for privacy concerns. There are administrative use-cases (GDPR) when you are required to completely <strong>hard delete</strong> all of your customer’s personal information from your system. This takes additional effort if the data to be deleted is scattered across logs and storage systems.</p></div><h3>Separation Of Concerns – Reading / Writing</h3><p>Team Blue points out that one of the great conveniences of databases is also one of its greatest challenges. The convenience of databases is undeniable—an easy one-stop shop to read and write anything. The drawback to being a one-stop shop is that you can’t be the best at any <strong>one</strong> thing, which becomes problematic as you scale.</p><p>Conventional databases easy conflate reads and writes, two very different styles of operations. As you scale, the access patterns in your software will inevitably force you to optimize for a certain set of operations. If an operation-specific optimization is done in a centralized location, it will likely degrade the performance of other operations in that location. If you optimize reads, you complicate writes—and vice versa.</p><p>One of the first steps in optimizing SQL reads is to begin denormalizing (duplicating) data across various tables. Once your data is duplicated, queries require less joins and respond faster. However, the drawback of denormalization is that it creates additional complications on the write pathway. Programmers need to remember to update and synchronize the duplicated data across multiple tables.</p><p>This pattern grows in complexity as you scale. If denormalization isn’t getting you the required read performance, the usual next step is to introduce a cache in front of your database. A cache is extremely convenient and can be designed to precisely answer the questions your clients are asking. However, as many programmers are intimately aware of, maintaining a cache is never easy. You now to need synchronize writes across network boundaries, worry about distributed transactions, and debug subtle invalidation issues.</p><p>Going back to our make-believe example, my assistant only has <strong>one</strong> responsibility—log my daily activity. One day, I decide that I want to look back in time to see how my activities are categorized. Unfortunately, I can’t ask my assistant this question because it’s too specific; all he knows how to do is produce events. To get insights on my activity, …</p></div></div></div>

February 1, 2021 | https://otherlife.co/barbarians-past-the-gate/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://otherlife.co/barbarians-past-the-gate/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="div_block-73-2180"><div id="inner_content-74-2180"><section id="section-2-306"><div><div id="inner_content-3-306"><p>Legacy institutions are at war with distributed collective intelligence, but the legacy institutions are losing—badly.</p>
<p>2 million full-time “content creators,” outside any professional sanction; the election of Donald Trump against an airtight media consensus certain of its impossibility; mass, hysterical preference falsification due to a normalization of political correctness, with silent mass migration into countless private communities; Big Tech’s capitulation to censorship on all major social platforms; the resilient rise in the price of Bitcoin and a proliferation of <a href="https://forefront.market/ranking">durable social currencies on Ethereum;</a> and most recently, an unprecedented execution of decentralized social intelligence, which minted more than a few millionaires out of thin air, by <a href="https://share.transistor.fm/s/05408a92">a niche internet community hacking the source code of finance capitalism.</a></p>
<p>Most of the essential requirements for a functioning polity—fiat currency, leaders, laws, and shared identity—have been fully decoded and open-sourced in the form of cryptocurrencies, content creators, Smart Contracts, and fandoms. It seems inevitable that our roughly 195 nation states must increasingly give way to thousands of digital micro-polities, as these embryonically political structures grow in economic and psychological power.</p>
<p>The only other defining characteristic of autonomous polities—a monopoly on the use of force—is increasingly obsolete as the payoff to peaceful trade raises the opportunity cost of physical violence. Hence the relative dearth of interstate war since the end of World War II.</p>
<p>If you doubt the claim that “content creators” are budding politicians—whether they know it or not—consider the curious case of Mr. Beast.</p>
<p>The most powerful Youtubers are accidentally rediscovering the nature of Aristocracy, a type of social role we like to think we abolished.</p>
<p>Mr. Beast is a Youtuber who currently enjoys 52 million subscribers and earns somewhere in the ballpark of $20-30 million annually at the age of 22. Jimmy Donaldson built one of the most influential and economically successful Youtube channels through a specific concept: Outrageous and conspicuous acts of generosity. His typical video involves him gifting large sums of money or lavish objects to random people, poor people, or friends.</p>
<p>As true aristocrats have always known, and as contemporary elites have forgotten, lavish generosity towards the needy demonstrates one’s authentic nobility, wins public attention and admiration, and genuinely improves society while increasing the political and economic power of the donor.</p>
<p>The so-called “creator economy” is only a becoming-liquid of the circuit connecting noble traits, admiration, and capital, such that the previously abolished form of Aristocracy re-appears in a distributed and ungovernable format. You could try to govern it, but you would need someone as organically admirable as the target, or else Mr. Beast fans will never even hear about your new law, let alone respect it (especially after they upload themselves full-time to the Mr. Beast VR pod and earn all of their income through Mr. Beast’s branded gaming engine). National law enforcement does not generally excel in the domain of authentic nobility, ergo the new form of distributed Aristocracy will not be put back in the bottle.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting Mr. Beast will become the effective President of a new country within the United States. I am suggesting Mr. Beast will be one of <em>thousands</em> who effectively constitute micro-polities, each one optimizing for different personality types and demographic buckets. Power laws dictate a small minority of creators will enjoy audiences far larger than the rest, but I suspect at least several thousands of creators will operate all-inclusive <em>weltanschauungen</em> for audiences of several thousands. I am pulling these specific numbers out of thin air, but I am directionally confident; I would encourage someone to explore more sophisticated modeling of this question.</p>
<p>If you still doubt that someone like Mr. Beast is an embryonic statesman, you might be impressed to learn about his long-term goal. His stated goal is to create a nation-wide system of homeless shelters and food banks. That’s right, he’s going to build a <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/11/19/mrbeast-philanthropy-food-bank/">national system of public housing.</a> I see no reason why he cannot succeed, given that he has already proven a business model that turns charismatic philanthropy into attention, admiration, and wealth for himself. Given that the USA Department of Housing and Urban Development doesn’t even try to create housing any more, it is not particularly speculative or sci-fi to suggest that Mr. Beast is on his way to becoming a kind of shadow Secretary of Housing in the United States. It’s there for the taking, it’s his stated goal, and he’s on track to do it. If he falters, it’s hard to imagine that the next generation of creators will also fail to appreciate such historic opportunities in front of them.</p>
<p>Bitcoin feeds directly into content creators becoming governors, not additively but multiplicatively—in a few ways. This means you should watch out for non-linear takeoffs, where things seem to be unfolding gradually, gradually… and then all at once.</p>
<p>First of all, Bitcoin is becoming the leading inflation-hedge asset as the US government engages in unprecedented money printing. Censorship-resistant and inflation-proof money is becoming increasingly accessible, normalized, and trusted at the same time that legacy institutions are doubling down on… censorship and inflation. It’s not inconceivable that eventually the US government needs Bitcoin—and the intellectual/communication services of leading content creators—much more than anyone needs the US government. If the US government’s balance sheet gets worse, and Bitcoin continues to get better, this alone could trigger a non-linear event where all smart money rushes into Bitcoin rapidly, and the US government’s balance sheet collapses with equal rapidity.</p>
<p>Second, most of the leading content creators have hardly even begun utilizing cryptocurrency. They will. Given the mimetic nature of financial value, leading Youtubers could single-handedly increase the price of any given cryptocurrency, simply by promoting it, using it, and whipping their fans into a frenzy.</p>
<p>Just recently Elon Musk put the word “Bitcoin” in his Twitter profile and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/elon-musk-prompted-bitcoin-price-surge-causes-liquidation-of-387m-in-shorts">the price of Bitcoin immediately rose 15%.</a> If for any reason Bitcoin becomes fashionable among leading creators, the result will be non-linear. The creators would be making themselves even richer, simply by adopting Bitcoin and triggering price increases, so I consider this to be a game-theoretic inevitability (even if many don’t want to take this opportunity at time t1, rising creators who do take this opportunity at time t2 will dominate the others, which means it is hard to imagine a future in which this opportunity is not taken).</p>
<p>Just as we watched the Reddit community Wallstreetbets pump the price of Gamestop on the stock exchange, without a leader, any community with a leader will be all the more capable of such a feat. The Robinhood app was able to halt purchases of Gamestop, but there already exist decentralized crypto exchanges, on which nobody has the power to halt trades. Technically unstoppable versions of the Gamestop pump therefore seem inevitable on decentralized exchanges, meaning communities will eventually have unprecedented power to affect the value of assets by sheer belief and collective will.</p>
<p>There is already a new breed of avant-garde content creators—small compared to Mr. Beast but large enough to be dangerous—investing heavily in crypto assets and infrastructure. Consider Trevor McFedries, creator of the first CGI influencer Lil’ Miquela. He’s minted his own social currency $FWB on the Ethereum blockchain, and its value has been <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/friends-with-benefits">rising steadily</a> as the value of his community increases. If he and his community continue to create value inside the community, the value of $FW will continue to rise, and everyone in the community will see their wealth increase in proportion to their $FWB holdings. It is hard to imagine that there will not eventually be a creator as big as Mr. Beast and as crypto-savvy as McFedries, who runs a private digital community with a market cap as great as the GDP of many countries.</p>
<p>The most influential content creators will build cabinets of advisors and shareholders drawn from different domains: A chief technologist drawn from Silicon Valley, a chief financial officer drawn from Wall Street, etc. This is when the political nature of content creators will become unmistakable. These companies will look and feel like small national governments, running a combination of revenue-generating enterprises for profit and philanthropic enterprises for citizen-recruitment, all organized around their own state-sponsored media.</p>
<p>The nation state may well persist, but only as a shell of its former self, and mainly by hitching its wagon to the leading micro-polities. One can imagine a scenario in which Heads of State and leading content creators broker an informal bargain that allow Heads of State to save face on condition they defer to the new power-holders. In the near future, the relationship of the US President and leading American Youtubers may be analogous to the relationship between the Queen of England and Parliament.</p>
<p>Many micro-polities will initially appear to mainstream observers as religious “cults,” driven by “conspiracy theories,” led by charismatic “grifters,” operating massive “pyramid schemes.” Eventually it will be realized that such things have always been the building blocks of nations. As the myth of Romulus attests, the founding of a nation is always a crime—until it’s the law.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in 2015, I discovered a surprising security vulnerability that allowed you to run malicious JavaScript code on the Google search engine results page, which might be one of the most secure pages on the internet given how much daily traffic it recieves. It wasn’t until <a href="#the-fix">4 years later (or 2019) that they finally closed the case on it</a> and I could share it without breaking my nondisclosure agreement with Google.</p><p>This sounds like a lot like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS attack</a>, which you would imagine Google would sanitize for, but it’s not and it’ll soon become clear why as I explain.</p><p>I was on Google searching for something like <em>“text-to-speech javascript libraries”</em>. I went from the Google search results page to clicking the first result, back to the Google search results page, to clicking on the second result, back to the Google search results page, etc. What I noticed was that my speakers kept making a clicking noise, like they were turning on and off—but just for a second.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/google-search.png" loading="lazy" width="340"></figure><p>I thought maybe there was some other program running on my computer or that my speakers were busted, but I realized it happened everytime I went to the Google search results page for this query. It also happened everytime I went to the first search results page, which was of a company that had a demo of their text-to-speech solution on it.</p><p>I figured the company’s page was loading their text-to-speech engine, that seemed to use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis">SpeechSynthesis interface of the WebSpeech API</a>, and that’s why the speakers were turning on. But why were they on the Google page? That seemed like Google was maybe pulling in code on the search results page from the company’s page. That should never happen though, surely Google sanitizes anything that ever gets displayed on their pages from containing HTML or <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p><p>This seemed like a plausible attack vector if there was some bug that allowed you to bring arbitrary code on to the Google search results page and a huge one at that.</p><p>I dumped the source code of the search results page and started looking at the HTML around the search result, but it didn’t look like any <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or HTML tags were making it through. I started looking for instances of the company’s domain and found something like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span>=</span><span>"prerender"</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://thecompanyspage.com/example"</span>&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>I was not familiar with <code>rel="prerender"</code> myself in 2015. Indeed, it seemed to be some sort of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-resource-hints-20150717/#dfn-prerender">new mechanism for pre-fetching and pre-loading a page</a> to speed up page transistions and load times as an optimization.</p><p>Google seemed to have invented <code>rel="prerender"</code> to prefetch and load the first search result in the background, so that when you clicked on the first search result (as most users do), it would instantly be ready for viewing.</p><p>The <code>rel="prerender"</code> has to execute JavaScript to load dynamic content, but it wasn’t blocking the WebSpeech API from playing audio possibly. Luckily for Google, the pre-rendered content is loaded in its own origin and, therefore, sensitive resources like cookies on the Google page were not at risk from being harvested by attackers like they would be in an XSS attack.</p><p>After learning this, the next step was to prove this out with my own website on Google’s search results page and see what I could make of it.</p><p>I needed a long obscure phrase that I could get the #1 Google search result spot for and that no one would accidently stumble upon so I could keep the vulnerability relatively secret until Google could fix it. I chose the apt phrase “Alphabet Spoke to Me In My Dreams” and purchased the <code>alphabetspoketomeinmydreams.xyz</code> domain name (now expired) that would show up as the first Google search result for the phrase. This was around the time <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/technology/google-alphabet-restructuring.html">Google restructured into Alphabet Inc</a>.</p><p>The first malicious thing I could think to do was to “vandalize” the Google search results page with one of those “win a prize” scams pretending to be Google to phish their users. I also thought it would be sufficiently creepy to show how you were able to access standard information about the user like their location, ISP, IP address while being prerendered and speak it back to them. I know <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/iZ6bamP8wZk?t=46">Dwight Schrute would be scared of that</a>.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bFlquq0GcY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio on the Google search results page.</figcaption></figure><p>So this looks pretty bad, but you would think that a user might notice if they click on the first result that it was a 3rd-party page causing the audio to play not Google right? Yes, except you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/hidden"><code>document.hidden</code> property</a> to detect prerender mode and condition your code so that it only runs in <code>rel="prerender"</code> mode on the Google search engine results page! This creates a pretty robust appearance for impersonation as nothing happens if you go to the page directly.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>if</span> (<span>document</span>.hidden) {
  <span>// The page is being loaded in rel="prerender", run the WebSpeech API code
</span><span></span>} <span>else</span> {
  <span>// The page is being loaded normally, don't do anything
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><h2 id="chrome-vulnerability">Chrome Vulnerability</h2><p>While testing this, I found that this doesn’t only work on the Google search results page, but it turns out Chrome also “prerenders” the first result of the autocomplete in the URL search bar. Therefore, you can start playing WebSpeech audio without even having a page loaded in the browser frame.</p><figure><div><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pqyOnzGDRlg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><figcaption><span>Google Chrome Proof-of-Concept</span>
JavaScript code executing to play speech synthesis audio in the Chrome browser before any page is loaded in the browser at all when triggered by a user typing in a search into the URL search bar.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="denial-of-service-possibilities">Denial-of-Service Possibilities</h2><p>After testing other APIs, it seemed clear that only the WebSpeech API was making it through to the parent page. Things like <code>alert()</code> boxes were deferred from being visible until the page was actually loaded. But it also seemed clear that, while certain APIs were not available, JavaScript was running unrestricted. What happens if you do an infinite loop on the prerendered page?</p><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>while</span> (<span>true</span>) {
  <span>// Infinite loop
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><p>Yep, you could “denial of service” the Google search results page from being displayed. This is not an attack on their servers, but rather you lock up the user’s browser so Google’s search results page cannot load.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2021/01/dos.png" loading="lazy" alt="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" title="Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service" width="600"><figcaption><span>Google Search Results Page Denial-of-Service</span>
Preventing the Google search results page from even loading by infinite looping in the prerendered page.</figcaption></figure><p>I shared the live example and a locally reproducible example of the vulnerability to Google.</p><h2 id="googles-response">Google’s Response</h2><p>Google’s security team responded promptly and professionally within 24 hours and decided to award a monetary reward for the vulnerability. The Chrome team did not dual-award since Google had already awarded. The Chrome team, however, were responsible for fixing the issue. I was not able to share this bug for quite some time due to the nondisclosure terms of Google’s vulnerability program.</p><h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2><p>The bug report and discussion is now public and visible <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=520275">here</a>.</p><p>I was suprised at how long it took to resolve and how difficult the fix seemed to be. It proved very difficult to break this API out from being enabled in the prerender context. In fact, at one point, one of the developers mentioned: <em>“This is currently our oldest &gt;= Medium severity security bug."</em> It was not until 2019 that they finally closed the bug after prerendering support was completely dropped from Chrome, due to it causing headaches like this, and the proof-of-concept could no longer be reproduced.</p><p>So, it seems premature optimization like <code>rel="prerender"</code> being the root of all evil isn’t just true because you might spend time <a href="https://xkcd.com/1691/">optimizing something that isn’t worth it</a>, but also because it likely increases the complexity and surface area for serious security bugs.</p></div></div>]]>

The formation of this new super-city doubled Berlin’s population from 1.9 million to what was, at the time, a staggering 3.9 million people, making it the world’s fifth-largest city after Tokyo.</p><p>While it is far from unusual to see major world cities expand and contract over time, as well as for the major cities of past eras to be overtaken by the new megacities of Asia, Africa, and South America, it is practically unheard of for a city on the scale of Berlin to be smaller in 2020 than it was 100 years before. The catastrophic destruction of WWII and the Battle of Berlin, which caused the population to plummet back to nearly its pre-Groß-Berlin level, also brought about the conditions that would keep the population low well into the following century. The crushing geopolitical gravity generated by Berlin’s position at the heart of the Cold War acted as a colossal reduction gear, stifling growth in both the Western and Eastern sectors of the city as each side threw all available resources into countering the advances of the other.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_131865"><div>

This cyclical progression informs both the subject matter and the overarching structure of <strong><em>Unfinished Metropolis</em></strong>, a monumental new 2-volume work from Berlin’s Dom Publishers. The book accompanies the exhibition of the same name (“Unvollendete Metropole”; info at end of article), and takes a many-faceted view of Berlin, starting with an examination of the newly-unified Groß-Berlin, a unification that only happened, unsurprisingly (and much like the BER Airport debacle of the 21st century) after decades of conflict and barely-there consensus. As the introduction points out, Greater Berlin has spent the majority of its existence outside of democratic rule:</p><p><em>Greater Berlin was not ruled by democratically elected governments for many years of its history. It was only governed democratically in the period from 1920 to 1933 and then again more recently since 1990. The Greater Berlin project has suffered many setbacks. The city is an incomplete project.</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_145993"><div>

In a remarkable cartoon that compresses the curvature of the earth from Rome through Dresden and Berlin and beyond, reminiscent of Saul Steinberg’s “View of the World from 9th Avenue”, it even cast the Axis of WWII phantasmagorically onto the curvature of the earth. More frequently, though, its perspective zooms <em>in</em> on a staggering array of Berlin neighborhoods and city centers (Berlin’s paradoxical nature as a city with numerous “centers” is a recurring theme in the book), from lasting “centers” like Alexanderplatz and Zoologischer Garten to outlying districts like Friedenau in the West and Marzahn in the East, as well as yet more microscopic examinations of plazas, parks, and even specific artworks.</p></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_154562"><div>

While such a vast array of maps might seem overwhelming, their overall effect is, paradoxically, one of greater focus. The accumulation of so many varied views of the city leads to a surprisingly unified view of the whole, like a cubist painting or a musical composition with a repeating theme. Berlin has spent the past century proving itself to be one of the world’s most unmappable cities (from a conventional perspective), with monumental buildings constructed and razed to the ground within decades – and, in the case of the Stadtschloß, built up again. The city has seen whole neighborhoods built, destroyed, and rebuilt, streets changing names from decade to decade, and of course its 30-year stint as two divided cities.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><h3><em>The accumulation of so many varied views of the city leads to a surprisingly unified view of the whole, like a cubist painting or a musical composition with a repeating theme</em></h3></blockquote><p>True to its cyclical take on Berlin’s history, the book favors a thematic progression over a chronological one, moving backwards and forwards in history, from the 1920s (and even earlier) right up to bleeding-edge current events like COVID-19, the new BER Airport, and the still-under-construction Tesla Gigafactory. While current mayor Michael Müller provides an introductory text, the true “host” of the book is <strong>Gustav Böß</strong>, mayor of Greater Berlin from 1921 to 1929. Böß possesses not only a far-reaching futurism – “Urban development should never be driven by current needs, but rather by how it will meet future needs” – but also a timeless weariness appropriate to anyone who has attempted to obtain a consensus in the cranky, contentious politics of Berlin. His words written in the 1920s resonate prophetically over the next century’s worth of maps, documents, and photographs, and introduce each major new thematic section, from Berlin’s rail network to its roads and streets to the issue of its numerous “centers”.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603726593778_150290"><div>

The competition, as well as Volume Two itself, take an international view of city planning, looking abroad to other European capitals from London to Paris to Moscow.

                  Yes, we highly recommend to continue using adblockers, such as uBlock Origin, uMatrix, or similar. They give you more fine grained control over domains. iE you can allow certain domains to allow css files &amp; images while blocking cookies &amp; javascripts. The Portmaster cannot make this distinction.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For almost 4 years now I have been a web development contractor.</p>
<p>To me, a software contracting job is about bringing in extra resources to help
you or your company solve a problem. Something you can’t solve or it’s too
economically disadvantageous to solve by only relying on your current staff.
Kinda like if you had to add a downpipe to your guttering - you probably will
get it done, but chances are it’s gonna take more time, money, and pain than
if you had instead opted for a handyman to do the job.</p>
<p>Needing a contractor automatically implies a few things. First, you actually
have a concrete problem. This might be rolling out a new feature, fixing some
old bugs, or improving an existing user journey - a project in a sense. Whatever
it is - you know exactly (or nearly) what you want. Second, your engineers can’t
be allocated to the task, they have better things to do. Third, you want to
bring someone on board who knows their shit. You are not interested in investing
in their future or growing an in-house team. You just want to get stuff done.
And finally - you have a budget and a time constraint to work with.</p>
<p>So the question is - How the heck do you know if the person you are interviewing
is going to do a job of acceptable quality, on time, and within budget?</p>
<p>Well, how do you work out if the handyman can do your guttering?</p>
<p>I would instinctively ask them about the work they’ve already done. Have they
worked on guttering before? If yes - what kind? Maybe they’ve worked with
plastic pipes or perhaps they prefer old fashioned copper systems? Hell, if the
convo’s going well, I might ask them to show me some of their previous work! Why
stop there - ask them about how they are going to carry the job out? All good
questions, no doubt, and it seems most people will take a similar approach when
looking for a handyman.</p>
<p>So why is it then, when I apply for a software contracting job in your company,
you are asking me to solve a 2sum problem? Why do you insist I implement a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo">linked list</a>? How is me inverting
a binary tree helping you decide if I can build your GraphQL API? Does it really
help you work out if I’ll be able to fix that mess of a legacy networking
library your ex-principal engineer left behind if I can convert Roman numerals
to Arabic and back?</p>
<p>No, none of this will help you figure it out. Just like it won’t help you work
out if the handyman can fix your guttering if you ask them to demonstrate to you
how to climb a ladder, drive a screw, or fix a light bulb.</p>
<p>If you need to ask these questions at an interview, then you most certainly
don’t need a contractor. You want permanent employees. What you need is to
grow the organisation and have people you can continuously invest in. You don’t
necessarily have an immediate problem requiring you to bring in extra help. It’s
either that or you just heard FAANGs are hiring this way, so I’mma do it too.</p>
<p>I’m not 22 and definitely not fresh out of gradschool. I <a href="https://www.tonkata.com/work/">have been around for a
while</a> and I know my shit. I’ve seen things and I have no
problem showing you my work or walking you through it. I have no illusions of
being a genius or the best and that’s reflected in my day rate. I’m a contractor
with real world experience. Experience from the same world your paying customers
live in - not the imaginary problems and shitty data structures one.</p>
<p>So please don’t waste my time with your pretend problems and ego scratching.
It’s not a contractor you are after.</p>

<![CDATA[The “induced demand“ case against YIMBYism is wrong]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I want to talk about an idea that I don’t think has much purchase in real-world politics but seems to loom large both on the internet and in academic circles — the idea that new real estate development activity actually <em>causes gentrification</em> through some kind of induced demand phenomenon. </p><p>Nathan Robinson in his <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/the-only-thing-worse-than-a-nimby-is-a-yimby">anti-YIMBY screed</a> explores a scenario in which replacing smaller buildings with larger ones increases housing scarcity even while adding units because “we're luring rich people from elsewhere to our city.” He’s doing a thought-experiment, but clearly one he thinks is plausible, while <a href="https://shelterforce.org/2018/11/05/heres-what-we-actually-know-about-market-rate-housing-development-and-displacement/">Amee Chew</a> in a 2018 Shelterforce article states that “numerous studies show that market-rate housing development has price ripple effects on surrounding neighborhoods, driving up rents and increasing the burden on lower-income households.”</p><p>Chew’s studies don’t really say that (more on this later) but the studies do say what I also know from personal experience which is that people living through a gentrification process often <em>say</em> this is what’s going on. This is all exacerbated by the fact that many people, as in this recent Washington Post article about Mt Pleasant, <em>define</em> gentrification as the presence of new-built condos with chain store retail on the ground floor. And it is definitely true that if what you mean by “gentrification” is “new buildings and chain stores” then blocking new buildings and chain stores will block gentrification.</p><p>But the argument here is supposed to be about prices, displacement, and ultimately people’s living standards. </p><p>And the induced demand objection fails on four scores:</p><ul><li><p>It is empirically false, at least most of the time. </p></li><li><p>Accepting its logic would counsel against <em>all</em> efforts to improve quality of life.</p></li><li><p>If it were true, it still wouldn’t follow that new construction is bad.</p></li><li><p>It misconstrues what the YIMBY proposal is in the first place.</p></li></ul><p>As I say, I don’t really believe that people believing in the induced demand argument explains any of the proximate barriers to housing reform. But it does come up a lot online, so I’d like to have a resource for explaining to people what’s wrong with it.</p><h4>The induced demand intuition</h4><p>The WMATA Green Line was extended to Columbia Heights in 1999, which meant that by 2003 a young person such as myself looking for a cheap place to live in a walkable neighborhood with good access to mass transit might pick it blindly off Google Maps and Craigslist as a good place to rent a basement apartment. </p><p>It was actually a fairly dismal neighborhood at the time, largely because the immediate vicinity of the metro station was a bunch of unsightly vacant lots and construction sites. But if you went to the no-longer-extant Columbia Heights Coffee Shop, all the talk among the gentrifiers was “there’s going to be a Target soon.” And, indeed, a few years later the construction sites were transformed into apartment buildings and retail, so if you go today, the immediate environs of the Metro station feature a Giant, a Target, a Best Buy, a Wawa, a Starbucks, and a bunch of other national chains along with some locally owned businesses. Then the slightly less proximate commercial areas either north on 14th Street or over on 11th Street are thriving ecologies of local businesses.     </p><p>There is clearly some kind of flywheel effect whereby the new retail amenities make the neighborhood a better place to live, which attracts more (and more affluent) residents, which in turn makes it a more attractive place to locate your business. </p><p>Now I think it’s obvious that the start of the Columbia Heights flywheel was the opening of the Green Line, especially given the largest context of falling urban crime during this period. The reason you could find white people in a coffee shop talking about how they were looking forward to the Target opening is that the gentrification cycle was already underway. Neighborhoods normally experience an initial hipster phase of gentrification (typified by dive bars, yoga studios, and independent coffee shops) <em>before</em> the major real estate developments and national chains arrive. </p><p>But we can argue intuitions all day — the real question is research.</p><h4>Empirically, more supply lowers prices</h4><p>Back when I wrote <em>The Rent Is Too Damn High</em>, I said that the impact of new development on hyper-local prices was theoretically ambiguous and the important thing was to look at city-wide effects that are not. </p><p>Fortunately, the past few years have seen a good amount of empirical work on this question. And it turns out that in most cases studied, new units reduce prices even on a very local scale. </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oplls6utgf7z6ih/Pennington_JMP.pdf?dl=0">Kate Pennington</a>’s recent study of San Francisco is very precise: “I find that rents fall by 2% for parcels within 100m of new construction. Renters’ risk of being displaced to a lower-income neighborhood falls by 17%. Both effects decay linearly to zero within 1.5km.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/7fc2bf_ee1737c3c9d4468881bf1434814a6f8f.pdf">Xiaodi Li</a> looked at New York: “For every 10% increase in the housing stock, rents decrease 1% and sales prices also decrease within 500 feet.”</p></li><li><p><a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-left-nimby-canon">Brian Asquith, Evan Mast, and Davin Reed</a> look specifically at new market-rate housing in low-income neighborhoods in eleven cities and find: “New buildings decrease nearby rents by 5 to 7 percent relative to locations slightly farther away or developed later, and they increase in-migration from low-income areas.”</p></li></ul><p>There are some more studies along these lines, but I don’t want to inundate you with them because I do agree that the impact is theoretically ambiguous and someday, someone, somewhere will find the opposite result. </p><p>It is striking, though, that induced demand theory doesn’t yet have its Card &amp; Kruger paper that changed the game on the minimum wage. There is no Arin Dube of induced demand theory who’s published a series of rigorous empirical papers demonstrating that there’s something weird in this market. Instead you get this from Chew:</p><blockquote><p>Studies show that market-rate housing development is linked to the mass displacement of neighboring low-income residents (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>). Such displacement occurs even when low-income housing is not directly demolished and destroyed to make way for new development—because it operates through indirect and exclusionary means, such as “price shadowing” (Davidson and Lees&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a3739">2005</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.clarku.edu/mdavidson/files/2012/02/Davidson-Lees-2010-New-Build-Gentrification.pdf">2010</a>). Market-rate housing production causes significant price impacts in surrounding neighborhoods, raising area rents and real estate taxes (Oliva&nbsp;<a href="https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4205/umi-umd-4016.pdf;sequence=1">2006</a>; Pearsall&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/c08126">2010</a>; Zuk and Chapple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">2016</a>).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So I checked the links.</p><p>The two Davidson and Lees papers are concerned with a definitional question in urban geography. According to them, the traditional meaning of gentrification in the literature is something like “rich people move into old homes and renovate them.” They argue that we should extend the definition to include things like new mixed-use housing and retail developments in underused industrial spaces. They <em>assert</em> but do not demonstrate that “price shadowing” occurs in these cases, and then argue that this sort of phenomenon ought to count as gentrification.</p><p><a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/images/udp_research_brief_052316.pdf">Zuk and Chapple</a> actually say: “At the regional level, both market-rate and subsidized housing reduce displacement pressures, but subsidized housing has over double the impact of market-rate units.”</p><p>Pearsall says that cleaning up brownfields raises prices in nearby Census tracts, which is interesting and raises the question of whether “make people live near toxic waste” is really the affordable housing strategy we want. </p><p>Last we get to Oliva, who at last actually finds induced demand. He looks at the Inner Harbor project in Baltimore which transformed a largely derelict stretch of waterfront into a tourist attraction featuring a convention center, an amazing aquarium, a cool park, and a bunch of hotels and restaurants. Note that in this case promoting economic development was the intended goal of the initiative (Baltimore is poor) and the point of his study is that it was a limited success story — home values did rise, but “this impact has been far more pronounced on the prices of properties located within a short distance from the water even decades after the initial projects on the waterfront were started.”</p><p>This is all good empirical work. But note that I don’t think anyone has ever argued that building an aquarium will reduce housing cost burdens. The Inner Harbor is (by design) a tourist attraction. A couple of weeks ago, I took my kid to the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, then we drove down to the Inner Harbor, got some takeout from Shake Shack, walked around waterfront, and bought a couple of bottles of water somewhere. This is what a successful tourist attraction is supposed to accomplish — you bring in retail dollars and tax revenue. We’ll come back post-pandemic and see the aquarium. It’s a nice place to visit. And Oliva shows that if you build a nice place to visit in the middle of a city, then the immediately adjacent homes become more desirable. Similarly, per Pearsall, if you clean up a brownfield the adjacent homes become more desirable.</p><p>New infill housing appears to empirically neutralize the induced demand by simultaneously inducing supply. But conceptually there’s a question here — is it bad to make neighborhoods better places to live? </p><h4>Better neighborhoods are better</h4><p>Here’s the problem. Consider the following argument:</p><ol><li><p>Constructing new buildings will bring new retail amenities to the neighborhood.</p></li><li><p>New amenities will make the neighborhood a more attractive place to live.</p></li><li><p>Because the neighborhood is now more attractive, prices will rise.</p></li><li><p>Rising prices will displace some existing residents.</p></li><li><p>Therefore we shouldn’t allow new buildings to be constructed.</p></li></ol><p>In place of (1) you could put all kinds of things:</p><ul><li><p>Constructing a new park</p></li><li><p>Reducing the crime rate</p></li><li><p>Renovating the local high school</p></li><li><p>Improving bus service to downtown</p></li><li><p>Fixing the potholes</p></li></ul><p>In other words, you could imagine this kind of logic becoming an infinite cycle of bad urban policy. Defund police will lead to more murders? Well, that’s good for housing affordability. …</p></div></div>
