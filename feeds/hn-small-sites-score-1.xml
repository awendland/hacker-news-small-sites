September 9, 2020 | https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>These are the five most annoying inaccessible web elements I face as a blind screen reader user every day, and how to fix them.
</span>
					</p><div>
						<p><span>For blind and visually impaired people like me, accessibility is the difference between us being able to use a website and clicking off it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>How screen readers work</h2>
<p><span>Screen readers allow blind and visually impaired people to use computers, phones and tablets independently. Most screen readers use software, and a Text To Speech (TTS) engine, which is what converts the text from the screen reader into speech. Screen readers convert the text displayed on screen into a format that blind users can process.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read out loud everything that’s on the screen and allow people to navigate using touch gestures and shortcut keys. They also work with other output devices such as a braille display.</span></p>
<p><span>As a screen reader user, here are the most common issues I encounter on a daily basis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2>Unlabelled links and buttons</h2>
<p><span>Screen reader users rely on links and buttons to navigate around a website and to find the information we need. If links and buttons are not labelled correctly or if at all, then it makes it difficult for screen reader users to find the information they need. Ultimately, unlabelled links make it much harder to navigate the website easily, quickly and independently.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, when linking to an about page, ‘click here’ doesn’t give any clue as to where it leads to, but ‘find out more about who we are’ is clear.</span></p>
<p><span>If links and buttons are labelled correctly, screen readers can read the label out loud. It means that blind and visually impaired people don’t have to press the link or button without knowing where it will take them.</span></p>
<p><span>As well as unlabelled elements, links and buttons that do not have a clear description are also really frustrating. They must have a clear description of where they will lead to when pressed, rather than ‘click here’. Never make your users guess where a link will take them or force them into a trial-and-error situation. This makes for tedious user experience.</span></p>
<h2>No image descriptions</h2>
<p><span>This is probably the most common issue I encounter when browsing the web.&nbsp;</span><span>Using image descriptions is essential for accessibility. Image descriptions are also known as alt text (alternative text) which is a written description of an image.</span></p>
<p><span>Screen readers read image descriptions out loud. This means that blind and visually impaired people can understand the content of the image in an accessible way.&nbsp;</span><span>If images do not have alt text, then screen readers will simply say “image” or “graphic” which gives no context or meaning.</span></p>
<p><span>Images often convey valuable information. It’s therefore important that people with a visual impairment can access this information as well.&nbsp;</span><span>Alt text should be clearly written and give an accurate description of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong>Check out <a href="https://bighack.org/how-to-write-better-alt-text-descriptions-for-accessibility/">our tips for writing better alt text</a> to ensure your images are fully accessible.</strong></p>
<h2>Poor use of headings</h2>
<p><span>For quick and easy navigation, many screen reader users navigate using various elements on the page such as headings. They are a great way to find the information we need quickly and effectively. Especially when they follow a logical heading structure with H1s, H2s and H3s helping to prioritise the content.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://625079.smushcdn.com/1339646/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Headings@2x.jpg?lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1" alt="Logical heading structure begins with Heading 1, with Heading 2 sitting beneath heading 1.

<p><span>If websites don’t use headings, it means screen reader users are unable to use the keyboard shortcuts to navigate through the webpage this way. If that’s the case, we have to resort to tabbing or arrowing through a long web page to find the information we need.</span></p>
<p>Headings also help to break up the web content visually and improve readability. Other elements that screen reader users use to navigate webpages include links, lists or landmarks.</p>
<h2>Inaccessible web forms</h2>
<p><span>Most websites use forms in one way or another. Whether it’s to help you search for a product or to get in touch through a contact form. However, when these forms are not labelled, or not labelled correctly, it means we cannot use them.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if a search box is not labelled, it means screen reader users have no idea of the purpose of that box. It means people who use screen readers cannot access the same functionality.</span></p>
<p><span>Contact forms are an effective way for customers to get in touch with your brand or business. And as a screen reader user, there’s nothing more frustrating than these forms being labelled incorrectly.</span></p>
<p><span>Especially CAPTCHA checkout requirements. Without an option to hear the audio, it’s not accessible. It means we are unable to fill in the form independently. I often have to enlist help from a sighted person, but this isn’t possible for everyone.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2>Auto-playing audio and video</h2>
<p><span>Most people will know how annoying it is to load a web page with noisy adverts that start playing suddenly. But for screen reader users, it can be even more alarming. When video or audio starts playing automatically, it can drown out the voice of the screen reader. This makes it harder to find the pause or stop buttons.</span></p>
<p><span>(And if these buttons are unlabelled, then it’s practically impossible for me to stop the video quickly which causes extra frustration.) If I’m unable to stop the sound or video, I normally click off.</span></p>
<p><span>The solution? Make sure there’s no auto-playing video or audio when your website loads. If you really want to use video, make sure the audio is muted and the user can pause, stop or hide the media player.</span></p>
<p><span>These issues may seem small to sighted users. But they’re the difference between me being able to use a website independently or not. And they make a huge difference when implemented correctly.</span></p>

frequently this involved bulky popups on pages with these controls having to display something
more complex than a few blocks of text.</p>

<p>Or, remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java applets</a>? They became
available in 1995, and later they weren’t limited to just Windows and Internet Explorer. I remember
I had to use Java applets on macOS as recently as 2013, which chronologically is closer to the
present time than the 90s are. (Feeling so old anyway! 👴)</p>

<p>Seems like ActiveX and Java applets were necessities mostly in the enterprise world, but
Macromedia Flash (later known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a>)
was certainly much more widely known to consumers. It was a requirement in the early days of streaming
video (even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7926001/youtube-drops-flash-for-html5-video-default">YouTube required
Flash</a>
to work back then!), but also a major driver in browser gaming in late 2000s and early 2010s.
We certainly could blame Flash for making our browser windows look like this:</p>

<p>While ActiveX has seemingly failed to reach a significant adoption, Microsoft made yet another
attempt with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Silverlight</a>:</p>

<p>It would be fair to say that these attempts failed to establish wide adoption, especially
after both consumers and businesses started shifting to mobile. Here’s how all these forays ended
according to Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft dropped ActiveX support from the Windows Store edition of Internet Explorer 10 in
Windows 8. In 2015 Microsoft released Microsoft Edge, the replacement for Internet Explorer with
no support for ActiveX, this marked the end of the technology in Microsoft’s web browser
development.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beginning in 2013, major web browsers began to phase out support for the underlying technology
applets used to run, with applets becoming completely unable to be run by 2015–2017. Java applets
were deprecated since Java 9 in 2017 and removed from Java SE 11 (18.9), released in September
2018.</p>

and will cease support, distribution, and security updates for Flash Player.</p>

<h2>But JavaScript solved all these problems, didn’t it?</h2>
<p>Most of these browser add-ons were introduced before modern JavaScript and HTML5 became available,
so one could argue you no longer need browser add-ons at all. Well, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/06/27/web-without-javascript">some
purists</a> even say browsers
should have never supported JavaScript or any scripting whatsoever in the first place. Nevertheless,
there are enough use cases for browser scripting and browser apps in general that are hard to avoid.
When looking at the history of browser plugins in general, it’s hard not to notice a few themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributing productivity apps via browsers is convenient in a lot of cases.</li>
<li>Browser gaming made a lot of sense, especially for casual games.</li>
<li>In both of these scenarios browsers had to display something more complex than text and a few
static images.</li>
</ul>

<p><small>The modern casual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower defense game genre</a>
arguably was reborn due to the popularity of Adobe Flash and browser gaming, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Element_TD">Flash Element
TD</a> being a classic example.</small></p>
<p>Even though native apps were (and in many situations still are) objectively better for users, early
browser apps were attempting to build their own ad-hoc app stores before the App Store existed.
You didn’t have to buy a CD with an application and install it and manage it on your disk. You
didn’t have to install updates manually and migrate your data. There was no need to uninstall apps,
you just close a corresponding browser tab and forget about it.</p>
<p>And when browser scripting capabilities became advanced enough, some people started seeing the
allure of making a browser version of their app the only version they provided. Browsers are
cross-platform, aren’t they? Just wrap your JavaScript app code in a browser-like container (say
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)">Electron</a>) and distribute that instead
of your native app. </p>
<p>But eventually not only the JavaScript APIs became more complex, the language itself could no longer
accommodate what developers wanted. Not everyone liked JavaScript syntax (remember
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript">CoffeeScript</a>?) or semantics (I couldn’t help but
notice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a> has grown in popularity in recent
years). But it’s hard to transpile an arbitrary programming language to JavaScript, the latter was
not built with that goal in mind.</p>
<p>Corollary, the JavaScript interpreter itself has both memory and performance overhead. Having a
garbage collector built in makes it even harder to transpile languages with different memory models
to JavaScript. The allure of having only one language to write all your apps for all platforms is
still there, but why do you have to be confined to JavaScript itself, even as a target language?</p>
<h2>How WebAssembly actually started</h2>
<p>With the death of browser plugins, at least we can praise the interoperability efforts of browser
vendors. Some lowest common denominator of JavaScript is supported in all browsers, and there is a
clear incentive for the vendors to keep up. With the demand to go beyond JavaScript, there were
initial attempts to support low level programming with asm.js in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of this performance gain over normal JavaScript [with asm.js was] due to 100% type consistency
and virtually no garbage collection (memory is manually managed in a large typed array).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">“asm.js”</a> article on Wikipedia.</small></p>
<p>Syntactically this still looked pretty much like JavaScript, but when you have a lot of low level code,
the resulting file can get big pretty quickly, and the size of your code is pretty important when your
users download it frequently. As you weren’t supposed to write asm.js code manually most of the time,
and it was designed primarily as compilation target, it made sense to invent a binary format for it.
That’s basically how WebAssembly started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly was first announced in 2015, and the first demonstration was executing Unity’s Angry
Bots in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. The precursor technologies were asm.js from
Mozilla and Google Native Client, and the initial implementation was based on the feature set of
asm.js.</p>

<h2>What WebAssembly got right</h2>
<p>Now you’re no longer restricted to JavaScript as a target language for browser apps. As soon as
<a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> got WebAssembly backend more or less ready, it allowed compilers built
on top of LLVM (for C, C++, Rust, Swift and many more) to adopt it without rewriting everything from
scratch. This unlocked the browser environment to a huge amount of pre-existing software that can
also run close to native speed if optimized well.</p>
<p>Not only can you run fun little projects such as <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a> and
<a href="https://orb.farm/">orb.farm</a> in your browser tab, but complex games such as <a href="https://www.continuation-labs.com/projects/d3wasm/">Doom
3</a> (at least its demo version) are available too.
Both <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/08/15/webassembly-is-here/">Unity</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/unrealengine/status/932624595722559490">Unreal
Engine</a> announced their support for
WebAssembly, and while we may not see AAA games running in browsers on their initial release date,
this still gives enough confidence in the maturity of the platform.</p>

<p>It’s obviously not limited to games, as we can see Apple folks compiling their <a href="https://twitter.com/lrz/status/1250453967957561344">C++ and Objective-C
code from iWork</a> to Wasm<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, or
<a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a> using it in their browser extension getting substantial
performance improvements as a result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With our move to WebAssembly, page filling and analysis now runs at least twice as fast as before,
and those websites with a large number of fields are up to 13x faster in Chrome and up to 39x
faster in Firefox! It’s blazing fast. 🔥</p>

<h2>Wasm is a general purpose virtual machine</h2>
<p>Not only you get performance improvements with WebAssembly compared to JavaScript, as it was
designed to run arbitrary code in your browser, it’s one of the most widely available secure sandbox
environments. And as a general purpose virtual machine, Wasm is not limited only to browsers.
<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> uses it for edge computing on their CDN:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re excited by the possibilities that WebAssembly opens up. Perhaps, by integrating with
Cloudflare Spectrum, we could allow existing C/C++ server code to handle arbitrary TCP and UDP
protocols on the edge, like a sort of massively-distributed inetd. Perhaps game servers could
reduce latency by running on Cloudflare, as close to the player as possible. Maybe, with the help
of some GPUs and OpenGL bindings, you could do 3D rendering and real-time streaming directly from
the edge.</p>

Workers”</a> on <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/">the Cloudflare
blog</a>.</small></p>
<p>With people realizing the wide applicability of the Wasm tech stack, it was no surprise when
<a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> (stands for WebAssembly System Interface) appeared. Where WebAssembly
itself is a “bare metal” platform, it does not supply any primitives such as memory allocation or
filesystem access, which WASI does provide. As Solomon Hykes, creator of Docker, <a href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225">puts
it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn’t have needed to created Docker. That’s how important it
is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p>Pipenv is a Python packaging tool that does one thing reasonably well — application dependency management. However, it is also plagued by issues, limitations and a break-neck development process. In the past, Pipenv’s promotional material was highly misleading as to its purpose and backers.</p>
<p>In this post, I will explore the problems with Pipenv. Was it really
recommended by Python.org? Can everyone — or at least, the vast majority
of people — benefit from it?</p>
<p>(This post has been updated in February 2020 and May 2020 to reflect the
current state of Pipenv.)</p>

<h2><a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id14">A 2020 update (updated)</a><a href="#a-2020-update-updated" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This blog post was written in 2018, and it’s still pretty accurate when it
comes to the criticisms of Pipenv, but something else happened since then.</p>
<p>No release was made between November 2018 and May 2020. Pipenv was effectively
dead for 1.5 years, and the state of Pipenv maintenance is alarming.</p>
<p>A release of Pipenv was made in late 2018 (aptly named v2018.11.26). But then,
there was silence. New commits were made (on the order of 600-700 by the end of
the year). People asked for new releases, in more or less strong words, <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3742">in May
2019</a>, then <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3978">in October</a>, and again <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4058">in December</a>. Many people — including yours
truly, in this post — considered Pipenv dead. On 13th December 2019, the current
maintainer claimed <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/4058#issuecomment-565550646">a new release is almost finished</a>.</p>
<p>Pipenv 2019/2020 was vaporware for five months. Not much progress was made since the
December post until March 2020, when an issue from 2018 was renamed the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/3369">March 2020
Release Tracking Issue</a>. Some
progress was happening, and many release dates were given, but delays stacked
up. March became April. The first beta release was promised by 21st April, it
was delayed until the 29th. The final release was scheduled for a week from
that, but it didn’t happen. Finally, Beta 2 came out on 20th May 2020, and the
final release landed as v2020.5.28.</p>
<p>If you read further into the post, you’ll encounter a chapter titled <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#the-break-neck-pace-of-pipenv">The
break-neck pace of Pipenv</a>. Am I being a hypocrite right now? No, not at all.
Projects that are being depended on, such as a package manager, should have
clear policies about how they’re maintained. A new release when the maintainer
feels like adding a feature is too often. A new release every 1.5 years is not
often enough. And silence from maintainers, when faced with questions about
releases, is simply unacceptable.  Pip, for example, has updates every few
months in a fairly stable pace (with the exception of emergency bugfix
releases), and pip has years of development behind it, unlike the fairly new
Pipenv.</p>
<p>And even if the May release was successful, you can’t be sure about any future
releases, and what will happen with Pipenv. At the same time, Pipenv isn’t a
good tool, as this post tries to explain — those criticisms are still valid,
since they are at the core of what Pipenv is. Instead, perhaps consider using
<strong>pip-tools</strong> for locking dependencies? It does one thing, and one thing well.
It doesn’t enforce any specific structures on users, and supports any workflow
you have. (If you don’t need to lock dependencies, <strong>pip + venv</strong> will
suffice.)</p>

<p>We’ve already learned that Pipenv is used to <em>manage application dependencies</em>.
Let’s learn what that term really means.</p>
<div id="application-dependencies">
<h3><a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id17">Application dependencies</a><a href="#application-dependencies" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Here is an example use case for Pipenv:
I’m working on a website based on Django.  I create <code>~/git/website</code> and run
<code>pipenv install Django</code> in that directory.  Pipenv:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>automatically creates a virtualenv somewhere in my home directory</p></li>
<li><p>writes a Pipfile, which lists Django as my dependency</p></li>
<li><p>installs Django using pip</p></li>
<li><p>proceeds to write <code>Pipfile.lock</code>, which stores the exact version and source file hash <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id11" id="id5">2</a> of each package installed (including <code>pytz</code>, Django’s dependency).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last part of the process was the most time consuming. At one point, while
locking the dependency versions, Pipenv hangs for 46 seconds. This is one of
Pipenv’s notable issues: <strong>it’s slow.</strong> Of course, this isn’t the only one,
but it defintely doesn’t help. Losing 46 seconds isn’t much, but when we get to
the longer waits in the timing test section later, we’ll see something that
could easily discourage users from using a package.</p>
</div>
<div id="running-scripts-badly">
<h3><a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id18">Running scripts (badly)</a><a href="#running-scripts-badly" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>But let’s continue with our workflow. <code>pipenv run <span>django-admin</span> startproject
foobanizer</code> is what I must use now, which is rather unwieldy to type, and
requires running pipenv even for the smallest things. (The <code>manage.py</code> script
has <code>/usr/bin/env python</code> in its shebang.) I can run <code>pipenv shell</code> to get
a new shell which runs the <code>activate</code> script by default, giving you the worst
of both worlds when it comes to virtualenv activation: the unwieldiness of a
new shell, and the activate script, which the proponents of the shell spawning
dislike.</p>
<p>Using <code>pipenv shell</code> means spawning a new subshell, executing the shell
startup scripts (eg. <code>.bashrc</code>), and requiring you to exit with <code>exit</code> or
^D. If you type <code>deactivate</code>, you are working with an extra shell, but now
outside of the virtualenv. Or you can use the <code><span>--fancy</span></code> mode that manipulates
<code>$PATH</code> before launching the subshell, but it requires a specific shell
configuration, in which <code>$PATH</code> is not overridden in non-login shells — and
also often changing the config of your terminal emulator to run a login shell,
as many of the Linux terminals don’t do it.</p>
<p>Now, why does all this happen? Because a command cannot manipulate the
environment of the shell it spawns. This means that Pipenv must pretend what it
does is a reasonable thing instead of a workaround. This can be solved with
manual activation using <code>source $(pipenv <span>--venv)/bin/activate</span></code> (can be made
into a neat alias), or shell wrappers (similar to what virtualenvwrapper does).</p>

<p>Anyway, I want a blog on my site. I want to write them in Markdown syntax, so I
run <code>pipenv install Markdown</code>, and a few long seconds later, it’s added to
both Pipfiles.  Another thing I can do is <code>pipenv install <span>--dev</span> ipython</code> and
get a handy shell for tinkering, but it will be marked as a development
dependency — so, not installed in production. That last part is an important
advantage of using Pipenv.</p>
<p>When I’m done working on my website, I commit both Pipfiles to my git
repository, and push it to the remote server. Then I can clone it to, say,
<code>/srv/website</code>. Now I can just <code>pipenv install</code> to get all the production
packages installed (but not the development ones — Django, pytz, Markdown will
be installed, but IPython and all its million dependencies won’t). There’s just
one caveat: by default, the virtualenv will still be created in the current
user’s home directory. This is a problem in this case, since it needs to be
accessible by <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/">nginx and uWSGI</a>, which do not have access to my (or root’s)
home directory, and don’t have a home directory of their own.  This can be
solved with <code>export PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1</code>. But note that I will now need
to export this environment variable every time I work with the app in <code>/srv</code>
via Pipenv. The tool supports loading <code>.env</code> files, <strong>but</strong> only when
running <code>pipenv shell</code> and <code>pipenv run</code>. You can’t use it to configure
Pipenv. And to run my app with nginx/uWSGI, I will need to know the exact virtualenv
path anyway, since I can’t use <code>pipenv run</code> as part of uWSGI configuration.</p>

<p>The workflow I mentioned above looks pretty reasonable, right? There are some
deficiencies, but other than that, it seems to work well. The main issue with
Pipenv is: <strong>it works with one workflow, and one workflow only.</strong> Try to do
anything else, and you end up facing multiple obstacles.</p>
<div id="setup-py-source-distributions-and-wheels">

<p>Pipenv only concerns itself with managing dependencies. <strong>It isn’t a packaging
tool.</strong> If you want your thing up on PyPI, Pipenv won’t help you with anything.
You still need to write a <code>setup.py</code> with <code>install_requires</code>, because the
Pipfile format only specifies the dependencies and runtime requirements (Python
version), there is no place in it for the package name, and Pipenv does not
mandate/expect you to install your project. It can come in handy to manage the
development environment (as a <code>requirements.txt</code> replacement, or something
used to write said file), but if your project has a <code>setup.py</code>, you still
need to manually manage <code>install_requires</code>. Pipenv can’t create wheels on its
own either. And <code>pip freeze</code> is going to be a lot faster than Pipenv ever
will be.</p>

<p>Another issue with Pipenv is the use of the working directory to select
the virtual environment. <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/#id12" id="id6">3</a> Let’s say I’m a library author.  A user of my <code>foobar</code>
library has just reported a bug and attached a <code>repro.py</code> file that lets me
reproduce the issue. I download that file to <code>~/Downloads</code> on my filesystem.
With plain old virtualenv, I can easily confirm the reproduction in a spare
shell with:</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_b2c36cceaad445ed8626dfd9baf7bf01-1"></a>$ ~/virtualenvs/foobar/bin/python ~/Downloads/repro.py
</pre>
<p>And then I can launch my fancy IDE to fix the bug.  I don’t have to <code>cd</code> into
the project. But with Pipenv, I can’t really do that.  If I put the virtualenv
in <code>.venv</code> with the command line option, I can type
<code><span>~/git/foobar/.venv/bin/python</span> ~/Downloads/repro.py</code>. If I use the
centralized directory + hashes thing, Tab completion becomes mandatory, if I
haven’t memorized the hash.</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_64a4d0d59b30481ba482b52371717113-1"></a>$ <span>cd</span> ~/git/foobar
<a name="rest_code_64a4d0d59b30481ba482b52371717113-2"></a>$ pipenv run python ~/Downloads/repro.py
</pre>
<p>What if I had two <code>.py</code> files, or <code>repro.py</code> otherwise depended on being in
the current working directory?</p>
<pre><a name="rest_code_3d2d08d802964358a58c3deeea48c8fd-1"></a>$ <span>cd</span> ~/git/foobar
<a name="rest_code_3d2d08d802964358a58c3deeea48c8fd-2"></a>$ pipenv shell

</pre>
<p><strong>This is becoming ugly fairly quickly.</strong> Also, with virtualenvwrapper, I can

<p>This blogpost presents intuition and experimental results for Gated Linear Networks, a new family of neural networks introduced by DeepMind in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01526.pdf">recent paper</a>. Accompanying implementations in JAX, NumPy, PyTorch and TensorFlow can be found <a href="https://github.com/aiwabdn/pygln">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-gated-linear-network">What is a Gated Linear Network?</h2>

<p>A <strong>Gated Linear Network (GLN)</strong> is a collection of <strong>data-dependent neurons</strong>, arranged in a sequence of layers. Instead of predicting the target output only at the final layer, as is usually the case in deep learning, each neuron predicts the output directly, computes the error and updates its weights locally in an online fashion. In the following, we will explain the various components of a GLN in more detail. We will start off by describing how a <strong>neuron</strong> works.</p>

<p>Imagine an expert who, given an input, is supposed to make a <strong>binary decision</strong> and report their prediction as a probability value. This expert considers two types of data when making their decision: the input itself, and a set of prediction probabilities for the same decision from a panel of other experts. The expert then performs the following steps to arrive at their own decision:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Conditioned on the input, choose one decision rule from a fixed set of rules which the expert maintains internally. In the paper, this process is implemented as <strong>halfspace gating</strong> and called the <strong>context function</strong>, since the input provides the “context” which determines how the decision is made. This context function is akin to <strong>locality-sensitive hashing</strong>, as similar inputs are supposed to map to the same decision rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the chosen decision rule to combine the prediction probabilities of the panel of other experts. In the paper, each decision rule consists of a set of weights which are used to aggregate the panel probabilities via <strong>geometric mixing</strong>. So the expert effectively refines the decisions of the panel, relying more on some experts than on others, depending on the context, i.e. the input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By comparing their prediction with the expected output, the expert adjusts the selected set of weights which has produced this decision, by shifting them slightly in the direction which encourages the correct decision in the future.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The following awesome stick figure sketch attempts to visualize this:</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/expert2.png" alt="panel-of-experts"></p>

<p>We can think of the layers in a GLN as panels of such experts. Each expert/neuron in a layer considers the previous layer as their panel of experts. Consequently, the prediction of the target output gets iteratively refined through the sequence of layers, until a last single-neuron layer makes the final decision, which is taken as the network output. Different from typical deep neural networks, however, the output of each neuron is directly interpretable and updated locally, as opposed to globally via backpropagation through the entire network.</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts">Core concepts</h2>

<p>With that intuition in place, let us look at the main mathematical concepts underlying a neuron in more detail. Henceforth, we will refer to an “expert” as a <strong>neuron</strong> and to a “panel” as a <strong>layer</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="halfspace-gating">Halfspace gating</h3>

<p>We have seen how each neuron has its own <strong>context function</strong> which it uses to choose a decision rule conditioned on the input. Since the neuron should use the same decision rule for similar inputs, the context function should map regions of the input space to the same context. One way to achieve this is to divide the space into <strong>halfspaces</strong> and compute region membership based on which halfspace an input point belongs to, but other methods, for instance, based on a fixed number of representative points, could be used instead.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a two-dimensional input space and an input point \((x_0, y_0)\). Any straight line divides the space into two halves, and our point lies either to the left (0) or right (1) of the line. So every line gives us a binary value indicating, very roughly, in which region of the input space our point is located.</p>

<p><img src="https://aiwabdn.github.io/pygln/assets/images/context_function.png" alt="context-function"></p>

<p>We can consider the point’s position relative to multiple lines and combine the binary results to form a binary string. In general, if we draw \(n\) lines, we get a binary string of length \(n\) with \(2^n\) possible values, i.e., sub-regions. This operation forms the basis of how the <strong>context function</strong> computes context identifiers given an input point. A neuron interprets this binary string as number and uses it as index into an array of \(2^n\) different set of weights, thus making a <strong>data-dependent choice</strong> of which linear function to apply.</p>

<p>In the figure above, the context function consists of \(3\) lines, shown in red, green and blue, which divide the space into \(2^3 = 8\) regions, indexed by integers from \([0, 7]\). When passed through the context function, input \((x_0, y_0)\) produces the binary string <em>“010”</em>, i.e. index \(2\), and point \((x_1, y_1)\) produces <em>“110”</em>, i.e. index \(6\).</p>

<p>Let’s see how that might look in code.</p>

<h3 id="geometric-mixing">Geometric mixing</h3>

<p>A neuron takes the probabilistic predictions of the previous layer and combines them using the context-selected weights to produce a prediction of its own. This is implemented as <strong>geometric mixing</strong>, that is, a dot product of the weights and the prediction logits of the previous layer and subsequent sigmoid:</p><p>

\[\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) = \sigma(w^\mathrm{T} \cdot \sigma^{-1}(p)) = \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i}}{\prod_{i=1}^{d}p_i^{w_i} + \prod_{i=1}^{d}(1 - p_i)^{w_i}},\]

</p><p>where \(\mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p)\) represents the mixed output when the ground truth is \(1\).</p>

<p>Conceptually, this implements a kind of voting mechanism:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights are \(0\), i.e. no weight is given to any input, then the output is \(0.5\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all weights have the uniform value \(\frac{1}{d}\) (\(d\) being the number of neurons in the previous layer), i.e. equal weighting, then the output is the geometric mean of the predictions of the previous layer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moreover, <strong>vetoing</strong> is possible in the sense that if one neuron from the previous layer has predicted a probability close to \(0\) and the weight assigned to that prediction is greater than \(0\), then the output is pushed towards \(0\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the neuron sees more samples, it learns which of the predictions of the previous layer to pay more attention to. So in a sense a neuron behaves like an expert who, given a certain type of input, learns the best way to combine decisions from other experts based on their area of expertise, to arrive at their own judgement. This also demonstrates the difference between a GLN and a normal neural network. Usually, the neurons of the intermediate layers of a neural network learn to combine “features” from the previous layers to produce a higher-order “feature” value. However, the features themselves do not have any (extrinsic) semantic meaning or obvious interpretation. That is why the weights of intermediate layers can only be updated via backpropagation after the final output has been computed, since it is the only interpretable value and can thus be optimized. A neuron in a GLN, on the other hand, is directly predicting the output and can consequently learn immediately from its mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="online-gradient-descent">Online gradient descent</h3>

<p>Now that we know how a neuron chooses weights based on the input, and uses them to mix the outputs of a previous layer of neurons to produce its own output, let’s see how it learns to update the weights in training.</p>

<p>Using the standard logarithmic loss, it can be shown that the gradient consists of scaling the difference between the output and the ground truth \(y\) by the logit of the output probability:</p><p>

\[\nabla \mathcal{L}^\mathrm{GEO}(w) = \nabla \big( -\log \mathrm{GEO}^y_w(p) \big) = \big( \mathrm{GEO}^1_w(p) - y \big) \cdot \mathrm{logit}(p).\]

</p><p>This value is then multiplied with the learning rate to arrive at the update for the weights used for the current data point by the neuron. This update can be performed for every neuron as soon as it predicts the output, so there is no need for a separate forward and backward pass during training. Contrary to a regular deep neural network, where the loss is computed at the final layer and the gradients are propagated backwards, layer by layer, a GLN will hence not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients. Moreover, given enough expressive …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>The original founders of the major programming languages and computer systems are still alive today. They’ve had every opportunity to change with the times. They, after all, know innovation. They inspired us. They still do.</p>

<p>I’ll never understand a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Jackson Polloc</a> painting, but I do understand this art shown above.</p>
<p>The first two guys listed have very valid reasons for making their sites this way, distilled down perfectly to the last drop of the purest logic. The last two guys are just trolling us.</p>
<p><em>I was going to list <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck">Mark Zuckerberg’s</a> homepage (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091101062708/http://www.facebook.com/zuck">archive 1</a>) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200805074602/https://www.facebook.com/zuck">archive 2</a>) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831024214if_/https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0251986/">archive 3</a>) but it turns out he is sharing it with about 2.7 billion other people. It also presented compatibility issues by being listed on the same page with Richard Stallman.</em></p>

<h2 id="why-basic-flat-html-sites-are-best-for-most-of-us">Why Basic Flat HTML Sites Are Best for Most of Us</h2>
<h3 id="html-site--longevity">HTML Site = Longevity</h3>
<p>Being a zealous Christian, I’m a big fan of longevity. And, to me, there is nothing more enduring on the web than a basic HTML website.</p>
<p>You can host an HTML site, literally, for FREE, beautiful and complex…and it will be here later on when future post-world-war-3 generations finally find the <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">GitHub Archive Program</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831170906/https://archiveprogram.github.com/">archive</a>) (provided you use <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831111818/https://pages.github.com/">archive</a>), I think…).</p>
<p>Lets be realistic. If you are like most people, you will probably abandon your site when you realize its pointless. But if you did it in HTML, it will still be here 20 years from now, even if you never touched it again. Just ask Linus Torvolds.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200731110209/https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/syntaxerror.png">WordPress and other CMS’s will not do that for you…</a>)</p>
<h3 id="static-sites-can-handle-traffic">Static Sites Can Handle Traffic</h3>
<p>If you go viral and get inundated with traffic, an HTML flat site can handle it. Even if its running on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">Raspberry Pi</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200708214027/https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/">archive</a>). By comparison, statistically speaking, CMS’s that begin with the letter “W” can crash a high-end dedicated server under the same conditions.</p>
<h3 id="faster-sites-keep-attention">Faster Sites Keep Attention</h3>
<p>A static HTML page is lighting fast. And since all humans presently living have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder">ADD</a> audience retention will always be at max with an HTML site.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://clipartillustration.com/">my illustrator’s site of 24,000 images</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200824034652/https://clipartillustration.com/">archive</a>) (produced via graphical spam methods) doesn’t even need a search bar, since users can page through the images so fast.</p>
<h3 id="indistinguishable-from-dynamic-sites">Indistinguishable from Dynamic Sites</h3>
<p>Because of new web technologies, you can actually run a store on a flat HTML site. You can have a contact form (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070223013719/http://101526.iboox.com/">a Guestbook?!</a>), and user comments. Alot has changed.</p>
<h3 id="html-sites-are-pro-sanity">HTML Sites are Pro-Sanity</h3>
<p>Databases, plugins, environments, ports, updates, downdates, backwards compatibility…this list could be very long… all gone. Along with your mental oppression. Just upload the files and be done with it.</p>
<p>This means you will have much more time for your more basic human needs, such as finding time to look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200827155759/https://cheezburger.com/1633029/33-funny-cat-memes-that-never-fail-to-make-us-lol">cat memes</a>.</p>
<p>Because in the end, the internet was not created for you. It exists for cat memes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the <a href="https://mrpicky.dev/see-how-i-failed-at-my-saas-idea-and-what-you-will-gain-from-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="previous post (opens in a new tab)">previous post</a>, I described in great detail what we are going to do in the next few months. Today I would like to give you some insights into what was going on in my head when I was trying to launch that SaaS idea. This post is some kind of “behind the scenes” type of text. I’m going to show you how the idea was born, how I “validated” it, how much time and effort I invested in it, and finally how I failed. To sum it up, I will show you <strong>how to probably not start the project</strong>.</p>



<h2>An idea was born</h2>



<p>Like a lot of great ideas in this world, also this one had its dawn of time in… a drunk night. Well, I met my friend after a few months, and he said it would be cool to have a headhunter company. That company would verify developers and put them on their website in some kind of “auctions.” You may think of it as Amazon or eBay with developers ;). The idea popped up after I told him about the money I earned from recommending my friends for some job offers. As you can imagine, after a few shots, we were really optimistic about our great business model. We even talked about it a few times after that night. But an idea without execution is nothing, so suddenly it failed for its first time.</p>



<p>Later on, I was working on a project where such a reversed model of search used to work pretty well. That gave me extra energy to try one more time. I changed the idea quite drastically, as I wanted to remove everything, to skip the verification process and the need to run a headhunter company. The new idea was to just give developers the ability to add new advertisements – a simple CRUD application. On the other hand , there would be a search feature that recruiters would use. A few days of work and I could live my rich life ;).</p>



<p>At the same time, I read articles and listened to podcasts that were talking about problems in the hiring process. After “research,” I got to some conclusions that you can find in the previous post, so if you haven’t read it yet, catch up with it :). The idea was born at that stage, and my side project got the “DFS” codename, which stands for “Developers For Sale.” Yup, I know, sounds scary, but I can assure you – I was not objectifying developers ;). I had to think about a new name, and we will get to that soon. First, I would like to show you my business validation.</p>



<h2>The idea’s “validation”</h2>



<p>A real entrepreneur knows that before doing anything, the business idea should be validated. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I decided to create a pool. The problem was that I was pretty fixed on my vision of the final product, and I didn’t want to change it in any way. Instead of asking about pains in the hiring process, I asked users to anonymously leave their skills, desired location of work, and how much they would like to earn. Thanks to this, I was able to validate whether people are not afraid of sharing such a piece of information.</p>



<p>Ok, so at that point, I was set about what I was going to ask, but I had no idea where I could let people know about the pool. I had no audience at all. Asking people directly or on any Internet groups was a blocker for me. Luckily, a friend of mine is an IT blogger/vlogger, and he allowed me to put a short video on his vlog. That was actually an excellent idea, but at the same time, that’s the end of my entrepreneurial skills… Any business-oriented person would grab a smartphone to record a 2-min video, then would take some tool for creating surveys and create one in the next 5 mins. But no, I know better, I have to go “professional.” I need a name, a logo, designs. Moreover, a video had to be recorded by another friend of mine who does this daily. There had to be music in the background, my name popping-up, and a big logo, at the end of the video.</p>



<p>As a result, the survey itself ended up looking as follows:</p>



<figure><img src="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmj_ankieta-831x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmj_ankieta-831x1024.jpg 831w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmj_ankieta-243x300.jpg 243w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmj_ankieta-768x947.jpg 768w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmj_ankieta-1246x1536.jpg 1246w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dmj_ankieta.jpg 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 831px) 100vw, 831px"></figure>



<p>After filling in the form and submitting it, a user was redirected to a “thank you” page. There were social media widgets to allow sharing, and a form to leave an email address. You may think now that something is not right here – I was talking about anonymity, and now I ask people to leave their email. Believe me or not, but I was really serious about the anonymity of users in that product. That said, I can assure you, that email form on the thank you page was not connected in any way to the survey. The only purpose was to build a mailing list of people interested in what was going on.</p>



<p>When all that was ready, my video was added to the vlog’s episode. There were no details about the product itself, just asking people to take part in the survey. I don’t recall exactly, but the numbers were around: 300 took part in the survey, and 100 subscribed to the mailing list. That was a great success for me.</p>



<h2>First things first</h2>



<p>Now let’s focus on “the most important” things in running your own business: the name and the logo. How are people going to fill in the form if there is no logo and name? Yup… That was me thinking about business back then ;). Nevertheless, the story is quite interesting, so I will describe it here.</p>



<p>Some time ago, I was working on a small side project with a guy who got his Ph.D. in History of Art. He came up with the name and designs for that project. I really liked them and the whole idea behind them. That’s why I asked him for help, as “Developers For Sale” doesn’t sound good ;). As he is also a Linux user, after a few days, he got back to me with the idea of “mounting a new job by developer” from a command line. Like you would mount a resource in Linux. It would look like this in CLI:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_consola.png" alt="" srcset="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_consola.png 327w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_consola-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 327px) 100vw, 327px"></figure></div>



<p>I was delighted. This was not only because of a reference to a command line but also as there was a “$” sign. Moreover, “mount” can bring to mind mountains (Mount Everest), which may be a reference to the career path. Mind blown, isn’t it?</p>



<p>Then I described the whole idea to the designer, and after a few days, I got such visualizations:</p>



<figure><img src="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<figure><img src="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/logo_v2.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The first one got my attention, but now when I look at them, maybe I would choose the second one, as it’s a bit retro. Which one do you like better?</p>



<p>Both of them refer to a command line, and both have a “$” sign. Maybe its meaning is not so obvious when you take a look at it for the first time, but I was really proud of it. In case of earning millions of dollars on my new SaaS, I was prepared to explain this deep meaning in interviews ;).</p>



<h2>Designs</h2>



<p>I knew what kind of views/pages I wanted to have, so I prepared quite detailed mockups. I sent them and a project description to the designer, and,&nbsp; after a few days, I had the first version that I accepted. You can see them below:</p>



<figure><img src="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwhome-2_1-1024x864.png" alt="" srcset="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwhome-2_1-1024x864.png 1024w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwhome-2_1-300x253.png 300w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwhome-2_1-768x648.png 768w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwhome-2_1-1536x1296.png 1536w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwhome-2_1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<figure><img src="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwprogramista-java_2-994x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwprogramista-java_2-994x1024.png 994w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwprogramista-java_2-291x300.png 291w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwprogramista-java_2-768x791.png 768w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwprogramista-java_2-1491x1536.png 1491w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wwwprogramista-java_2.png 1553w" sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px"></figure>



<h2>We are almost there…</h2>



<p>Now the fun begins. Long story short, while working on designs, I asked the designer to also prepare designs for the survey form. Everyone knows it has to be custom, with a logo, etc. Instead of taking some out of the box survey tool, I decided to develop it from scratch and host on Elastic Beanstalk, as I really like AWS services. So I did…</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/facepalm-300x169.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/facepalm-300x169.jpg 300w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/facepalm-768x432.jpg 768w, https://mrpicky.dev/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/facepalm.jpg 895w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>



<p>A few days later, the survey was deployed and was ready for traffic. Results I showed you a few chapters earlier.</p>



<h2>The “post-survey” era</h2>



<p>After initial success, I was thinking about how to get my great product even more traffic. I thought that content marketing would do the job there. My thinking was as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>write an article (mentioned in the previous post, link <a href="https://medium.com/@StolarczykT/lets-turn-the-dev-hiring-process-upside-down-62620a3f5c7c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="here (opens in a new tab)">here</a>),</li><li>submit it to Hacker News,</li><li>watch the mailing list grow to thousands of emails.</li></ol>



<p>Well, as you can expect – it didn’t happen.</p>



<p>Writing an article took me quite a lot of time. I had some doubts that people reading it would hear my Central European accent, so I sent it to review to a friend of mine who is a great philologist. Fortunately, it was quite good, and only a few more natural collocations were added. Moreover, I thought that instead of stock photos, I would like to have some eye-catching sketches, so I asked a drafter to do them. Then everything was ready, I could submit my article about changing the world to HN and… nothing happened. I saw in Medium’s statistics that people were reading it, but only a few subscribed to the mailing list. Then I was sending back the link to the article in reply messages to job offers that I was getting at that time. It turned out that recruiters were quite interested in the idea. I was noting their contact details to let them know when I was ready with my product as I was supposed “to start soon.” As an idea without execution is nothing, I’ve never got back to them.</p>



<p>We got to the stage when I got really tired of all that “entrepreneurial life.” I was thinking of delegating the implementation of the prototype to another friend of mine. He wanted to play a bit with AWS, so we cut a deal pretty quickly as it was a win-win situation. A month later, I had a clickable prototype that I didn’t show to anybody. I think that besides personal reasons for not launching it, I also lost faith in its success. Some kind of excuses appeared, that probably would be better identified here by some coaching gurus, so let’s leave it here for them 😉</p>



<h2>What went wrong?</h2>



<p>You probably already know what went wrong, but let me say that loudly. I focused on totally not important things, instead of focusing on my potential clients, getting to know their pains, observing them, analyzing their behavior, supporting them, and building a community. I did research supposedly, but that’s like with any other research – you can come up with such results that will support any thesis. Worst of all, I was defending the idea only because I wanted to do it.</p>



<p>With the benefit of hindsight and after seeing some success stories, I can admit that those totally unnecessary activities were: logo, designs, video, drawings, article, overthinking… All that consumed too much of my time, energy, and money. As a result, nothing was left for delivering real value and solving other people’s problems. That’s why I’d advise against taking such an approach …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been working on user documentation for
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>. As is the case for most
product documentation, screenshots are the most time consuming aspect
of this process.</p><p>Generating them is one half of the picture. Keeping them up to date
as the product evolves is another challenge.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a way to automate this.</p><video width="100%" height="auto" autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" poster="https://nicolodavis.com/autogenerate-screenshot.png"><source src="https://nicolodavis.com/autogenerate-screenshot.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h3>E2E Testing Tools</h3><p>Turns out that most E2E testing tools for the web have the ability to
generate screenshots. I use <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright">Playwright</a>
with tests written using <a href="https://codecept.io/">CodeceptJS</a> (I find the
API more readable than using Playwright directly).</p><p>Other tools like <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> and
<a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a> have similar capabilities, so pick one
that you’re comfortable with.</p><p>The code to generate a screenshot in <a href="https://codecept.io/">CodeceptJS</a> looks something like this:</p><div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>Feature</span><span>(</span><span>'Test'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<!-- -->
<span>Scenario</span><span>(</span><span>'save screenshot'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>I</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<!-- -->  <span>I</span><span>.</span><span>amOnPage</span><span>(</span><span>'/'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<!-- -->  <span>I</span><span>.</span><span>saveScreenshot</span><span>(</span><span>'screenshot.png'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><h3>Hooking it up with your build process</h3><p>We want to add our screenshot generating code directly to the Markdown
file holding the user documentation and have it automagically replace
that with an image of the final screenshot.</p><div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span>#</span> Boardgame Lab documentation</span>
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Documentation text.<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>screenshot</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<!-- -->  <!-- -->I.amOnPage("/")<!-- -->
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>screenshot</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The general strategy is to extract the content of <code>&lt;screenshot&gt;</code> tags
and copy them over to JavaScript files which are then
converted to screenshots via <a href="https://codecept.io/">CodeceptJS</a>.
The way I’ve set it up, the extraction logic also provides the boilerplate,
including the <code>saveScreenshot</code> line.</p><p><img alt="diagram" src="https://nicolodavis.com/autogenerate-screenshot-diagram.png"></p><p>This can be done in many ways. My documentation site is written in
<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and uses <a href="https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX">MDsveX</a>,
which provides a convenient <a href="https://mdsvex.com/docs#remarkplugins--rehypeplugins">hook</a>
to parse HTML tags from Markdown files.</p><p>In theory you could use something other than HTML tags to demarcate
the JavaScript code, but this format allows passing in additional
parameters which are useful. For example, you could specify the size
of the screenshot or the actual element you want to screenshot (if
you don’t want to capture the entire page).</p><div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>screenshot</span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>640<span>"</span></span> <span>height</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>480<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<!-- -->  <!-- -->I.amOnPage("/")<!-- -->
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>screenshot</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3><p>I like this approach because not only does it automate the generation of
screenshots, the code to generate those screenshots are actual tests that
serve to validate the correctness of the application!</p><p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/boardgamelab/docs/blob/master/screenshot.js">link</a></p></div></div>]]>

This visual illusion is an artifact of our evolution and secures our survival, explains a recent article in <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-08-brain-everyday.html">MedicalXpress</a>. “We process these “fake” faces using the same visual mechanisms of the brain that we do for real ones,” it notes.&nbsp;“Our brain has evolved to facilitate social interaction, and this shapes the way that we see the world around us.”</p>



<p>So, no surprise, that the gingerbread houses have been a favorite of Vineyard visitors for years; our brain sees them as waiting to see us! As the pareidolia researcher Dr. Colin Palmer says:&nbsp;“We know that the object doesn’t really have a mind, but <em>we can’t help but see it as having mental characteristics</em> like a ‘direction of gaze’ because of mechanisms in our visual system that become active when they detect an object with basic face-like features.”</p>
<p>Sensing face-like cottage facades makes us feel at home in a space, keeps us coming back and makes the visits memorable. &nbsp;In the Vineyard, there’s another good place to appreciate the power of <em>pareidolia,</em>&nbsp;moving beyond&nbsp;architecture; it’s at <a href="https://mvmagazine.com/news/2019/07/01/encyclopedia-vineyardia-t">Toad Rock</a>, a historic site on Native American, Wampanoag, tribal land, in Acquinnah, twenty miles to the west.</p>

<p>Here’s a place people have visited for <em>thousands of years</em>, and once there, you get why; it provides that one design element people most need to see to secure themselves in a space: a face.</p>



<p>The upshot? To make memorable places where people want to be, build in faces. Mother Nature, after all, has preset what we most need to see and we all pay a price, <em>always</em>, when we ignore her intent!</p>

Since March 2020, my husband and I have co-parented and co-schooled our two elementary school age children (age 6 and 8) while working full-time from home. This has been an incredibly ambiguous problem to solve on multiple levels. Our children went from attending physical school, going to various afterschool lessons, participating in sports and social engagements to staring at a computer screen for hours a day on our dining room table.&nbsp;</p><p>Very little instruction from the school was provided, and I did not expect much, as this was not a situation I have ever heard of a school actually preparing for. So, after we could take a breath and gain our barings, we sat down together, discussed the situation at length and decided that we were going to have to take matters into our own hands. We tried to weed out the “doom and gloom” of the situation and funnel our “limited” focus on what positive outcomes we wanted for our children. We wondered, how can we use this rare crazy situation as a learning opportunity? How can we rethink what success looks like and feels like?</p><p>We decided that the Spring term was a wash, and that we were just going to have to give Spring term a “thank you” and send it on it’s way. Just let that shit go and move on… We evaluated our comfort level with sending the kids to the various Summer camps I had meticulously scheduled and decided we were not comfortable. So, with Summer 2020 cancelled we proceeded to start a mommy-daddy summer school to try to catch them up and gain some momentum into the next school year.</p><p>In the process we have converted a big storage room into the family office where all four of us do our daily work. We did this on purpose, so that we could both work, and triage helping both our children. So if I cannot help, then my husband can and vice versa. Needless to say, there have been some funny conference call situations between all four of us. To help mitigate this situation we ended up creating some break out satellite spaces for when people know they are going to have a long back-and-forth conference session. We both happen to be loud conference call people, and it just does not work to have us both talking at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout this whole summer we have iterated on the schedule and have finally found one which works perfectly for our work situation and our children. We have had many, many family meetings about what we think is working and what isn’t. This was the summer of family problem solving. I am grateful for this process and for the rare opportunity I had to do this with my husband and children. Through this process I have been able to better understand directly where my children are at in a way I would have not have known if they had gone to Summer camp or had been in regular school. My children have also had a rare look into our work, what applications we use, and how we communicate with our co-workers. Because of this exposure, we have been able to have on-the-fly conversations about how what they are learning now will apply to the work they could do in the future. For instance, I was able to help my 8-year-old son with fractions while showing him how I use percentages to tell a data story in my company PowerPoints. When was I ever going to be able to make that connection for him while I was physically in the office, and he was physically in school? From these realizations we started really questioning the possibilities around how “overscheduled” our kids — and we — are.&nbsp;</p><p>School is about to start again, which will cause us to have to reiterate and disrupt our flow once again. Right now, I only have more questions and concerns than answers. For this, I have forgiven myself and decided that this is where I am supposed to be in this moment in time. I know we are all worried about our children, I am choosing to regard the chaos as “very good news” which will bring about new opportunities and changes applicable to our new reality going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>This is just my family’s story, and everyone’s is different. Read on to see how this pandemic has impacted other members of the PDXWIT community. </p></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599261534877_82522"><div><h2><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keralataylor/" target="_blank">Kerala Taylor</a>, Senior Strategist/UX Architect and Marketer at PixelSpoke</h2><p>When COVID first shut down our daughter’s elementary school and our son’s preschool, my husband and I considered ourselves among the lucky ones. He was furloughed for six weeks, able to get on unemployment, and available to provide care to our eight- and four-year-old while I worked full-time from home. Then in May, he returned to work outside the home and our lives became more complicated. We both reduced our schedules to 30-32 hours per week, but even still, juggling caregiving, homeschooling, and work responsibilities has proven to be unsustainable and exhausting. As we face the reality of virtual school in the fall, we are trying to figure out whether it’s even worth enrolling our now five-year-old in online kindergarten, and like every other working family, scrambling to figure out a viable way forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My husband and I are the only employees in our respective workplaces who are working reduced schedules (we are also the only employees who rely on dual incomes and have multiple children) and we both worry that this could be hampering our opportunities for career advancement. I’ve been incredibly distressed to see that working mothers in particular are leaving the workforce and reducing hours at far higher rates than working fathers, and I can’t even imagine the strain that the pandemic has placed on single-parent families.</p><p>Finding accessible, affordable, high-quality childcare was hard enough before COVID hit. The pandemic has only increased the burden on working families and wrought havoc on an already fragile child care infrastructure. Despite the fact that many employers are waking up to the fact that childcare is an essential service, government and business leaders are doing very little to offer support for, or even acknowledge the needs of, parents who are attempting to simultaneously work, homeschool, and provide care. </p></div></div></div><div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599261534877_78560"><div>

However, on March 25th, after having worked at home for a week, I was laid off in a very abrupt and unexpected way. The following week, my son’s daycare closed down. The week after that, my daughter’s school began remote learning. The result was challenges that I’m sure a lot of parents faced — how to homeschool your children while also taking care of other children. Several miscommunications from the school aside, we managed to make it work.</p><p>However optimistic I tried to be, I couldn’t ignore other facts that were surfacing in our lives — my husband’s job was at stake (luckily his union made a case and he was able to keep his regular hours, even though “regular” meant 32 hours, not 40, as an hourly employee), family and friends began to distance themselves, and my unemployment took two months to process. Not only that, there were everyday challenges of maintaining a household with two young children. It has not been easy.</p><p>Five months later, I am still unemployed, but have begun to brush up on certain skills and even learned some new ones and have begun volunteering to (virtually) meet new people and develop my network.

He is the co-author of “<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/exit-to-community">Exit to Community: A Community Primer</a>” and author of“Everything for Everyone: The Radical Tradition That Is Shaping the Next Economy.”</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you remember the time, in the fall of 2016, when rumors swirled that Twitter might be up for sale. As a reporter, I’d come to depend on Twitter. I first started using it heavily during the Arab Spring in 2011, enabling me to follow events on the ground in real-time and connect with activists directly. It felt shocking to me that this tool, which had become so important to my work and my life, was also a commodity. The news reports said maybe Disney or Google would buy it, or maybe Salesforce. This all seemed so arbitrary.</p>



<p>With some nudging from friends, I wrote an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/29/save-twitter-buy-platform-shared-ownership">article</a> in the Guardian suggesting Twitter should be owned by its users instead. What if that mere feeling that I had of ownership, as a participant in the Twitter-verse, was actually expressed in how the company was owned? I’ve written a lot of articles over the years that propose fantastical ideas; usually, they just plunk in the water. But this time, people around the world actually started organizing. I wasn’t the only person who felt this way. And we had a head start: Many of us had already been working together under the banner of “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40575728/worker-owned-co-ops-are-coming-for-the-digital-gig-economy">platform cooperativism</a>,” trying to graft the lessons of old worker-owned factories and member-owned credit unions into the online economy.</p>



<p>First, we circulated a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/twitter-inc-vote-yes-to-a-co-op-with-your-users">petition campaign</a>, asking Twitter to consider user ownership. Then we realized we had shares of Twitter stock in our community, and we could use those to make a shareholder proposal to the company itself. We had a bit of a legal battle with the company, which tried to strike down our proposal through the American Securities and Exchange Commission. But we won, and the proposal went forward. At the annual meeting in early 2017, we won nearly 5% of the vote — which doesn’t sound like a lot, but it was more than we expected, and it meant we could resubmit later. We also got a lot of attention: articles covered us in <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/lets-build-next-twitter-like-green-bay-packers/">Wired</a>, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/twitter-users-petition-co-op-shareholder-meeting">Vanity Fair</a> and about a <a href="https://www.buytwitter.org/press/">hundred other places</a>. The press thought what we were doing was crazy enough to be interesting. And then life went on.</p>



<p>Or did it? Something weird keeps happening. Those of us working on platform cooperativism have tended to think of ourselves as radicals working against Big Tech. So it came as a surprise to me when, in 2018 and 2019, several of the biggest, baddest tech companies began filing letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking it to allow them to share ownership with their users — to distribute company stock among the very user-workers the platforms refused to classify as employees. </p>



<p>These platforms included the likes of Airbnb and Uber. Like Twitter, these are multi-sided marketplaces that leverage user loyalty to entice fickle investor-owners. Their demand was a modest step, to say the least, yet it looked eerily like a step in the direction of the radicalism we had been calling for — building democracy into the businesses themselves, into how they are owned and governed. The Airbnb letter even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/business/dealbook/airbnb-hosts-shareholders.html">articulated</a> a lot of the rationales that we had been harping on in our little radical world for a few years.</p>



<p>The companies, of course, had their own interests at heart — several seemed to think it might buttress going public on Wall Street — but the letters made me wonder if a deal could be struck. At a time when regulators are starting to clamp down on the big platform companies, what if we could meet the companies in the middle and create a new kind of paradigm, a kind of race to the top? What if companies competed with each other not to extract more data from their users or suppress working conditions, wiping away rights that people have fought for over generations, but instead to offer better deals through shared ownership? </p>



<p>For the same reasons that startups often share stock with early employees, the platforms would get economic alignment with their users and loyalty. Society as a whole would get more built-in accountability for our platforms, a kind of accountability that doesn’t rely on any one jurisdiction or legislature. What if, in turn, we had a new kind of story available to tech startups, a new mythology?</p>

<h5><strong>Another Narrative</strong></h5>



<p>If you’re forming a startup, there are generally two kinds of stories to choose from about what the startup is for. Keep in mind that startups are companies that are trying to take over some subsection of the world. It’s ambitious stuff, so they tend to take on lots of early investment. They get somebody to give them a lot of money so they can hit the market with disproportionate force. And in order to pay that investment back, they need what’s called an “exit,” which usually comes in two forms: You’re either acquired by a larger company or you go public, selling your company on a market where people can trade your shares based on their speculations about what it’s worth. In both cases, you’re passing the company that you’ve worked to build off to new owners, who in turn might be buying it just to convince future buyers to pay even more for it later. It’s a weirdly normal pyramid scheme of capitalism.</p>



<p>What if there were another way? What if a startup that successfully builds a community could opt for an exit to ownership by that community?</p>



<p>This is not so crazy. The more I look, the more I find activists, lawyers, investors and entrepreneurs around the world who are exploring options along these lines, often while seeking to address some of the deep problems of internet culture. Community ownership could be a way of rooting out the abuses that we often see with the billion-dollar “unicorn” startups that make it big and lose their souls to satisfy financial markets, building accountability into the structure of the companies themselves. Too often, tech platforms get caught in the position of trying to extract as much as they possibly can from their users on behalf of their investor-owners, getting away with as much as they think they can.</p>

<p>There’s also a category in the Silicon Valley lexicon called “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/drew-houston-dropbox-startup-advice-2018-12">zombies</a>” — the companies that don’t quite become unicorns but aren’t failures either. They’re a dead weight on the investors’ balance sheets because, for one reason or another, nobody wants to buy them. Even if a company like that is making a profit and pleasing users, it can be worthless in the eyes of financial markets if it isn’t poised for the kind of exit options that investors need. What if the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/medlab/exit-to-community">exit to community</a> strategy could enable these zombies to be cured of their condition?</p>



<p>I have been working with Morshed Mannan, a legal scholar at the Leiden Law School, to sketch out <a href="https://ntnsndr.in/E2C-strategies">different strategies</a> for this based on what has been done before and what seems at least approximately plausible. Allow me to introduce you to our imaginary company, CoSocial. It’s a social network that managed to sprout a gig marketplace and payment system. It’s more or less a combination of Reddit and TaskRabbit — or, if you’re familiar with the Chinese online ecosystem, just think WeChat.</p>



<p>CoSocial has positioned itself as an upstart alternative to the big platform giants. It has taken a small, energetic slice of the market share, especially among people who want to opt out from the giants. Fees from marketplace payments have even made it at least mildly profitable. But its growth has stalled. Every pathway toward unicorn status seems to point in a direction that would drive away its most loyal users — incentivizing clickbait, adopting dismal labor standards — which puts the whole enterprise at risk. The founders and early investors are at a loss about what to do until they started thinking about their user community itself as the answer, and they come up with three ideas for how to proceed.</p>



<h5><strong>Option 1: Trust Buyout</strong></h5>



<p>The first is for users to buy out the investors. But let’s be reasonable: Even the most loyal users probably wouldn’t have the means or inclination to pony up cash to buy the company. Instead, CoSocial could follow the pattern of the U.S. employee stock ownership plan, in which a trust operating on the employees’ behalf borrows money to buy shares in the company — except in this case, on behalf of users. </p>



<p>At first, commercial banks might be reluctant to participate in the deal, but if a foundation committed a significant portion of mission-related investment funds, for instance, other institutions might join in. Within a few years, CoSocial’s profits would pay off the loan and the users’ trust would become able to keep and distribute the dividends. At first, the company would appoint an initial trustee for the trust, but within five years, the position would be elected by user-members.</p>



<p>This kind of shared pool could take a few forms. For instance, CoSocial’s gig workers might want to supplement their incomes with a proportional cut of the profits on a regular basis. But that benefit might be less important for users primarily interested in the social media features; their contribution to the profits might be much smaller when divided among individuals, but significant when pooled. </p>



<p>In that case, perhaps the dividends derived from their use could become a user-controlled fund for developing features or other initiatives that users choose through a participatory budgeting process. Those funds could also be used to support an independent oversight board — a user-accountable version of the one …</p></div></div>

So it is not inconsistent, nor suprising for someone to believe a candidate has 71% chance of success and they still lose. Even when looking at typical p-values, we wait for 95% percent certainty before making claims (and many feel this is a pretty weak belief). But for some reason whenever election polls come up, it seems even very statistically minded people suddenly think that 51% chance is a high probability.</p><p>I retweeted Nate Silver's forecast, mentioned my annoyance and provided an example of another case with a similar probability of winning:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-json="{&quot;cache_age&quot;:&quot;3153600000&quot;,&quot;authorUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:550,&quot;height&quot;:null,&quot;hSize&quot;:null,&quot;resolveObject&quot;:&quot;Tweet&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<blockquote class=\&quot;twitter-tweet\&quot;><p dir=\&quot;ltr\&quot; lang=\&quot;en\&quot;>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. <br><br>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:<br><br>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials<br><br>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href=\&quot;https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao\&quot;>https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p>\u2014 Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href=\&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\&quot;>August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n<script async=\&quot;\&quot; src=\&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\&quot; charset=\&quot;utf-8\&quot;></script>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Will Kurt&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;Twitter&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;}" data-block-type="22" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_6372"><div><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>This time can we all remember that rarely in statistics would we judge P(H|D) = 0.71 as a strong belief in anything. </p><p>For comparison if in an A/B test we had these results:</p><p>A has 2 successes in 15 trials<br>B has 3 successes in 14 trials</p><p>This roughly how strong our belief in B is <a href="https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao">https://t.co/bB4PiB5Tao</a></p></div>— Will Kurt (@willkurt) <a href="https://twitter.com/willkurt/status/1293575032975884288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_12181"><div><div><p>This question is interesting because it asks two questions that don't necessarily have to be related:</p><p>- is there an easy way to solve this<br>- is there a non-"brute force" way solve this</p><p>Before moving on I want to mention that this little snippet of R involves a lot more abstraction then it seems at first glance. What we are really doing here is equalivant to using a Monte-Carlo simulation to integrate over the distribution of the difference between two Beta distributed random variables. After the next two sections it will be more clear that what's happening here is a surprisingly sophisticated operation that is, in my opinion, the easiest method of solving this problem as well as not truly a brute force solution.</p></div><h2><br>Analytic versus Easy</h2><div><p>When we see computational solutions to mathematical problems our first instinct is typically to feel that we are avoiding solving the problem <em>analytically.</em> An analytical solution is one that uses mathematical analysis to find a closed form solution.</p><p>A strivial example, suppose I wanted to find the value that minimized \(f(x) = (x+3)^2\)</p><p>In R I could brute force this by looking over a range of answers like this:</p></div></div></div><div data-block-type="23" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1597610689295_13626"><div><pre><span>f</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>-</span> <span>function</span>(<span>x</span>){

It's also a bit messy because if we had iterated by an incredment that didn't include -3 exactly (say by 0.031) we would not get the exact answer.</p><p>If we know some basic calculus we know that our minimum has to be where the derivative is at 0. We can very easily work out that</p><p>$$f'(x) = 2(x+3)$$<br>And that</p><p>$$2(x + 3) = 0 $$</p><p>When</p><p>$$ x = -3 $$</p><p>Knowning basic calculus this later solution becomes much easier. </p><p>But even with the calculus is part is hard, often solving it once makes future solutions much easier. Take for example if you wanted to find the maximum likelihood for a normal distribution with a mean of \(\mu\) and standard deviation of \(\sigma\)</p><p>To solve this we start with our PDF for the normal distribution \(\varphi\):</p><p>$$\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}$$</p><p>Now computing the derivative of this is not necessarily "easy" but it's certainly something we can do. All we really care about is when</p><p>$$\varphi'(x) = 0$$</p><p>Which we can find out happens when (computing the deriviative of course is left as an exercise for the reader):</p><p>$$\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}$$</p></div><div><p>This allows us to reallize the amazing fact that for any normal distribution we come across, we know that the maximum likelihood estimate is the sample is when \(x = \mu\)!</p><p>Even though our calculus might take us a bit of work, once this is done the problem of doing maximum likelihood estimation for any Normal distribution truly does become easy!</p></div><h3><br>Proposing an Analytic solution to our problem</h3><div><p>Let's revisit our original problem this time attempting to find an analytic solution. This is a very interesting case because arguably this is the simplest Bayesian hypothesis test you can imagine.</p><p>Recall that we have two random variable representing our beliefs in each test. These are distributed according the the posterior which we described earlier.</p><p>$$A \sim \text{Beta}(2+1, 13+1)$$<br>$$B \sim \text{Beta}(3+1,11+1)$$</p><p>Here is where I skipped some steps in reasoning. What we want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B &gt;A)$$</p></div><div><p>Which is not expressed in a particularly useful mathematical way. A better way to solve this is to consider this as the sum (or difference in this case) of two random variables. What we really want to know is:</p><p>$$P(B - A &gt; 0)$$</p><p>In order to solve this problem we can think of a new random variable \(X\) which is going to be the difference between B and A:</p><p>$$X = B - A$$</p><p>Finally we'll suppose we have a probability density function for \(X\) we'll call \(\text{pdf}_X\). If we know \(\text{pdf}_X\) our solution is pretty close, we just need to integrate between 0 and the max domain of this distribution:</p><p>$$P(B &gt; A) = P(B - A &gt; 0) = \int_{x=0}^{\text{max}}\text{pdf}_{X}(x)$$</p><p>Already this is starting to look a bit complicated, but there's one big problem ahead. Unlike Normally distributed random variables, we have no equivalent of the Normal sum theorem (we'll cover this in a bit) for Beta distributed random variables. </p><p>What does \(\text{pdf}_X\) look like? For starters we know it's not a Beta distribution itself. We can see this because we know the domain (or support) of this distribution is not \([0,1]\). Because they are Beta distributed, A and B can both take on values from 0 to 1, which means the maximum result of this difference is 1 but the minimum is -1. So whatever this distribution is, its domain is \([-1,1]\) meaning it cannot be a Beta distribution.</p><p>We can use various rules about sum of random variables to determine the mean and variance of this distribution, but without knowing the exact form of this distribution we are unable to solve the integral analytically. </p><p>Here we can see that even in this profoundly simple problem the analytical solution is frustratingly …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></article></section></div></div></div></div>

After a while, you glance over and notice someone standing further down the aisle. They are staring at you and holding a clipboard. You were so distracted with what was on your mind that day that you just now noticed them, but you are not really sure how long they have been there. Have they been watching you the whole time?</p><p>You bend down to pick something off the bottom shelf to look closer.&nbsp; As you do this, you look over and the person writes something down on the clipboard.&nbsp; You put the item back, glance over and again, they frantically write some more.&nbsp; You decide to move on to another aisle to escape their gaze.&nbsp; But they follow you, writing more as they go.</p><p>Being a little too creeped out by this person, you decide to leave the store and continue your shopping elsewhere. As you enter the next store, you look up there is that same person by the shopping carts. Again, looking at you and making more scribblings on their clipboard.&nbsp; It's like the Twilight Zone.&nbsp; You leave the store immediately to drive home, now sufficiently frazzled.</p><p>As you drive, you are consumed with the thought of this person following you. Who were they? Why were they following? What were they writing? How did they know where I was going?</p><p>As you calm down a bit, you peek in the rear-view mirror. You see this person is now sitting in the back seat of your car. Startled, you scream. You pull over, demand they get out of the car and hand over the clipboard. You see that they have written down your every action. Every store you visited, product you touched, every turn you made in your car, how long you stopped at each stop sign, the radio station you are listening to and which songs you sung along to.&nbsp;The clipboard contains a record of your every action and behavior throughout the day.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7164xzlN2MU/X1U96R6AWUI/AAAAAAAAAPY/AiYCQOUVCRgLauIxlohXtitNz5DpaSkWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/surveillance-camera-sign-400x289.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="289" data-original-width="400" height="148" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7164xzlN2MU/X1U96R6AWUI/AAAAAAAAAPY/AiYCQOUVCRgLauIxlohXtitNz5DpaSkWgCLcBGAsYHQ/w205-h148/surveillance-camera-sign-400x289.png" width="205"></a></p><p>How would you feel if something like that scenario happened to you in real life?&nbsp; Would you be tolerate someone recording your every move no matter where you went? Would you allow them to follow you around all day? Would you be happy if that person was selling your information to anyone and everyone willing to pay for it?</p><p>Besides the physical person and clipboard, that scenario is exactly what happens to you every day on the Internet and with most every web site you visit.&nbsp; The only difference is that the person with the clipboard is invisible (unless you know how to look). What nearly no one would tolerate in their physical life is being allowed to happen with their on-line life. Practically speaking, there is really no difference between these two scenarios nowadays.</p><p>There is a multi-billion dollar market in buying and selling your personal data and that of every other person on the planet. Most any web site you visit is participating in either writing on that clipboard, or buying the data it contains.</p><p>If I have a company with a web site, should I be allowed to</p><ul><li>track your every move;</li><li>share that data with anyone I please; or</li><li>combine that data with the data from all other companies?</li></ul><p>Not only do most web sites do this, it is currently deemed as the "right way" to run a web-based company.&nbsp; The industry acceptance practice dictates that you should not be entitled to any privacy. They all put "tracking pixels" on their site which enables them to see your every move. This is not limited to simple things like which web sites you visited, but can include recording every movement of your mouse, where you hover over, for how long and where you click.&nbsp; The most valuable asset for these companies is the log of all your personal actions.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LTdFwAmRZc8/X1U5fiI5dEI/AAAAAAAAAPM/-xlKiXTWaxIcct5zqUTO3Ekr-ZMc2e8NgCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/hidden-drive-sign-266x400.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="400" data-original-width="266" height="205" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LTdFwAmRZc8/X1U5fiI5dEI/AAAAAAAAAPM/-xlKiXTWaxIcct5zqUTO3Ekr-ZMc2e8NgCLcBGAsYHQ/w136-h205/hidden-drive-sign-266x400.png" width="136"></a></p><p>There is a well-known phrase:</p><blockquote><p><i>"If the product is free, then you are the product."</i></p></blockquote><p>This perfectly sums up what is going on with the "free" games that are out there.&nbsp; These are provided by companies that participate in this anti-privacy web culture.&nbsp; You give up your privacy, they sell your data and you get to play for free.&nbsp; What we like to say is that for these "free" games:</p><blockquote><p><i>"They are only free if you do not put any value on your privacy."</i></p></blockquote><p>Humans are flawed.&nbsp; We can be manipulated to do things that do not make sense, that we do not need to do or even that we do not want to do.

Change has to start somewhere, so maybe our efforts can contribute to this in some small way.</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cD0KlFAhNJY/X1U2M_5NS1I/AAAAAAAAAO4/fedNfE0lMzIlNixApee2vwH-DC7ZzjYlACLcBGAsYHQ/s630/paa-icon-3-630x630.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="630" data-original-width="630" height="164" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cD0KlFAhNJY/X1U2M_5NS1I/AAAAAAAAAO4/fedNfE0lMzIlNixApee2vwH-DC7ZzjYlACLcBGAsYHQ/w164-h164/paa-icon-3-630x630.png" width="164"></a></p><p>We charge a fee for our game because we think the honest way of doing business involves a fair exchange without any hidden costs (such as giving up your privacy).&nbsp; We aim to provide hours of entertainment, and we only hope for a very small fee in return.</p><p>A movie gives 2 hours of entertainment and costs $10. A cup of coffee costs nearly $3 and lasts less than a hour.&nbsp; Our game costs less than both of those and provides many, many more hours of entertainment.</p><p>We do not try to trick you into buying the game. We provide a demo version so you can understand whether it has any appeal to you, and then a generous free trial period that gives you access to the full game and all its features. Only then, once you know exactly what we have to offer, do we ask whether you feel it provides enough value to justify the cost.</p><p>We encourage you to try our game and support the idea that privacy-focused companies can succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Start with our free demo:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://platesacrossamerica.com/demo/puzzle?tracking_id=blog-012">Play the Free Demo Game</a></p></blockquote><p>Happy Travels!</p>

<p>Long-running operations. Everyone, at some point in their career, has to face a time-consuming task. And on many occasions you also need to know what’s the status and what’s going on right now. Did it fail? Did it complete successfully? </p>



<p>Today we’re going to see a simple way to execute a long-running operation and keep track of the status using <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878&amp;tabs=csharp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Durable Entities</a>.</strong></p>



<p>I feel I’m in some kind of “writing spree” these days. I have 3 other Series still to complete (<a href="https://www.davideguida.com/blazor-and-2d-game-development-part-1-intro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blazor Gamedev</a>, <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/event-sourcing-on-azure-part-1-architecture-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Event Sourcing on Azure</a>, and <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/testing-azure-functions-on-azure-devops-part-1-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azure Function Testing</a>), but still, I feel the urge of writing about a different topic. Feels like I’m afraid of losing that thought if I don’t put it “into stone” here on this blog. I’m sure many of you can relate. </p>



<p>And the same happens when I’m working. Although, funnily enough, I spend quite some time wandering through the house, doing <em>apparently</em> nothing. It’s quite hard to explain to my wife that in those moments I’m trying to get rid of the <em>writer’s block</em> and find the right solution for a problem I’m facing. </p>



<h4>Coding, as usual, it’s always the last thing, the least important. It’s the byproduct of an ardent, fervent process of creation and design.</h4>



<p>Anyways, let’s get back on track! Long-running operations. By definition, they <em>take time.</em> A lot. This of course means that we can’t execute them during an HTTP request, or directly from a UI input. The system will timeout, as well as the user’s patience.</p>



<p>What we can do instead is offload that computation to the background. But still, we need a way to communicate the status to the caller (or any other interested party). For that we have basically two options:</p>



<ol><li><em><strong>polling</strong></em>.  By exposing a GET endpoint, everyone can poke the system and get the status. Nice, but not very efficient: lots of time and unnecessary HTTP requests wasted. It’s like when you’re working on something very complex and someone is constantly asking you “are we done?”. You’ll also lose time answering.</li><li><em><strong>pub/sub</strong></em>. Paradigm shift: clients won’t ping the system anymore, but will get informed <em>directly<strong> </strong></em>by it when the work is done. <br>“Are we done?” “We’re done when I tell you we’re done”.</li></ol>



<p>Nothing prevents us to implement both the options, it’s just a matter of taste.</p>



<p>For the actual execution instead, we can make use of <strong>Azure Durable Entities.</strong> They’ll do the job for us, and at the same time keep track of what’s going on. We talked about <strong>Durable Entities</strong> already <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/how-to-use-azure-durable-entities-to-see-whos-the-strongest-avenger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in another post</a>, so I’m not going to introduce them again. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png?ssl=1"><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="392" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png?resize=752%2C392&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png?resize=1024%2C534&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png?resize=768%2C401&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image.png?w=1142&amp;ssl=1 1142w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>Let’s start from left to right. We have 2 HTTP endpoints: <em>POST-ing</em> to <em>/processes</em> will put a message on a queue and return a 202 straight away. It will also generate an id and set the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/common-http-request-and-response-headers-used-in-azure-search?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Location header</a> pointing to the second endpoint. </p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[FunctionName("RequestProcess")]
public static async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; RequestProcess(
	[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "post", Route = "/processes")] HttpRequest req,
	[Queue(QueueName, Connection = QueueConnectionName)] CloudQueue encryptionRequestsQueue)
{
	var command = new StartOperation(Guid.NewGuid());

	var jsonMessage = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(command);
	await encryptionRequestsQueue.AddMessageAsync(new CloudQueueMessage(jsonMessage));

	return new AcceptedObjectResult($"processes/{command.RequestId}", command);
}</pre>



<p>The GET endpoint will return a 200 or a 202 if the system is still processing the operation. We might also decide to return a different status in case of error, it’s up to you. </p>



<p>Now the juicy part: the message on the queue will inform the system that it’s time to roll up the sleeves and do some real work:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[FunctionName("RunProcess")]
public static async Task RunProcess([QueueTrigger(QueueName, Connection = QueueConnectionName)] string message,
	[DurableClient] IDurableEntityClient client)
{
	var command = Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;StartOperation&gt;(message);
	var entityId = new EntityId(nameof(LongRunningProcessOrchestrator), command.RequestId.ToString());
	await client.SignalEntityAsync&lt;ILongRunningProcessOrchestrator&gt;(entityId, e =&gt; e.Start(command));
}</pre>



<p>The code is pretty straightforward: it deserializes the command from the message and spins up an <em>Orchestrator Entity</em>. This one will serve two purposes: spinning up a <em>Runner Entity</em> and keeping track of the state. </p>



<h4>We can’t run the process directly in the orchestrator, otherwise the system won’t be able to properly store the current state. </h4>



<p>Better offload (again, yes) the work to someone else:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void Start(StartOperation command)
{
	this.Id = command.RequestId;
	this.Status = ProcessStatus.Started;

	var runnerId = new EntityId(nameof(LongRunningProcessRunner), command.RequestId.ToString());
	_context.SignalEntity&lt;ILongRunningProcessRunner&gt;(runnerId, r =&gt; r.RunAsync(command));
}</pre>



<p>Moreover, this way we can have different types of<em> Runner Entities</em> and trigger one or another based on the input command.</p>



<p>Once triggered, the <em>Runner</em> will do whatever it’s meant to do and then call back the Orchestrator. It might also pass some details about the result of the operation, if needed:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public async Task RunAsync(StartOperation command)
{
        // do something very very time-consuming
	var orchestratorId = new EntityId(nameof(LongRunningProcessOrchestrator), command.RequestId.ToString());
	_context.SignalEntity&lt;ILongRunningProcessOrchestrator&gt;(orchestratorId, r =&gt; r.OnCompleted());
}</pre>



<p>And here’s the final part: in the <em>OnCompleted()</em> method, the Orchestrator will update its state and finally go to rest:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void OnCompleted()
{
	Status = ProcessStatus.Completed;	
}</pre>



<p>This is also the place where you might want to send the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878#topics-and-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integration event </a>to the subscribers, informing them the work is completed (maybe).</p>



<p>The code for a working sample <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/AzureLongRunningProcess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is available on GitHub</a> as usual, let me know what you think. À la prochaine!</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>
<h2>Accompanying Video</h2>
<p>This is an important topic. To ensure that we can cover those who like to read/ skim and those who like to get information via audio, we have an accompanying video:</p>
<p><iframe title="Vendor Locking AMD EPYC CPUs Great for Security at a Cost" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNVuTAVYxpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Feel free to pop open that video on YouTube and check it out or to send to those who prefer not to read.</p>
<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46531"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-internal-view-nodes-partially-out/" rel="attachment wp-att-46531"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out.jpg" alt="Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 Internal View Nodes Partially Out" width="800" height="519" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out-400x260.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out-696x452.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out-647x420.jpg 647w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46531">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 Internal View Nodes Partially Out</figcaption></figure>
<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors like HPE, Dell, and Lenovo have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>

<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

<p>Open letter to DY Logunov et al., authors of:</p>



<p><strong>“Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia.” Lancet. 2020;0(0). doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31866-3</strong></p>



<p>Available at:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>and to Richard Horton (editor of The Lancet).</p>



<p>OBJECT.</p>



<p>The study reports the results of a phase 1/2 study on an adenovirus-based vaccine, using Ad5 and Ad26 vectors for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as antigen, and two different formulations (liquid and lyophilized).</p>



<p>During the current pandemic, the extreme public interest and expectations for an effective vaccine are understandable. However, the very same reasons should motivate the scientific community to pay even more attention to the scientific evidence and the underlying data, and it is thus of utmost importance that they are fully available for close scrutiny. Numerical data for all the experiments and original FACS files in fcs format, for example, would be of great help in evaluating the present study, enabling direct reproduction of &nbsp;all analyses and findings, rather than trying to do so from data abstracted or inferred from the figures.<br>While the research described in this study is potentially significant, the presentation of the data raises several concerns which require access to the original data to fully investigate. These are detailed below.</p>



<p>POTENTIAL DATA INCONSISTENCIES IN FIGURES 2, 3 AND 4.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>figure 2</strong>, the authors report the reciprocal titre of RBD IgG and neutralizing antibodies at different time points, for all the patient groups (challenged with different formulations).<br>As evident by the following reproduction, there are several data patterns which appear repeatedly for the reported experiments. To this end, connecting measurements for each individual across time points would be highly beneficial in reporting (and hence) interpreting the results. This suggestion also applies to similar measurements in the other manuscript figures.</p>

<p><br>In the red boxes, 9 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd26-S appear to have identical antibody titres at 21 and 28 days; this is also true for 7 out of 9 volunteers challenged with rAd5-S (yellow boxes). Furthermore, in the cyan boxes we can see all the experimental points differing for a constant value in two completely unrelated experiments; and 8 out of 9 experimental points are completely preserved among other two completely unrelated volunteer groups (green boxes).</p>



<p>While we understand that in this case the variable under study is discrete (representing the reciprocal of a dilution), still it seems to us that on the ground of simple probabilistic evaluations the fact of observing so many data points preserved among different experiments is highly unlikely.</p>



<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 3</strong>, intended to present the results of the cellular response to the different formulations used for challenging the volunteers, in the following reproduction repeated experimental point patterns are boxed with the same colours as in the previous case, with an important difference: in this case, the variable under study (cell proliferation %) is continuous in nature, rendering the coincidence of data points among different experiments even less likely.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;<strong>figure 4</strong>, which is intended to show the neutralizing antibody formation against the adenovirus vectors used for the vaccine, problems like those observed for figure 2 are again apparent. The coloured boxes in the following reproduction are to be intended as in the previous cases.</p>

<p>Please note that, in lack of the original numerical data, no conclusions can be definitively drawn on the reliability of the data presented, especially regarding the apparent duplications detected.</p>



<p>FURTHER CONCERNS.</p>



<p>The authors did not specify enough characteristics of the convalescent patients used as a control for the evaluation of the humoral response in figure 2. How were they matched to the different groups of enrolled volunteers? Since there are several convalescent control patients which apparently are seronegative and are also negative for neutralizing antibodies, it is also crucial to know when their plasma was collected – for each patient, how many days passed since symptoms and seronegativization occurred? How many convalescent controls were used for the graphs in figure 2?</p>

            <p>
	Disney has publicly thanked a Chinese government agency accused of human rights abuses in Xinjiang for its help in making "Mulan" — a revelation that has provoked a storm of criticism online.</p>
<p>
	Disney acknowledges several Chinese government bodies in the credits for the live-action remake of the 1998 animated picture of the same name, but a few in particular have raised red flags: The Xinjiang government's publicity department and the Public Security and Tourism bureaus for Turpan, a city of about <a href="http://www.tlf.gov.cn/zjtluf/rkyy/rkgk.htm" target="_blank">633,400 people</a> just outside Xinjiang's capital Urumqi.</p>
<p>
	Disney did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business to its media inquiry line, and to U.S. press officers about the film and the credits. It's not clear how much of "Mulan" may have been shot in Xinjiang, though people who worked on the movie have said on social media and in interviews that they scouted and filmed locations there.</p>
<p>
	The U.S. State Department estimates that since 2015 as many as <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/120418_Busby_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">two million of the Muslim-majority Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities</a> have been imprisoned in enormous re-education camps in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>
	The Turpan Public Security Bureau has been listed by the U.S. government as an organization involved in <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/10/09/2019-22210/addition-of-certain-entities-to-the-entity-list" target="_blank">"human rights violations and abuses"</a> in the region.</p>
<p>
	Beijing has long defended the crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism, and said it is in line with Chinese law and international practice, calling accusations of mass detentions a "groundless lie" and "sensational rumor." A spokesperson for the country's foreign ministry on Tuesday reiterated its defense of what it calls its Xinjiang "vocational skills education and training centers." CNN Business has reached out to the Xinjiang government and Turpan's tourism bureau, but Turpan's Public Security bureau could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>
	"There are no so-called concentration camps in Xinjiang," said China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. "The establishment of vocational skills education and training centers in Xinjiang in accordance with the law is a useful attempt and active exploration for preventive counter-terrorism and de-radicalization."</p>
<p>
	But the connections between Xinjiang and "Mulan" have ignited widespread criticism on social media since its release Friday on Disney+, the company's streaming service. Human rights advocates are now calling on Disney to make public any agreements with the Chinese government over filming in the region.</p>
<p>
	"[It's] deeply disturbing that Disney thought it was okay to partner with, and also thank, government departments, specifically propaganda departments, and a public security bureau from a region in China that is<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank"> complicit with genocide," </a>said Isaac Stone Fish, senior fellow at the Asia Society, a New York based non-profit organization focused on raising awareness of Asia.</p>
<h3>
	A FILM PLAGUED BY SETBACKS</h3>
<p>
	Disney hoped that "Mulan" would be a major success at the lucrative Chinese box office, now the second-largest in the world. The company spoke last year about its dedication to making the film culturally accurate — remarks that were reported in Chinese state media.</p>
<p>
	"We spent a lot of time in the beginning with scholars, experts and people from the region. And we spent a great deal of time in China," said Sean Bailey, president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, at a Disney expo event last year, reported the state-run news agency Xinhua. Bailey added that the studio "not only has a Chinese cast but also brought in a Chinese producer to make the movie with them," the outlet noted.</p>
<p>
	Eschewing the musicality of Disney's earlier animated feature of the same name, one box office analyst told CNN Business earlier this year that the live-action epic was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/media/disney-mulan-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">"tailor-made for success."</a></p>
<p>
	But the film — which is based on a traditional Chinese legend about <a href="http://www.womenofchina.cn/womenofchina/html1/history/1706/4656-1.htm" target="_blank">a female warrior</a> who disguised herself as a man and took her father's place in the army — has already faced controversy and setbacks.</p>
<p>
	In August 2019, pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong called for a boycott of "Mulan" after the lead actor expressed support for Hong Kong police on her social media account.</p>
<p>
	"I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now. What a shame for Hong Kong," Liu Yifei, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen who plays the titular Hua Mulan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/16/asia/china-mulan-actor-protests-intl-hnk-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">posted to her official Weibo account.</a> At the time, Hong Kong police faced allegations of excessive violence against protesters. (Hong Kong police <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/20/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">defended their actions</a> in September 2019, saying they had been "so restrained.")</p>
<p>
	Then in March, Disney was forced to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/media/mulan-delay-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">delay the film's release</a> as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered movie theaters.</p>
<p>
	Even now, its rollout has been stilted. The film was released as a US$30 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/media/mulan-disney-china-international-release/index.html" target="_blank">video-on-demand </a>last Friday on Disney+, which is only available in certain markets, including the United States. It makes its debut in Chinese theaters this weekend. (Disney+ is not available in China.)</p>
<p>
	The release of the film has renewed the controversy surrounding it, however. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/04/entertainment/mulan-boycott-hong-kong-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Thailand and Taiwan</a> have once again called on people to boycott the film because of Yifei's remarks last year.</p>
<p>
	And it's not even clear that the film will win over Chinese audiences, who were already chilly toward the original animated version because of its westernized flair and unfaithful retelling of the original legend.</p>
<p>
	After the release of the trailer in 2019, Chinese state-run media Global Times criticized the film for using<a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1157286.shtml" target="_blank"> Japanese "ninja gestures"</a> and Chinese stereotypes.</p>
<h3>
	CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY</h3>
<p>
	Allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang stretch back years.</p>
<p>
	In recent years, the Xinjiang government has allegedly undertaken a large campaign to imprison and re-educate Muslim minorities in the region, especially the large Uyghur population.</p>
<p>
	Evidence of widespread human rights abuse has trickled out from inside the region, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/" target="_blank">lengthy detentions,</a> abuse, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/asia/china-xinjiang-leaks-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">indoctrination</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/asia/xinjiang-sterilization-women-human-rights-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">mass birth control</a> — which experts have described as evidence of "genocide."</p>
<p>
	In 2017, Mulan director Niki Caro posted a photo from Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang<strong> </strong>and said she was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZle-neFOc-/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank">scouting out locations</a> for the film. And in an interview in September<strong> </strong>with Conde Nast traveler, Mulan production designer Grant Major discussed filming in Xinjiang's <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/on-location-mulan" target="_blank">Taklamakan Desert</a>, in the region's far southwest.</p>
<p>
	Adrian Zenz, a leading academic<strong> </strong>at the Victims of Communism Foundation who has helped break major stories from Xinjiang, said that the earliest documented case of a re-education center in the region was in Turpan in 2013.</p>
<p>
	Zenz said that while it was possible Disney didn't know about the growing number of detention centers set up across Xinjiang, the widespread oppression in the region was impossible to miss.</p>
<p>
	"There were police stations and checkpoints all over Xinjiang by late 2016, not to be missed," he said.</p>
<p>
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao dismissed Zenz's claims and accused him of making a living "through making Xinjiang-related rumors and slandering China." He also claimed there had been no cases of violence or terrorism in Xinjiang for "more than three consecutive years."</p>
<p>
	Turpan was also the setting for one of the worst outbreaks of ethnic violence in Xinjiang in recent years, when 35 people died during an attack on a police station in Lukqun township, in 2013, <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/kindle/2013-07/05/content_16731473.htm" target="_blank">according to state media.</a></p>
<p>
	Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, called for Disney to <a href="https://twitter.com/Yaqiu/status/1303002585155149825" target="_blank">disclose what assistance</a> it had received from Xinjiang authorities and what agreements it had made with the regional government.</p>
<p>
	And<strong> </strong>Asia Society fellow Stone Fish said that many companies were accustomed to making small concessions to the ruling Communist Party to access the Chinese market.</p>
<p>
	"Studios feel like they need to make these compromises to be in Beijing, but you can slightly censor your movies to get into the Chinese market, you can bring Chinese movies that shouldn't be in the States because of poor quality or because of propaganda elements into the States. And you can do that and maintain your integrity, mostly intact," he said.</p>
<p>
	"You don't need to take these extra steps that Disney is taking, and they're rightly getting excoriated for it."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Should you join a big company or start a startup?</p>
<p>This frequently debated question paints a picture of a world where the only choice is between being a cog at a giant semi-monopoly, or taking investment money in the hopes of one day growing to be head cog at a giant semi-monopoly.</p>
<p>Role models matter. So I made a list of small companies that I admire. Neither giants nor startups - just people making a living writing software on their own terms.</p>
<h2 id="sqlite"><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">sqlite</a></h2>
<p>Sqlite is an existence proof that you don't need a thousand engineers to have an impact. It's been around since the early 90s, is one of the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">most shipped</a> pieces of software in existence and is widely respected for its <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">exceptional testing methodology</a>. Yet it was written almost entirely by a few people:</p>
<pre><span>jamie@machine:~/sqlite$ git shortlog -s -n | head -n 5
 14012	drh
  4297	dan
  1663	danielk1977
  1099	mistachkin
   175	shane
</span></pre>
<p>Their growth plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hwaci is a small company but it is also closely held and debt-free and has low fixed costs, which means that it is largely immune to buy-outs, take-overs, and market down-turns. Hwaci intends to continue operating in its current form, and at roughly its current size until at least the year 2050. We expect to be here when you need us, even if that need is many years in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sqlite is also interesting because although the code is open source they operate on a cathedral model, generally <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html">refusing or rewriting</a> outside contributions.</p>
<h2 id="pinboard"><a href="https://pinboard.in/">pinboard</a></h2>
<p>Pinboard is a single-person operation that has been making a solid income year on year <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2019/07/i_cant_stop_winning/">since 2010</a>. It somehow still leaves Maciej enough free time to go around <a href="https://idlewords.com/2019/5/">teaching politicians how to not get hacked</a> and <a href="https://idlewords.com/talks/senate_testimony.2019.5.htm">explaining privacy to the senate</a>. All the while <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2017/06/pinboard_acquires_delicious/">destroying his competition</a> using highly advanced tactics such as <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/fan_is_a_tool_using_animal.htm">listening to his customers</a> and not operating at a loss.</p>
<p>But if Maciej had done nothing else he would still be on this list for his beautiful talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c">Barely Succeed! It's Easier!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a remarkable time when small teams (or even lone programmers) can successfully compete against internet giants. But while the last few years have seen an explosion of product ideas, there has been far less innovation in how to actually build a business. Silicon Valley is stuck in an outdated 'grow or die' mentality that overvalues risk, while investors dismiss sustainable, interesting projects for being too practical. So who needs investors anyway?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I'll talk about some alternative definitions of success that are more achievable (and more fun!) than the Silicon Valley casino. It turns out that staying small offers some surprising advantages, not just in the day-to-day experience of work, but in marketing and getting customers to love your project. Best of all, there's plenty more room at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If your goal is to do meaningful work you love, you may be much closer to realizing your dreams than you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tarsnap"><a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">tarsnap</a></h2>
<p>Another single-person operation, tarsnap has reported been profitable <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/about.html">since 2009</a> and shows no sign of going anywhere, even lowering it's prices over the years as storage became cheaper. It's saved me on multiple occasions and it's so simple, reliable and cheap that I think of it almost like a utility - tarsnap having an outage would be more surprising to me than water not coming out of my taps.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about tarsnap is that it could <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/">easily be making more money</a>. If tarsnap had investors or shareholders, they would have <strong>already forced Colin to do so</strong>. In other words, the only reason that Colin gets to continue running the kind of business that he <strong>wants</strong> to run is that he owns it entirely and noone can force him to maximize profit instead.</p>
<h2 id="sublime"><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">sublime</a></h2>
<p>Version 1.0 came out in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/one-point-oh">2008</a> and they're still going strong today, making enough to <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">hire an extra developer</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-merge">launch a separate product</a>.</p>
<p>Sublime is notable for surviving despite massive open-source competition in a field where people hate to pay for tools. As <a href="https://thume.ca/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/">Tristan Hume points out</a>, it's really the only editor that has managed to remain both fast and consistent while still supporting a large plugin ecosystem. These kind of end-to-end qualities are perhaps one of the main advantages for small teams with a long time horizon.</p>
<h2 id="zig"><a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a></h2>
<p>Zig has been around <a href="https://andrewkelley.me/post/full-time-zig.html">only a few years</a> but I'm already wildly impressed by the quality of thought and engineering that has gone into it.</p>
<p>The Zig Software Foundation is a non-profit, currently funded entirely by donations and working towards being able to employ a second full-time developer. They explicitly chose to be a non-profit out of concern over how profit incentives creep into daily decision making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In You Weren’t Meant to Have a Boss, Paul Graham makes an analogy between animals in the zoo (employees) and animals in the wild (startup founders). I think he’s on to something, but when you start a startup, you still have a boss. In fact, you have the same boss. At the end of the day, it is an inescapable fact that you must do what makes a profit, for the shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference in incentives makes a structural difference that permeates every part of an organization. Windows users wake up one day and find ads in their start menu. Will Debian Linux ever try to put ads into any of its software? The concept is absurd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zig was explicitly designed to be a <a href="https://ziglang.org/#Small-simple-language">small, simple language</a>, allowing it to be maintained indefinitely by a small, committed team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ZSF is a small organization and makes efficient use of monetary resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t see the need for ZSF to grow beyond a handful of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Maciej <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vt8zqhHe_c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2144">puts it</a>, one of the advantages of being small is that you can speak with a human voice. This comes across clearly from the zig team, who are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8f48iYKxgg">resolutely human</a> instead of projecting some impassive facade of professionalism.</p>

<![CDATA[An Australian Guide to Surfing with Sharks]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5c91da556e9a7f5043553708"><div><p>&nbsp;<strong>AN AUSTRALIAN GUIDE TO SURFING WITH SHARKS </strong></p><p><em>Written by Madison Stewart with the help of many amazing scientists, oceanographers and badass ocean goers. </em></p><p>I looked on the surf life saving website not too long ago, it contained warnings of jelly fish, rips and skin cancer... I saw no mention of sharks. It’s become apparent to me that we as a country have no desire to face the reality of the apex predators we share the ocean with until it is too late, and then we talk about them in media stories of fear and terror. In the absence of knowledge and education, how can we expect to co-exist with what is, in reality, a dangerous animal? No cull or net will ever keep us 100% safe on our vast coastline, we will never rid the oceans of sharks, we cannot choose whether or not we interact with sharks, we can however choose the terms on which those interactions occur. This is my small - and I feel much-needed guide - for the people and surfers of Australia who are on the front line of shark interactions daily. You are in situations more dangerous than people like myself who base their work around diving with sharks ever are. You deserve to be flooded with information that may help you, also take responsibility to ensure that when you enter the ocean it is with the most educated approach towards its dangers. Sharks exist in our waters, and it’s not only our job to co exist with them, it’s our privilege, and I truly hope this document helps you do that. I hope this sheds some light on the seemingly endless darkness inspired by the Australian media towards the true risk of a shark attack. According to the Australian Shark Attack File run by the Taronga Zoo, in the last 50 years there have been 47 unprovoked shark attack fatalities. The Royal Life Saving Society notes a 10 year average of 292 deaths per year for people drowning in Australia. There were 176 diving related deaths in Australia between 2002-2009, an average of 23 per year. Fatalities from shark attacks over the last 50 years average just under one per year (0.9). </p><p><strong>INDEX: </strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>AN ATTACK </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WHY DO SHARKS ATTACK HUMANS </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WHY SHARK NETS AND CULLS ARE NOT THE ANSWER </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SHARKS AND BLOOD </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SHARK AND YOU </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>HAVE SHARK POPULATIONS BOOMED? </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>SHARK MITIGATION DEVICES </strong></p><p><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT INCREASE SHARK PRESENCE: </strong></p><p>Bait balls<br> Rainfall &amp; River mouths<br> Drop offs &amp; deep water<br> Water temperature<br> Whale carcasses &amp; other animal remains Time of day<br> Moon phases </p><p><strong>INTRO </strong>Environmental factors that can affect a white shark’s ability to successfully detect and approach its prey have been researched. Focusing on 8-year period at Seal Island, South Africa, attacks on seals and success rates were noted. Attacks and attempts varied with changes in depth, natural light, time of day, time of year, wind direction and other factors. I once heard someone say there are no dangerous sharks, just dangerous situations, and the same can be true for many animals. There are environmental conditions that can often facilitate the success rate of a shark’s attack, making certain times and features of the environment favorable to sharks, and increase the danger. The following are examples. The reality is that you may avoid all the listed below and surf in crystal clear water at a perfect time on a perfect day and still become subject to a shark attack. Nothing is bullet proof, and taking that risk is something you need to be mentally prepared for before entering the water. </p></li></ul><p><strong>BAIT BALLS </strong>Bait balls are a common occurrence along our coastline here in Australia. When small fish swarm in a tightly packed formation it’s usually a defensive measure against predators and feeding frenzies are often trigged by bait balls. I shared an interesting conversation with a fisheries officer once that brought this to my attention. One of the theories for the frequent attacks that occurred in a short span of time in Ballina could be pinned to a single environmental anomaly allowing for masses of bait balls. In the year 2000 we saw the fish species the blue pilchard devastated by a foreign disease introduced into our domestic waters, the blue pilchard was not expected to bounce back from the collapse. The bait balls in Ballina at the time of the frequent shark attacks were made up of the blue pilchard. When a fish species bounces back from something like that they come in an unsustainable proportion, and will usually take time to dwindle down to the sustainable amount depending on predation and availability of food in their environment. So not only did we have bait balls, but an unusual amount of one particular species that was returning in great numbers, meaning the availability of food could have been responsible for the unusual number of sharks in the area, leading to the number of attacks. Flocks of diving sea birds are a good indicator that there is a bait ball offshore, and it is important to look for this and try to avoid surfing any patch of coast where this feeding action may be happening. Putting yourself into a bait ball is putting yourself into a feed frenzy where animals are moving fast and making snap judgments and are in the area to hunt. In addition to these signs be aware that contrary to popular belief large sharks are not deterred by dolphins. In fact dolphins and large sharks will often feed on the same fish and in some cases dolphins are potential food for large sharks. </p><p><strong>RAIN FALL AND RIVER MOUTHS </strong>These can be dangerous when surfing for a number of reasons. After rainfall, nutrients run into the ocean and bring up fish and other animals to feed, and this in turn brings in different species of sharks. In addition to this the visibility of the water after rainfall can greatly decrease, which is ideal for ambush predators like sharks to hunt in. One example of rainfall creating a dangerous situation was an attack in Ballina, where a man was surfing at 6:30pm near a river mouth after heavy rainfall and was attacked by a bull shark. The rainfall and visibility and also time of day were things that made it dangerous to surf. Bull sharks are the primary concern with rainfall. Being one of the few species that can travel into fresh water by increasing the level of urea in their system, as they mature, research found that bull sharks move down into the lower realms of rivers before migrating to the open ocean in their fifth or sixth year. Dr Jonathan Werry from the Ocean and Coast Research group says "They'll move into beach areas, they get flushed out (of rivers) because their normal distribution patterns rely on salinity levels, that's when you've seen attacks in Australia and around the world; a lot of them have to do with periods of rainfall. You seem them also go into holes within the canals and river systems to possibly get some refuge from strong flowing amounts of rain.” Big enough rainfall will change the normal distribution patterns of bull sharks within a river system and will move bulls out of a river system into a near shore beach area. River mouths also represent a food source for sharks with all run off flowing into the ocean from upriver, things like fertilizers and even sewage can cause fish to feed and congregate in the river mouth area. </p><p><strong>DROP OFFS AND DEEP WATER </strong>These are opportunities for sharks, and large sharks like to hunt near drop-offs, in-between sand banks and on the edge of kelp forests where they wait to surprise seals, fish or turtles swimming through. The reason great white sharks have a white belly but a darker coloration to the top of their body is so that they remain camouflaged with the ocean ground when looking down, and blend in with the sky when looking up from underneath. Seals and other large mammal prey are fast and can easily out maneuver great whites. This is why great whites attack in a way that has the element of surprise, using their habitat to their advantage. This is why locations where there is a vast amount of deep space underneath can be dangerous if a great white shark is hunting in the area. The depth allows them to complete the ambush foundation of their hunting. Even though sharks are capable of swimming in very shallow water, most shark activity is in deeper water. Shark Spotters in False Bay record over 70% of great white shark sightings behind the surf zone, in deeper water. </p><p><strong>WATER TEMPERATURE </strong>One example of this is northern NSW, winter is a time when whales are swimming up the coast with their new born babies, and Great Whites take this opportunity and follow the whales and prey on the sick, young and weak. University of Sydney lecturer Chris Neff said every deadly attack in WA had occurred in temperatures ranging between 18 and 20 degrees. “White sharks come in shore when the water surface temperature is about 18 degrees, and there hasn’t been an attack in WA when the temperature wasn’t 20 or below,”. Cold-water upwelling’s carrying nutrients and allowing great whites to push furthest inshore could be the sole factor for grouped shark attacks in WA. Great white sharks are a cold water species, and their bodies possess a counter current artery and vein system, which means a countercurrent blood flow exchanges heat, by mixing the cold blood from the arteries with the warm blood from the veins. Great White sharks can therefore elevate their body temperatures up to 14 degrees higher than the surrounding water. Increasingly warm waters around the globe due to climate change and El Niño can also effect sharks, it’s suggested to have led to the highest number of shark attacks ever recorded in 2015, this is due to greater interactions between humans and sharks in the water, and temperature changes allowing sharks to coexist in closer proximity to humans. </p><p><em>Research has predicated that the E.A.C will strengthen in the future with a changing climate. This will extend warm waters further south and change the tropical and subtropical environments and marine habitats, so you can expect to witness the change. Yes you will see more sharks<br> </em><strong><em>- Malia Rouïllon, Physical …</em></strong></p></div></div></div>

<section>

<p><em>This is the second of a 5-part series on AWS exploits and similar findings discovered over the course of 2020. All findings discussed in this series have been <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/">disclosed</a> to the AWS security team and had patches rolled out to all affected regions, where necessary. A big thanks to my friend and fellow Australian <a href="https://twitter.com/__steele">Aidan Steele</a> for co-authoring this series with me. This post was written by Aidan.</em></p>

<p>CodeBuild is a <em>fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy</em> according to the official product page. Unofficially, it’s just a great serverless way to run arbitrary Docker images and scripts if you ask <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1283823450683920385">@QuinnyPig</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/corey-tweets.png" alt=""></p>

<p>CodeBuild has a <strong>lot</strong> of configuration options to cater for just about every use case. One of those options is “privileged mode”, equivalent to the <code>--privileged</code> flag when executing <code>docker run</code>. It’s often said that a privileged container is essentially as good as no container at all, security-wise. Which brings us to an interesting question: can you break out of the CodeBuild container? Where will you end up?</p>

<h2 id="break-out">Break out</h2>

<p>So how should we break out? Lets start by looking at some of the things that privileged containers can do that regular containers can’t. One such action is the ability to mount devices. What devices are already mounted? This is (an excerpt of) the output from running <code>mount</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
...
cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio)
...
/dev/nvme0n1p1 on /codebuild/output type ext4 (rw,noatime,data=ordered)
/dev/nvme0n1p1 on /codebuild/readonly type ext4 (rw,noatime,data=ordered)
/dev/nvme0n1p1 on /codebuild/bootstrap type ext4 (ro,noatime,data=ordered)
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those are interesting! If we poke around in those <code>/codebuild</code> directories we can see what looks like the files needed by the CodeBuild agent itself running in the container. But they must have been mounted from the host. What other files are on the host? We can check by running <code>mkdir /host &amp;&amp; mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /host</code>.  Now lets take a look (again cutting the boring stuff):</p>

<div><div><pre><code># ls -l /host
total 156
dr-xr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Aug 13 21:07 bin
drwxr-xr-x 11 root root  4096 Aug 13 21:04 cgroup

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     370 Sep  2 01:45 ensureInstance.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       5 Sep  2 01:45 fe_socat.pid

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root    3202 Sep  2 01:45 provision.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     682 Sep  2 01:45 socat_script.sh
drwx------ 2 root root    4096 Sep  2 01:44 tmp.MOeHFIUJkF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The script in <code>/host/tmp/monitor.sh</code> isn’t super interesting in itself - it’s just putting some metrics in CloudWatch for use by the CodeBuild team. But it does look like it terminates, rather than running forever. So there must be something running it on a schedule. Maybe a crontab?</p>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/monitor-script.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So we go poking around and sure enough, <code>/host/etc/cron.d/buildfleetmetrics</code> runs that script every 5 minutes: <code>*/5 * * * * root /tmp/monitor.sh</code>. Do you know what that means?</p>

<h2 id="what-does-that-mean">What does that mean?</h2>

<p>That means we can edit <code>/host/tmp/monitor.sh</code>, wait up to 5 minutes and tada: we’re now running our own code on the underlying EC2 instance - I <strong>knew</strong> serverless had servers!</p>

<p>Here are a few observations that I made about the EC2 instance once I got the chance to poke around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s running in an AWS-owned account, shared across customers.</li>
  <li>A brand new instance is started for each build and terminated after the build ends.</li>
  <li>It is orchestrated by ECS, the AWS container orchestration service.</li>
  <li>It appears that CodeBuild has an ECS cluster per customer. The cluster name is the customer’s account ID.</li>
  <li>Renaming things is <strong>hard</strong>. It looks like maybe CodeBuild was once called CodeFactory and they still haven’t had a chance to rename their Docker images.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://onecloudplease.com/images/posts/inspect-container.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-bad-is-it">How bad is it?</h2>

<p>Given that I had free rein over an instance in an AWS-managed account, I thought two things: a) surely the CodeBuild team are aware of this possibility, but also b) I should probably report it <em>just in case</em>. So I reported it on June 5th and got the first response less than five hours later. I got another email on the 11th of June letting me know that they haven’t forgotten about me and will aim to get back to me soon. I got the final response on June 18th and it was quite informative! Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>Though Codebuild makes use of containers, the containers do not constitute a security boundary of the Codebuild service. As part of Codebuild's design, instances responsible for running customer jobs are isolated from those belonging to other customers. Security Groups are further used to isolate instances at the network level. The credentials you described are scoped appropriately to the instance where they were obtained and do not grant additional access beyond that instance.</blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I’m pretty happy with that response. I already trust the isolation between customers provided by EC2 and ECS and I don’t have any reason to doubt them with CodeBuild thrown into the mix. It was also nice to get that level of insight shared freely!</p>

<h2 id="closing-out">Closing out</h2>

<p>So that’s the story of the compromise that wasn’t. I thought I might have had something, but the clever folks over at AWS considered it as part of their design. And in the end I got what I wanted: a copy of the Docker images that CodeBuild use for their “curated environments”. They’ve provided the Dockerfiles for some time, but not the <em>layers</em> - and those are what I wanted for the reason in the following chart. I likely never would have gone on this escapade had they been available! But here we are and if you want them too, I put them on <a href="https://github.com/glassechidna/codebuild">GitHub</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>The conviction of two former London-based investment bankers in a German trial on 18 March has established Cum-Ex trading as a form of criminal tax evasion. But the end of this trial begins a new chapter for bankers that should be prompting financial institutions across Europe to consider their risk exposure. Anyone directly or indirectly involved in the borrowing and lending of European equities around dividend dates will be affected – including investment bank trading desks, inter-dealer brokers, settlement agents and custodian banks. What steps can you take to prepare your institution or client?</p><h2>As the long-running Cum-Ex banking scandal comes to a head in Germany, how should international financial institutions be bracing for impact?</h2>
<p>The Cum-Ex dividend trading scandal, which has been rumbling on throughout Europe for a number of years, sparked into life in March with the convictions of two former London-based investment bankers – Martin Shields and Nicholas Diable. These convictions mark the first occasion where Cum-Ex trading has been adjudicated to be criminal tax evasion. Notably, both defendants avoided immediate prison sentences in return for extensive cooperation with the prosecutors and the return of their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p>However, rather than this being the conclusion of a story, it is in fact just the start of what will likely become the unravelling of another banking scandal to rival or even eclipse the scale of Libor and FX rate manipulation.</p>
<p>Support for this view can be taken from the speech of Mark Steward the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight, which was delivered shortly before these convictions took place and signals both what the FCA’s first steps will be and the scale of the issue in London:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the FCA has worked closely with European authorities for some time on…dividend stripping tax avoidance schemes that have operated in Denmark, Germany, France and Italy. The FCA has been investigating substantial and suspected abusive share trading in London’s markets that has allegedly supported these schemes. These investigations are now very close to their conclusion and decisions about action are imminent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is striking about this statement, although not in the least bit surprising for those who understand the central part that the City of London plays in European financial markets, is the acknowledgment that whilst the tax evasion schemes themselves exploited the dividend withholding tax regimes of other EU countries, much of the structuring, trading, financing and promotion of it took place in the City of London.</p>
<p><strong>Recap on Cum-Ex</strong></p>
<p>In brief, Cum-Ex trading is a form of dividend arbitrage where trading and lending of securities and derivatives are constructed around dividend dates in order to generate multiple withholding tax (WHT) reclaims for the same stock. Cum-Ex trading became industrial in scale and resulted in huge WHT reclaims in Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Denmark and elsewhere. It is thought that at least €55 billion in wrongful WHT reclaims were made before tax regimes reacted to close the ‘loopholes’.</p>
<p><strong>Redrawing the Line between Evasion and Avoidance</strong></p>
<p>Dividend arbitrage – placing shares in alternative tax jurisdictions in order minimise tax exposure – has been accepted practice for a very long time and was, at least by the standards of the time, on the right side of the tax avoidance / evasion line. Cum-Ex trading and its close relative Cum-Cum trading were also, according to legal opinions given at the time, thought to be on the lawful side of the dividing line (although sailing pretty close to it). Those opinions have now been blown out of the water and the lawyers who gave them are themselves facing criminal investigations. In this way the line between tax avoidance and evasion in dividend arbitrage has been re-drawn and will continue to be so as more cases follow. Inevitably, as this progressive re-drawing develops, regulators and prosecutors will examine trading patterns, conduct and behaviour, not through the standards of the day, but through the lens of whatever the newly drawn lines are.</p>
<p><strong>Who will be affected?</strong></p>
<p>Financial institutions who have been directly or indirectly involved in activity relating to the borrowing and lending of European equities around dividend dates will be affected. This will include investment bank trading desks, inter-dealer brokers, settlement agents and custodian banks.</p>
<p><strong>What will the Regulators be looking at?</strong></p>
<p>Regulators will be looking at all facets of trade in equities around dividend dates, guided by the exchange of information and intelligence from EU counterparts, going back over many years to establish the extent to which firms were involved. They will be particularly interested in unusual trading patterns, trades with no apparent risk, off-market trades, trades with profitability out of line with the risk involved, the role of firms in promoting dividend arbitrage opportunities to clients, whether firms took care to understand the true nature and purpose of the transactions and whether there was adequate management oversight (such as via the Money Laundering Reporting Officer and whether suspicious activity reports were appropriately submitted).</p>
<p>The exposure to risk will range in severity from criminal investigations and penalties through to regulatory failings or failings in systems and controls. The nature and extent of the risk exposure will depend on the proximity to any instances of evasion or fraud, the degree of knowledge and whether ‘red flags’ in transactions were identified and managed.</p>
<p><strong>Key risk areas include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Criminal law offences</li>
<li>Compliance with anti-money laundering requirements</li>
<li>Compliance with market abuse regulations</li>
<li>Failing to have adequate systems and controls in place to counter the risk of furthering financial crime</li>
<li>Failing to test the adequacy of systems and controls to identify and manage money laundering risks</li>
<li>Civil proceedings for the recovery of WHT reclaims</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What approach should Financial Institutions be taking?</strong></p>
<p>Understanding the exposure to risk, dealing with the regulators and remediating against this background is complex and challenging.</p>
<p>The timescales and volumes involved in dividend arbitrage trading can only be managed with a forensic data-driven approach led by a deep knowledge of market practice and trading norms.</p>
<p>A successful approach will necessitate both analysing structured trading data and blending this with sources of unstructured data (such as chat, email and voice) to accurately quantify risk exposure and to establish, where appropriate, defensible positions across the firm’s book of relevant business.</p>

We discuss some of the challenges with using Apache Kafka over our implemented solution that uses PostgreSQL.</p><h2><strong>RudderStack is a Queue</strong></h2><p>At its core, RudderStack is a queuing system. It gets events from multiple sources, persists them, and then sends them to different destinations. Persisting the events is crucial because RudderStack needs to be able to handle different kinds of failures.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s consider an example here – a destination could be down for any length of time due to some reason. In such a scenario, RudderStack should ideally retain the events and then retry sending the events when that destination is functional once again.</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-1024x312.png" alt="RudderStack - An Event Queue" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-980x298.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-480x146.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-1024x312.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-980x298.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-480x146.png 480w"><figcaption>RudderStack – An Event Queue</figcaption></figure></div><p>Naturally, a popular choice of tool for building such a queuing solution would be Apache Kafka. Kafka provides features such as persistence, ordering, de-duping, extreme performance, horizontal scalability, etc. that any queuing system would need.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple Kafka-based system looks something like this:</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-1024x269.png" alt="A Simple Kafka-Based System" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-980x257.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-480x126.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-1024x269.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-980x257.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-480x126.png 480w"><figcaption>A Simple Kafka-Based System</figcaption></figure></div><p>In our queueing system, we would need to create a separate topic per destination. Events from the sources can be queued into destination-specific topics, while one consumer consumes events from the destination topics. The consumer itself might be spreading the work of sending events across multiple threads for parallelization.&nbsp;</p><p>A separate topic per destination is ideal because if a specific destination is unavailable (e.g., downtime), we do not want to block the events for other destinations. However, as we will see in the next section, failures can be of other types too, leading to complications with this setup.</p><p>While this architecture looks simple enough, Apache Kafka comes with its own set of challenges, which we will focus on in the following sections.</p><h2><strong>Management Challenges</strong></h2><p>Apache Kafka is not the easiest product to deploy and distribute. Moreover, its dependency on Apache Zookeeper – a distributed configuration and synchronization service – makes it quite a <a href="https://medium.com/@anuradha.neo/kafka-is-not-the-best-anymore-meet-pulsar-9eb435c9fc0b">management challenge</a>.</p><p>We did not want to ship and support a product in which we were not experts ourselves.</p><h2><strong>Licensing Issues</strong></h2><p>Licensing was another issue with Apache Kafka. We wanted to release the entire code under an open-source license (AGPLv3). However, the core of Apache Kafka managed by the Apache Foundation is released under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache-2 license</a>. In addition, the version actively managed by Confluent is only available under a non-OSI license (Confluent Community License).&nbsp;</p><p>Some specific Kafka features like kSQL (which is very useful for debugging jobs) are not available under the Apache License.</p><p>One of the key features for the queueing system we built was the ability to peek into the pending events, and update their state, i.e. set their failure state to retry. Implementing this was not possible with an OSS license.</p><h2><strong>Handling Multiple Customers</strong></h2><p>In our hosted, multi-tenant offering, we have multiple customers on the same RudderStack instance. While they can use the same architecture as above with a topic per destination, it can lead to a situation where a large flurry of events from one customer blocks events coming from another customer, as shown in the diagram below:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-1024x247.png" alt="Events From Multiple Customers" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-480x116.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-1024x247.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-480x116.png 480w"><figcaption>Events From Multiple Customers</figcaption></figure></div><p>Ideally, we would want to keep the customers separate so that we can provide the per-customer QoS guarantees.</p><p>The way to do this is to create a separate Kafka topic per destination/customer combination. Unfortunately, Kafka doesn’t scale well with the number of topics. This would eventually become a hindrance our customer-base grows. Our friends at Segment faced a similar issue and wrote a <a href="https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/">blog about it</a>.</p><h2><strong>Error Handling</strong></h2><p>Error handling becomes complex with the data in Kafka. If an event fails to deliver, we wanted to adopt the following workflow:</p><ul><li>Record some metadata like the error code, the number of times it has failed, etc.</li><li>Put it back on top of the queue for subsequent retrying.</li><li>Block further events from that user to preserve the order till the event is successfully delivered (or it is aborted).<br></li></ul><p>The following diagram shows an example of a ‘logical’ state of the system at any point:</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-1024x247.png" alt="A Logical State of the System" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-480x116.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-1024x247.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-480x116.png 480w"><figcaption>A Logical State of the System</figcaption></figure></div><p>Event #1 has failed and must be retried. Along with the event, we also want to keep track of the number of times it was retried, the failure error code, etc. Event #3 is from the same end-user, so it cannot be sent until Event #1 succeeds or aborts. However, Event #2 is unrelated and should be processed and succeeded.</p><p>As seen in the figure above, the queue is processing the events and marking them as succeeded (S), failed (F), or waiting (W). A separate process (or a sweep of the main process) can start from the top. The queue is always in a consistent state, so if there is a crash, we can always start from the top.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not trivial to implement the above logical semantics using Apache Kafka. Kafka does not allow the events to be updated, so we cannot mark the top event as failed, or associate any metadata with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Removing the event and queueing it back (at the end) doesn’t work either, as this will break the ordering constraints – event #3 will end up before event #1, as seen in the example above.&nbsp;</p><h3>Use of Two Queues</h3><p>Another solution is to use two queues – the main queue and a failed queue. The failed jobs and the skipped jobs (from the same user ID) from the main queue can be put in the failed queue. This is demonstrated in the following diagram:</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-1024x471.png" alt="Use of Two Queues" width="580" height="266" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-980x451.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-480x221.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-1024x471.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-980x451.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-480x221.png 480w"><figcaption>Use of Two Queues</figcaption></figure></div><p>The issue with this approach is that this only works for the first failure. How do we handle the failures occurring in the Fail Queue? We still have to update the metadata and re-queue the event, so we will need a second fail queue to store failed events from the 1st fail queue.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to retry events a few dozen times before expiring the event, so this is not a great solution as well.</p><h2><strong>Debuggability</strong></h2><p>Being able to query the events as they wait in the queue and/or update the metadata (around failures) to force immediate retrying is a great debugging feature that we were building at RudderStack. Having a SQL-like query interface to the persisted event helped a lot with that.</p><p>While Kafka’s kSQL provides the query interface, it does not allow for updates. Furthermore, there are licensing issues with kSQL, as we noted earlier.</p><h2><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2><p>In this post, we looked at some of the reasons why we decided to build our own queuing library, instead of adopting a Kafka-based solution. We will write a blog about the implementation but if you are curious, you can explore the implementation on <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">GitHub</a></p><p>With our queueing system powered by PostgreSQL, we could easily change the logic for ordering the events as well as debugging them. In addition, we had complete visibility over all the events coming from a source, user or a destination just by running a SQL query – something that was not possible with Apache Kafka.</p><p>To know more about RudderStack and its features, check out our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/">website</a>.

<p>This has been a whirlwind Labor Day weekend. Not just because I have been printing and resin casting nonstop to get the Pocket Document Camera ready for our students and teachers, but because the conversation regarding it <a href="https://twitter.com/jumekubo/status/1301969450564898816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just blew up on Twitter</a>, in a great way. </p>



<p>What an amazing, thoughtful, kind, and collaborative world we can choose to live in and be a part of. The responses have been overwhelming, in the form of positive feedback, but more importantly in new ideas and problem solving. </p>



<p>I have compiled all the essential information here to serve as a one-stop shop to find what you need. I will continue to update as needed.</p>



<p>The Pocket Document Camera is simple. Essentially, it’s a mirror to project the computer’s camera down to see the keyboard and view anything you place on it. Our main motivation for creating this was that the math department needed a way for students and teachers to show hand-written work while learning remotely. Sharing work has been challenging, particularly when much of that work is on paper. The Pocket Document Camera helps to resolve these issues by allowing students and teachers a simple method for showing work and demonstrating concepts over Zoom.</p>



<h4>The Files and Materials</h4>



<p>My current 3D print and 2D laser cut files can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4588215" target="_blank">seen on Thingiverse here</a>. There is a growing list of versions available for different laptop lid sizes, with contributions from other makers in the last few days. </p>



<ul><li>Maker Michael Johnson (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://twitter.com/mcdanlj" target="_blank">@mcdanlj</a>) even riffed on the original to create an adjustable version that allows you to flip the mirror up when not in use. His version <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gitlab.com/mcdanlj/docucam" target="_blank">can be seen here</a>.)</li><li>Maker Michael Stone (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://twitter.com/CoachStone12" target="_blank">@CoachStone12</a>) has created a slightly modified version of the Macbook Air/Pro version to speed up the printing. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eG0ihGjPdER-macbook-airpro-document-camera" target="_blank">His version can be seen here</a>.</li><li>Maker Jeremy Macdonald (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://twitter.com/MrMacnology" target="_blank">@MrMacnology</a>) created a flexible version out of PETG that fits just about any sized laptop lid. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4592588" target="_blank">His version can be downloaded here</a>.</li></ul>



<p>In addition, I have a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15UEzO1nPM2DgwzXhs-sTcl2YspHoyK8B/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">PDF file</a> that can either be laser cut, or applied over chipboard/cardboard to be cut and assembled by hand.</p>

<p>For chipboard, I used this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013JRFUA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">medium weight version</a>. The mirrors for all models are 2″ square, which I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T8YJQZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">found on Amazon.</a> They are fastened on the base with double-stick foam tape. </p>



<p>If you don’t have access to a 3D printer or laser cutter, or just want to buy, please note that there is a similar product on the market from Ipevo called the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ipevo.com/products/mirror-cam" target="_blank">Mirror Cam</a>. As of this writing, they were back ordered, but hopefully will be available again soon. I really love the design of this model, as it folds up neatly when not in use. People on Twitter have also stated that the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.playosmo.com/" target="_blank">Osmo Reflector</a> can do similar work. </p>



<h4>Reverse Image in Zoom </h4>



<p>By default, when using the Pocket Doc Cam with Zoom, the image on camera is reversed for the participants. While things look normal for the person presenting, it’s a mirror image for everyone else. In most cases, this isn’t such a big deal, but it is problematic when writing is involved. There are a few options for correcting this. </p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w2YMgZquaSUTl0PhYwiRzI_m7FrZg5-XKvKzY7EH0gE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">The fine details regarding these options are documented here.</a></p>



<p><strong>Option 1: Use your built-in camera and share that as your screen</strong></p>



<p>Open your default camera app. It will have the correct orientation for you. While in Zoom, as you screen share, select this app as the window to show. What you see on your screen is what your participants will see. </p>



<p><strong>Option 2: Make a few changes in Zoom Settings</strong></p>



<p>There are two settings that need to be adjusted in Zoom, and the result is that you share your screen to show your video. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w2YMgZquaSUTl0PhYwiRzI_m7FrZg5-XKvKzY7EH0gE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here are the complete directions</a> to set up Zoom in order to do this. A huge thank you to Patrick Leiser for bringing this knowledge to my attention.</p>



<p><strong>Option 3: Use a third party tool, like ManyCam and Ipevo</strong></p>



<p>I saw <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://manycam.com/" target="_blank">ManyCam</a> demo’d a couple of months ago for the purpose of switching between different video sources while live streaming. It is a handy piece of software, one I will definitely use in the future. What I didn’t know at the time, however, is that you can flip the screen on this video source and stream it over Zoom, thereby fixing the mirror image. To learn more about using ManyCam with Zoom, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://help.manycam.com/knowledge-base/zoom/" target="_blank">see this page</a>.</p>



<p>Ipevo offers the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ipevo.com/software/visualizer" target="_blank">Visualizer software</a> for both Win/Mac and as a Chrome extension. Within this app, you can keystone correct, to make the image look as square and flat as possible.</p>



<p><strong>For other platforms: Google Meet, Microsoft Teams</strong></p>



<p>Option #1 above should work for Meet and Teams as well, but I have not personally tested. There are others testing out solutions for Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://twitter.com/MBridgesNMS" target="_blank">@MBridgesNMS</a> shared that she used the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/videomirror/lgknkdljklhkafjfekjjbldfcdnmdpkh?hl=en" target="_blank">VideoMirror Chrome Extension</a> with Google Meet and found success. As far as I can tell, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://help.manycam.com/knowledge-base/microsoft-teams/#:~:text=latest%20update%20here.-,How%20to%20connect%20ManyCam%20with%20Microsoft%20Teams,ManyCam%20Virtual%20Microphone%20as%20Microphone." target="_blank">Microsoft Teams can interface with ManyCam</a>.</p>



<h4>Writing Above the Keyboard</h4>



<p>As many pointed out from my first post, sharing an image is good, but what about writing live on camera? How can you do this well on top of the keyboard? The simplest solution is to create a small table that can lay on top of the keyboard as seen below. </p>


	
	


<p>I made the table just large enough to cover the keyboard and have room for “legs” in each corner.  The legs are actually left over foam from packaging used in the mirrors I purchased.</p>



<p>To add a bit more utility, I used dry erase sticker paper to turn the table into a whiteboard.</p>


	
	


<p>When thinking about what students could build at home for a table, using materials they find laying around, this could be a fun and engaging dive into Design Thinking and product development. I believe there are lots of opportunities for creativity here.</p>



<h4>Don’t Let 3D Printing Slow You Down</h4>



<p>When 3D printing isn’t fast enough to get that class set printed, consider creating a silicone mold of the original 3D print, then cast it using quick-drying liquid plastic (resin). I have <a href="https://johnumekubo.com/2020/03/16/silicone-molds-from-3d-prints/">written previously about this process</a>, and youtube videos abound with tutorials and creative ideas for resin and mold making. It takes about 20 minutes to cure and I have created molds with four units each.</p>

<h4>The Collaborative Potential in Social Media</h4>



<p>I’ll end by stating that one of the most rewarding gifts from this entire experience has been the conversation generated across the globe. People from Canada, to Argentina, to France, to Jakarta and beyond, have chimed in, shared videos, offered advice, solved problems, and sent good wishes. I am blown away, humbled, and inspired. Thank you to everyone, more than I can name here, for your contributions to this page and to this process.</p>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<p>I didn’t intend to become an Upwork Freelancer. While we covered Upwork when we launched the site earlier this year, I was far more interested in <a href="https://highestpayinggigs.com/profitable-drop-servicing-adding-value-as-a-middle-man/">drop servicing</a>, particularly with local businesses. The industry seemed ripe for improvement and there’s just so much more flexibility when you can meet clients face-to-face. Especially if you’re pitching prospects outside of software and digital marketing.</p>



<p>And then Covid-19 hit, sending everyone to their basement. As my own job prospects got murky, I started to take a much closer look at Upwork with new respect. Once you pushed past the hordes of low paying jobs, there were some good things here. Able to find potential clients without leaving your basement? Check. A reliable way to ensure you get paid? Done. <strong>So the real question is: could I get someone to pay me what I think I’m worth in my day job?</strong></p>



<p>In the interests of truth and justice, I decided to run an experiment. In the past 90 days, I applied to over 150 gigs on Upwork offering rates which are generally competitive with my regular job. As a result of this, I accepted offers for five projects which generated over $5,000 in billable income.</p>



<p>The other cool thing about how Upwork operates? In most cases, <strong>I can see who actually won the gig, how much they bid, and how much work they did. </strong></p>



<p>Here’s what I learned along the way.</p>




<h3><strong>Rule 1 – Don’t Compete With Idiots</strong></h3>



<p>You may have heard that Upwork freelance marketplace is a great place to find freelance writer gigs. This is indeed true. However, this has attracted a ton of entry level writers onto the platform. Most of whom have a the same generic profile, with a few idealistic or upbeat sayings that are the freelancing hipster version of being a basic bitch. You literally all look alike.</p>



<p>But it’s all good. Post a generic content writer assignment and you’ll get 20 to 50 applicants. Most of whom are identical. For the statistically inclined, they have a 2% change of being hired.</p>



<p>Actually, it’s probably much worse than that. With that volume of candidates, most hiring managers will rank on either rate (lowest first) or experience (highest billings). And yeah, pitching does matter, so the veterans have an edge there too. In short, the <strong>odds of getting hired for generalist gigs really, really sucks.</strong></p>



<p>I won’t dwell on the fact that the clients for these gigs basically have you at their mercy. Expect to get hit with revisions, adjustments, and other low level extortion as the price of a good review.</p>



<p>I’m sorry, this advice is just pointless and stupid. Do the math. You’re charging up the down escalator. Don’t waste time polishing your damm Upwork profile! Stop competing with hordes of people over low paying jobs!</p>



<p>But I blame your peers, too. The typical advice given to new freelance writers is to “build a portfolio” and polish your Upwork profile. Perhaps even use someone’s job proposal template to show you’re a good fit with the job posting. Jerks. Stop telling people to run up the down escalator! This game is stupid. Your best move is not to play.</p>



<p>There’s a better way. It’s time to become that special snowflake you dreamed about.</p>



<h3><strong>Rule 2 – Find Your People</strong></h3>



<p>I got my first writing gig on Upwork by quoting at double the client’s budget and at least 4 X more than other writers. Since then, I’ve converted her into a steady monthly customer and won offers from other clients in doing business in the same industry. At higher rates.</p>



<p>My secret weapon? Over a decade of experience working in my client’s target industry. While it’s hardly unique experience, I’m the only writer who made that connection. My competitors are basically irrelevant: I’m the only visible expert applying for the gig.</p>



<p>That means I get more interviews, close more deals, and have more leverage to set rates.  </p>



<p>Actually, I’ll take this even further. Don’t waste time applying to any gig where you don’t have unique expertise to bring to the table. With a special emphasis on the word “unique”. Here’s the data to back that up. </p>



<p><strong>My job proposal success rates, by project type and relative fit.</strong></p>



<ul><li>Digital Marketing – ZERO win rate</li><li>Content Writing – 3% win rate</li><li>Industry Expert Content – 11% win rate</li><li>Gigs in Target Industry – 33% win rate</li></ul>



<p>With 150 data points, the market has spoken. </p>



<p>The differences above are almost entirely due to competitive pressure. My digital marketing resume is far more impressive than my non-existent content writer resume. Seriously, I would be laughed out of a room if I tried to apply for a regular writing job. Unfortunately, Upwork is swamped with digital marketer – many of whom were happy to undercut me by more than 40%. Youch! Game over… </p>



<p>While I still need to level up as an industry expert content writer, at least I’m not fighting legions of people willing to work for peanuts. So niche down. <strong>You’ll have far more luck hunting gigs in a small pond where you’re the big fish than competing in an open casting call with 50 peers.</strong> Find your people and focus on them.</p>



<h3><strong>Rule 3 – Lead With Unique Value</strong></h3>



<p>Ah, the Upwork Profile. The most over-analyzed piece of the freelancer marketing equation. Often the subject of bloviating self-adoration and utterly meaningless platitudes. Let me simplify what to put on a freelancer profile. </p>



<p><strong>The bare minimum.</strong></p>



<p>Seriously. The same goes for any job proposal as well. There are handful of things that you want to say to a prospective client that will get you hired. The key points of difference that signal to a new client that you’re the answer to their problem.</p>



<p>Everything outside of that is irrelevant.</p>



<p>Your typical client reviews dozens of applications. Get to the point. Stand out. Don’t try to sell every aspect of your services in the job proposal or on your profile. All you want to do is trigger an invite.</p>



<p>The one exception to this I’d recommend is using the job history descriptions to stuff some relevant keywords into your profile. Mention the skills that you want to be found for several times. All of that text is buried at the bottom of the page, so most clients won’t actually read it.</p>



<p>The top of the freelance profile page needs to be focused and hard hitting. The same for the first several lines of your job proposal.<strong> Unload 3 key points which set you apart from everyone else. Ask for a meeting. Done.</strong></p>



<h3><strong>Rule 4 – Don’t Be Afraid to Bid Over Budget</strong></h3>



<p>One nice benefit of freelancer plus is it lets you take a peek at the distribution of rates for the Upwork job that you’re bidding on. Keep notes.</p>



<p>Along the same lines, it is worth investing the time to check up on past proposals, to see who won and at what price. Again, I recommend keeping notes about what price the gig settled at and how much work was ultimately done on the project. </p>



<p>Tracking job application results like this will start to give you a feel for where the market really is. This should guide how you bid on job opportunities going forward. That’s one of the strengths of working on a freelancing platform such as Upwork, since you get a lot more data that you would from a typical freelance client.</p>



<h3><strong>Rule 5 – Screen Clients Aggressively</strong></h3>



<p>The wealth of data about clients is by far the best benefit of the Upwork freelancing platform. Unlike an offline freelance client, you can see their hiring history, buying patterns, and job feedback. This is immensely helpful in optimizing your time.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the job posting. Is it well written, clear, and generally sane? You may have a keeper. <strong>Does it display any signs of delusions of grandeur, excessive client ego, or an abusive attitude towards freelancers? Just hit next.</strong> That rarely improves once you’ve got a contract and they can decide if you get a good review.</p>



<p>Now, look at their hiring history, specifically the comments section. Do they treat their typical freelancer with respect? Do they sound fairly reasonable in disputes? They could be a keeper. <strong>Do they lose their cool and start screaming names? They may not be a good fit.</strong></p>



<p><strong>You also need to look at the client’s average hire rate across the history of the account. One thing I noticed: a large fraction of the job postings appear to expire without actually ending in a hire. This was substantially worse for clients who didn’t have a history of hiring on Upwork. From what I could gather, it looks like 40% of the gigs posted by experienced clients ended without a hire. This jumped to 65% if the client posted the profile was new to Upwork.</strong></p>



<p>Lesson: be cautious about over-investing in a client who is new to Upwork. It seems like you may need to make a “double-sale”, first selling them on the idea of hiring you and  then getting them comfortable with the Upwork Platform. A repeat user is more to the point – they know the drill. Then again, if you like the job post, apply. Several of my favorite gigs were sketchy clients.</p>



<p>One more item you can judge from looking at a client’s profile: what are the odds of getting hired for additional work? The value of this will vary by job type: the finance and strategy work I’ve done is mostly one time projects, whereas a freelance writer can often solicit additional articles. This can substantially increase the value of a client.</p>



<h3><strong>Rule 6 – Understand </strong><strong>Hourly Projects</strong><strong> vs. Fixed Price</strong></h3>



<p>There are two schools of thought in terms of how to bid a freelance project. </p>



<p>If you quote an hourly rate, you’re relatively safe from client changes. On the other hand, the client may ask to monitor your work, which is an intrusive annoyance in my book. That being said, you’re still basically an employee in many ways.</p>



<p>Fixed price contracts, while reviled for being used for low paying jobs, place full control over the production process in the hands of a freelancer. Any delays are your issue (as are changes) along with any revisions or rework. On the positive side, any productivity savings are yours to keep.

        <p>A story on Hacker News recently argued that webpage speeds haven't improved, even as internet speeds have gone up.</p>
<p>This article explains why that conclusion can't be drawn from the original data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at how devices and the web have changed over the past 10 years, and what those changes have meant for web performance.</p>

<h2 id="interpreting-the-http-archive-data">Interpreting the HTTP Archive data</h2>
<p>This chart from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">Nielsen Norman Group article</a> suggested that increasing mobile network bandwidth hasn't resulted in faster page load times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart.png" alt="Chart showing increasing bandwidth along increasing page load times"></p>
<p>However, <strong>the connection speed used by HTTP Archive has not actually increased over time.</strong></p>
<p>Instead it went down in 2013, <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-test-environment-that-might-affect-the-data">switching from wifi to an emulated 3G connection</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart-annotated.png" alt="Annotation for page loads time showing when methodology changed"></p>
<p>The onLoad metric has increased 55% since 2013, from 12.7s to 19.7s. If you bought a phone in 2013 and have been on a 3G connection ever since, then the web has become slower for you.</p>
<p>Before looking at how devices and the web have changed over the last 10 years, here are a few notes on how to think about this data.</p>
<h3 id="why-look-at-on-load">Why look at onLoad?</h3>
<p>The <code>load</code> event is emitted by the page when all page resources like scripts or images have been downloaded.</p>
<p>If the top of a page renders quickly, but the page also loads 20 images further down, then the onLoad metric will suggest that the page is slow.</p>
<p>A different page might not initially render anything useful at all, and only start loading additional resources and rendering content long after the onLoad event. Yet this page will appear fast.</p>
<p>As a result, onLoad doesn't do a good job measuring whether a user experiences the page as fast.</p>
<p>So why do we even look at this metric? <strong>Because it's been around for a long time</strong>, and HTTP Archive has been tracking it since 2010. Newer metrics like <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> or Time to Interactive were only added to HTTP Archive in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-expect-increasing-bandwidth-to-result-in-faster-page-load-times">Should we expect increasing bandwidth to result in faster page load times?</h3>
<p>Increasing bandwidth will only make a page load faster if bandwidth is the bottleneck at some point. It won't help if you're on a Gigabit connection with a 1s network roundtrip time.</p>
<p>However, the 1.6Mbps 3G connection emulated by HTTP Archive is very slow, so we should expect significant performance improvements as bandwidth improves. The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-http-archive-caveats">Some more HTTP Archive caveats</h3>
<p>I'll talk a lot about "the average website" in this article. It's worth noting that HTTP Archive only collects data on homepages, not pages deeper down in the site. The corpus of tested domains has also grown over time.</p>
<p>The tests weren't always run on the same device. Initially a physical iPhone 4 was used, today the tests are run on an emulated Android device.</p>
<p>We'll look at median metric values in this article. If most websites are fast but one in five websites freeze your phone for 20s we won't be able to pick this up.</p>
<h3 id="performance-on-desktop">Performance on desktop</h3>
<p>This article will focus on mobile performance in the US. However, if you're looking at the desktop data from the original article, it's worth noting that the test bandwidth was increased and latency was reduced in 2013.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/desktop-performance.png" alt="Chart showing desktop connection speeds and when emulated connection speed changed"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-mobile-networks-and-devices-changed-over-the-last-10-years">How have mobile networks and devices changed over the last 10 years?</h2>
<p>Let's look at 4 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth</li>
<li>network latency</li>
<li>processor speeds</li>
<li>browser performance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-network-bandwidth-in-the-us">Mobile network bandwidth in the US</h3>
<p>This chart shows average mobile bandwidth in the US by year, according to different sources. It increased from 1 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-bandwidth.png" alt="Mobile bandwidth in the US by year"></p>
<p>(I've not been very careful when collecting this data. For example, I didn't consistently distinguish when data was collected from when it was published. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZ_ngADpT3YzezNQLpXKCsr74-BvaBJUkYm6PGpv1g/edit?usp=sharing">You can find my sources here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="mobile-network-latency-in-the-us">Mobile network latency in the US</h3>
<p>This was harder to find data on, but the results indicate that latency dropped from around 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-latency.png" alt="Mobile latency in the US by year, going down from 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020"></p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-cpu-speeds">Mobile device CPU speeds</h3>
<p>I've not been able to find data on average mobile device speeds in the US. But <a href="https://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> and <a href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> have published a <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1233275220275818498">chart showing GeekBench 4 scores alongside the release years of different phones</a>.</p>
<p>Even budget phones have become 4x faster, with iPhones now being up to 20x more powerful.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/mobile-cpu-benchmark.jpeg" alt="Mobile CPU performance over time"></p>
<h3 id="how-have-browsers-changed">How have browsers changed?</h3>
<p>A lot of work has been done on browsers over the last 10 years. JavaScript has become a larger part of the web, so many improvements have focussed here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/10-years">this chart from the V8 blog</a>, page CPU usage for gone down by a factor of 4.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/v8-performance.png" alt="V8 Speedometer 1 benchmark results 2013 to 2018"></p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Browser networking has also improved, for example with the introduction of HTTP/2 in 2015. 64% of requests are now served over HTTP/2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 adoption over time"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-websites-changed">How have websites changed?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some data from HTTP Archive to see how websites have changed.</p>
<h3 id="page-weight">Page weight</h3>
<p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">Mobile page weight</a> increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020. This is primarily driven by an increase in images and JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Other resources also increased a lot –&nbsp;I suspect these are mostly videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/page-weight.png" alt="Page weight by resource type over time"></p>
<p>The chart starts in 2013 as HTTP Archive changed its methodology in October 2012. Before page weight was undercounted, as the test stopped when the page load event was triggered, even if more data was still being loaded.</p>
<h3 id="java-script-execution-time">JavaScript execution time</h3>
<p>JavaScript would be the most likely culprit if pages are getting slower despite faster mobile networks. Unfortunately, HTTP Archive only started collecting this data in late 2017, and it seems to have been mostly stable since then.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/javascript-execution-time.png" alt="HTTP Archive JavaScript execution time chart"></p>
<p>The drop in mid-2018 can probably be attributed to a URL corpus change.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute run duration (0.5s) is less than what you'd normally see in a tool like Lighthouse. These tools normally slow down JavaScript execution to emulate a mobile device, but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#lighthouse">this was broken for the HTTP Archive tests</a>. So while this number might be realistic for mid-range phones, a common assumption is that budget phones are around 4x slower.</p>
<h2 id="answering-whether-the-web-has-become-slower">Answering whether the web has become slower</h2>
<p>Has the web become slower? Well, it depends on what your device, network connection, and most-used websites are.</p>
<p>We'd need to weigh real-world performance data to get a distribution that shows how different users experienced the web over time. And should the experience of someone opening thousands of pages a day count as much as someone who only visits Facebook once a week?</p>
<p>I don't have detailed per-user data, but we can take a look at the question in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-user data from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report (CrUX)</a></li>
<li>Naive modelling based on how websites and devices have changed</li>
</ol>
<p>I also tried downloading old page versions from archive.org and testing them with Lighthouse, but wasn't able to get meaningful results in the time I had available. For example, often some images are missing from the page archive.</p>
<h2 id="data-from-the-chrome-user-experience-report">Data from the Chrome User Experience Report</h2>
<p>The big limitation of CrUX data is that it's only been collected since late 2017. But we can still use it to see if the web has become slower in the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike HTTP Archive, CrUX looks at the whole domain instead of just homepages.</p>
<p>The data we'll look at is the 75th percentile, meaning pages load at least this fast for 75% of users.</p>
<p>(I'm taking the average across websites rather than the median, which is not great.)</p>
<h3 id="us-page-load-times">US page load times</h3>
<p>CrUX data for the US does not show page performance getting worse.</p>
<p>The onLoad metric shows a slight improvement, maybe due to an increase in bandwidth. Or maybe more activity is now happening after the initial page load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-us.png" alt="Page load speeds in the US"></p>
<p>The paint metrics seem fairly stable. Largest Contentful Paint is a new metric that has only been collected since mid-2019.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-world">The rest of the world</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the US onLoad metric is matched by the global data. There are however signifianct differences in page load times across countries, with onLoad timings in India being almost twice those in South Korea.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-global.png" alt="Page load speeds globally, in the US, UK, Korea, and India"></p>
<p>We can use CrUX data to put HTTP Archive data into perspective. In January 2020 HTTP Archive reported a median (50% percentile) load time of 18.7s, based on its synthetic data.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrUX suggests a load time of just 5.8s –&nbsp;and this is the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>(Note that the Global values here just take an average and are not weighed by population.)</p>
<h2 id="modelling-page-load-times">Modelling page load times</h2>
<p>We can create a theoretical model of how changes in devices, networks, and websites might affect overall performance.</p>
<p>This won't be a great model, but hopefully it will still provide some insight.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-page-download-time">Theoretical page download time</h3>
<p>Page weight has increased over time, but so has bandwidth. Round-trip latency has also gone down.</p>
<p>Downloading a file the size of the median mobile website would have taken 1.7s in 2013. If your connection hasn't improved since then downloading this much data would now take 4.4s. But with an average connection today it would only take 0.9s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/minimum-page-download-time.png" alt="TCP download time"></p>
<p>In practice, a website wouldn't consist of just a single request, and other factors like CPU processing or server latency would also affect how quickly the page loads. The onLoad times reported by HTTP Archive are 2-3 times this lower bound.</p>
<p>But we can still use this as an indicator that reduced latency and increased bandwidth have helped make websites load faster overall.</p>
<p>(I'm starting in 2013 rather than 2011, as the HTTP Archive page weight metric has only been measured consistently since then.)</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to think about this, but I'll make some guesses anyway.</p>
<p>Someone who used a Galaxy S4 in 2013 and now uses a Galaxy S10 will have seen their CPU processing power go up by a factor of 5. Let's assume that browsers have become 4x more efficient since then. If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

                In 100 years, passport discrimination will be seen as wrong as skin-colour discrimination
              </h2>

              <p>September 2020</p>

              <p>
                It's 2020, and you're browsing the web when you see a job ad with something very unusual:
              </p>

              <p>
                <i>"We're looking for experienced marketers to help us launch a new product line. White candidates only, please".</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                Infuriating and depressing! How long do you think it would take for every news agency in the world to be talking about this? And for this company to go out of business? And how about for the authors to be facing criminal charges?
              </p>

              <p>
                This entire situation sounds very unlikely to happen today. But isn't it disturbing to think that less than a century ago this would be just another ordinary day?
              </p>

              <p>
                Now, replace the <i>"White candidates only"</i> with <i>"Australian residents only"</i>, and you have a real example of thousands of modern job ads shared around the web every day.
              </p>

                <i>(Illustration from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960/">Open Borders</a> by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith)</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                I was born in Brazil, and as I grew up, I became each year more distant and frustrated with the country's (and my) future. Living in one of the poorest states in the country, I was one of the very few who was lucky and privileged to have parents who could afford to send me for a year abroad during high-school.
              </p>

              <p>
                I spent my last year of high school in the U.S., a life-changing and mind-expanding event. With one caveat, though. I wasn't allowed to work and get paid anywhere while I was in the country. I still remember my American friends giving me a ride on their way to work after school and perplexed that I depended on my parents sending me money from overseas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Back in Brazil, as I entered university and started working as a software developer, I found myself dreaming about working and living in Australia. But once again, I wasn't allowed, I was born in Brazil.
              </p>

              <p>
                As an 18-year old, my obsession with moving to Australia wasn't just rational. It was also an emotional one. I knew I wanted to scape the fear of daily violence in Brazil. I dreamed about a society with less economic inequality. But I also pictured myself surfing in Australian waves.
              </p>

              <p>
                And to be fair, I didn't understand what was wrong with that. I wanted a better life right away. A better life obviously means different things for different people. For me, I knew it would be a move to Australia. But I couldn't just save some money, buy a ticket and fly to Oceania. No, I would be committing a crime if I did that, I was born in the wrong place to do that.
              </p>

              <p>
                By then, I spoke English and was getting more experienced in my field each year. After years contacting hundreds of companies in Australia and doing remote test projects, I was offered a job with visa sponsorship, meaning I would get a temporary work visa to live in the "lucky country".
              </p>

              <p>
                Everything worked out for me, and I've relocated permanently to Australia. But that was never the case for thousands of people who have contacted me in the last ten years asking for help to do the same. In fact, that's not the case for approximately one billion people in the world today.
              </p>

              <p>
                Accordingly to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/124028/700-million-worldwide-desire-migrate-permanently.aspx">Gallup World Poll</a>, 16% of the world's adults would like to move to another country permanently if they had the chance.
              </p>

              <p>
                The point is: That same feeling I had about moving to Australia is not uncommon. Millions of people daydream about a similar move to a better country their entire lives. The sad part is that my migration story is an outlier. The vast majority of people are not able to legally enter the more developed nations due to current immigration law.
              </p>

              <p>
                Removing (or at least reducing) immigration restrictions would not just be the right and moral thing to do. It would be one of the smartest and most impactful economic moves we could make.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's practically unanimous between economists that reducing immigration restrictions would make the world more productive. To be more specific, estimates are we would instantly get close to <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/economics-and-emigration-trillion-dollar-bills-sidewalk-working-paper-264">doubling global GDP</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                But if economic gains are so clear, why do countries decide to close their borders to foreigners?
              </p>

              <p>
                I prefer not to enter the immigration debate directly linked to political elections around the world in the last couple of decades. People are too zoomed-in to see the big picture and think un-emotionally about at least small reductions in immigration restrictions that would create a net gain for most people.
              </p>

              <p>
                The most frequent counter-arguments I hear are:
              </p>

              <p>
                1) Mass migration would create mass poverty. A popular one is that everyone from South America and Africa would move to the U.S., which would, in turn, become a poor country.
              </p>

              <p>
                2) No developed nation would be able to afford the new demand for their welfare programs. How would they keep a quality health system or unemployment protection program in place?
              </p>

              <p>
                3) Terrorism.
              </p>

              <p>
                4) The receiving countries would risk losing their national culture.
              </p>

              <p>
                I can understand people raising these questions. It's just not productive that this is where they stop when they think about freer immigration. They are moved by fear and passion, and no healthy debate can come from that.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you're interested in learning more about such questions, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316960/">Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration</a>.
              </p>

              <p>
                Whatever your view and belief are about this topic, the truth is that at least small improvements can be made. The default logic for immigration law in 2020 is simply cruel.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the things that seem almost always to surprise people is knowing that having a passport and not being able to go to a country because of visa restrictions is a very recent phenomenon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Until 1914, there were no travel restrictions based on where you were born. Anyone could go anywhere. Every individual could make their own decisions about where in the world they would be able to live a better life, as long as they had a way to make it to their desired destination.
              </p>

              <p>
                And then came World War I, security concerns and the introduction of the modern passport as we know it. Germany, France and Italy were the first ones to officialise its use. By the end of the war, the system had global mass adoption.
              </p>

              <p>
                The passport with visa restrictions was supposed to be a temporary "hack". For the next several decades, governments held international conferences to discuss getting rid of passports and restoring the freedom of movement for everyone.
              </p>

              <p>
                But the temporary hack became a complex system with no easy way back. Less than a hundred years later, and we had all got used to it and could not imagine life without it anymore. No matter what, you have to agree we got used to critical loss of freedom.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm optimistic, and the good news is that if you zoom out, you can see the world is moving in the right direction on several fronts. There are still errors and injustices, of course, and the passport in its current form is an example. A mistake, I believe, that will be corrected slowly in the next few decades. I expect we will be talking about passport discrimination, the same way the world is currently talking about discrimination based on gender, skin colour or age, for example. No discrimination can be accepted, and as humans, I expect us to continue learning and evolving.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the meantime, there's a lot more that could be done. A few examples: We could easily have at least ten times more free movement agreements between neighbour countries. The developed countries should be creating more flexible work-holiday programs, open to a much higher number of people than current volumes. And points-based immigration systems could be used as a way to start opening up the most strict and closed countries.
              </p>

                <i>(Small agreement between Australia and Vanuatu in September 2020)</i>
              </p>

              <p>
                On a final note, our complex immigration programs, which change from country to country, create another substantial barrier: Access to information. I'm building <a href="https://www.duoflag.com/">Duoflag</a> as a side project in a small attempt to have a centralised resource for people to discover and understand their options to migrate to another country. I wish this existed twenty years ago when I was researching my options. If this is something you're also interested in, I would love to hear from you and join forces.

September 8, 2020 | https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let's face it, It is not easy to choose a freaking PC these days with the deluge of specifications that come with it let alone FPGAs. The question of using FPGAs to solve any computing problem only arises when an extraordinary performance is required. Owing to this fact, FPGAs in their feature specification and build can be extremely specific to the application at hand. This results in an insane number of varieties in terms of the logic structures within the FPGA as well as the interfaces that are provided with the external world. However, this guide aims to guide you in the right direction (which does not mean dumping a list of the hundreds of different options out there) based on your level of experience and requirement.</p>
<p>There are other posts out there that provide large tables with exhaustive lists of FPGA development boards out there and let you (after a year or two of research) make a choice. If that's your thing, I'll attach some links to help you get started.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>If you're already familiar with the various bells and whistles of  FPGAs and are only looking for some good suggestions, you might prefer to <a href="https://thedatabus.io/fpga-buying-guide#the-top-contenders"><strong>JUMP TO THE LIST OF SUGGESTIONS</strong></a>.  If not, read on to learn some very important stuff about the FPGA world and how to choose better!</em></p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-be-looking-for"><a href="#what-you-should-be-looking-for" aria-label="what you should be looking for permalink"></a>What you should be looking for</h2>
<p>There are already a lot of aspects to an FPGA in general that determine its fit to a particular problem and the ease with which it can be programmed, now add to this the complexity of a feature-rich development board with all sorts of peripherals, interfaces, connectors and memory options you have at hand a humongous task of deciding between hundreds of varieties out there.</p>
<h3 id="soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga"><a href="#soc-based-board-or-just-an-fpga" aria-label="soc based board or just an fpga permalink"></a>SOC based board or just an FPGA?</h3>
<p>SOC stands for <a href="https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/integrated-circuit/ic-types/system-on-chip/" target="_blank">System-on-Chip</a> which simply means that various interacting technologies are built onto the same die (/chip). You see SOCs everywhere, on your phones, TVs, and computers. In the context of an FPGA development board, a SOC based system means that the hardware has two components, a sea of programmable logic (the FPGA) and a hard processor core implemented in silicon independent of the programmable FPGA logic. Interfaces are created between the programmable logic and the processing system (in Xilinx lingo) that enable communication between the two regions.</p>
<p><img src="https://thedatabus.io/static/zynq7000-ae213195db5b530cc3f5d60785b3b0b1.png" alt="Zynq7000"></p>
<p>If you are an absolute beginner looking for direction, you should definitely choose a SOC based system because of the immense additional learning potential it adds. Having said that, your first few digital design projects should never involve the processor cores or any kind of software programming. For that, you can just ignore the processor logic and dump your design into the programmable region to use it as a normal FPGA. As you progress, you can add much higher levels of complexity to your design by bringing in the processor core to directly read and write data in your configurable hardware. You can also experiment with writing firmware, drivers, the Linux OS, and the higher levels of abstraction thus getting a truly holistic experience of embedded system design. Even the simplest SOC based board will keep you busy for a long time. </p>
<p>These boards can also be of great interest for Software engineers looking to explore into the digital design world since processor + FPGA structures lend themselves very well to paradigms like HLS, Heterogenous computing and partial acceleration of algorithms. Viewing the FPGA logic as an extension of the SOC is something that is going to be very important in the future and is a good investment of your time.</p>
<p>Alternatively, If you are a beginner but are looking only to learn digital design or you wish to buy a board to complement your studies at college where you get to use a particular board in your lab, you can get a lot more basic FPGA resources (LUTs, BRAMs, DSPs) on a Non-SOC based board that has only the FPGA. This way you save money and have a much less complex system at hand that you can comprehend better. The same is true If you plan to implement something specific that takes up an enormous number of resources, you might be better off going for a dev board that has only the FPGA and the required peripherals.</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/9yutk8/best_100300_fpga_development_board_in_2018/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">this post</a> on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/" target="_blank">r/FPGA</a> user <strong>u/ndbroadbent</strong> has shown the resource usages of several open source projects, this can give you a good idea of how big projects usually are.</p>
<p><strong>An important note for beginners</strong> : <em>Having an SOC board, with all the processor logic around the FPGA can really deviate you from the basic idea of programmable logic and how you're supposed to learn it. I strongly suggest completely disregarding anything to do with the processor for your first few projects and use only the FPGA part of the device. Also note that as of today, any good FPGA engineer will tell you that any form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis#:~:text=High%2Dlevel%20synthesis%20(HLS),hardware%20that%20implements%20that%20behavior."><strong>HLS</strong></a> is not good enough to be used in real world projects. This is doubly true for the beginners. <strong>DO NOT</strong> fall into the 'Write code in C++/Python and run it on FPGA' trap. A lot of youtubers seem to be promoting stuff like that for beginners these days which is just sad. If you have the money to spend, the ideal (and more enjoyable) learning strategy would be to use a standalone FPGA board first and upgrade to an SOC later.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="interfaces-and-ios"><a href="#interfaces-and-ios" aria-label="interfaces and ios permalink"></a>Interfaces and IOs:</h3>
<p>FPGAs are excellent tools for working on high-speed interfaces. So you might want to look at the interfaces and IO options a particular development board is providing. This is important because if the board has a particular interface out of the box, the vendor will probably provide the necessary documentation and sample designs for those interfaces. This can save you tons of head-scratching and hair-pulling (trust me that is common in the FPGA world) as a beginner. That's not to say that newer interfaces cannot be added to the board manually but when it comes to High-speed interfaces like Ethernet, HDMI, PCIe, it can be very difficult to add them yourself and expect reliable performance. Low-speed ones like SPI, UART, etc can always be manually added using the GPIOs, so let them not be the dealbreaker for any board.</p>
<p>Some common networking interfaces that you should look for are high-speed interfaces like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI" target="_blank"><strong>HDMI</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array" target="_blank"><strong>VGA</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" target="_blank"><strong>ETHERNET</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express" target="_blank"><strong>PCIe</strong></a>  etc. and low-speed peripherals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface" target="_blank"><strong>SP</strong>I</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus" target="_blank"><strong>CAN</strong></a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C" target="_blank"><strong>I2C</strong></a>  etc.</p>
<p>Although not as important for a beginner, another set of interfaces that can be useful are the analog and sensor interfaces like ADCs, DACs, Camera Interface, Audio CODECs, etc. These are very niche features that can make or break a particular project if it depends on data acquisition from the external world.</p>
<p>If you choose to go for a board with not too many peripherals for whatever reason, you might be better off choosing one that has the industry-standard <a href="https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-modules-connectors/" target="_blank"><strong>PMOD</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA_Mezzanine_Card" target="_blank"><strong>FMC</strong></a> connectors installed so that when you do need additional interfaces in the future, they can be added very easily. These standard connectors essentially decouple FPGA carrier boards from the IO engines (which plug-in as daughter cards), enabling you to use the same FPGA boards with a large variety of IO designs without ever having to re-design the board.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="buttons-leds-and-displays"><a href="#buttons-leds-and-displays" aria-label="buttons leds and displays permalink"></a>Buttons, LEDs, and Displays:</h3>
<p>Debugging FPGA designs can be a hard thing. Unlike MCUs where you can place print statements and breakpoints anywhere you want in the code, there is no such equivalent in the FPGA world and that can often lead to great frustration. One workaround is possible, if there are switches and LEDs on your board. They provide an easy way to pull out signals to the real world and give you an indication of the status of some status registers that can help you visualize and debug (like the current state of a state machine or a particular flag in a CPU design). However, this should not be the deciding factor between two boards since it is very easy to add LEDs, buttons, switches, and LCDs using the GPIO connectors without much effort.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="memory-and-resource-count"><a href="#memory-and-resource-count" aria-label="memory and resource count permalink"></a>Memory and Resource Count:</h3>
<p>The Resource Count is another important metric that goes into deciding on an FPGA device. By resource, we mean the number of programmable logic elements available on the board. These can be LUTs (ALMs for Altera), Block Rams, DSPs, and IO blocks. Much more complex and fancier devices like the  <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/acap/versal.html" target="_blank"> Versal family</a> from Xilinx can have lots of other stuff like AI, video, and audio cores, etc. It is important to take note of these resource numbers because they determine the biggest project that you can successfully fit onto the FPGA. It is hard to come up with a fixed count for a particular project owing to differences in the underlying CLB architecture from vendor to vendor and family to family.</p>
<p>FPGAs store the configuration(bitstream) data on the SRAM (usually) cells within the FPGA. Since SRAM is a volatile kindof memory, the program is lost each time the board is power-cycled. A PC support is needed to reprogram it again after the power cycle, to prevent this, FLASH (or EEPROM in older boards) based storage is provided onboard by the vendors. Flash is a non-volatile form of storage that holds the bitstream data even without a power supply. Each time the board comes up after a power cycle, the FPGA checks the flash memory for a bitstream and programs itself with it. This is usually given by default in most boards but can be something important to look out for. </p>
<p>The other important form of memory is the external onboard volatile storage which is most commonly provided in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM" target="_blank">DDR SDRAM</a>  This is extremely useful if you are building an application that needs to store data locally for whatever reason. Since the block ram storage within the FPGA fabric is very little and is very precious, having a DDR that can be written to and read from in a reasonable amount of time is very much essential. The more the better!

      <p>In Ed25519 signatures, there is a place where some “bit-twiddling” is done on the
private key which is typically called “clamping”. The information on the
reasoning for this is sparse and the descriptions that do exist never went into
enough detail for me to fully understand it. This post aims to explain the
rationale for doing this clamping and why it works.</p>

<h2>What is clamping?</h2>

<p>Clamping is the action of applying some deterministic manipulation to some
input bytes, typically using bitwise operations. It can be used for many
purposes, but one common use is to force arbitrary values into a particular
integer range by setting or zeroing bits in a particular way. For Ed25519 it’s
used for other reasons which we will cover later, but is done on a 32-byte
input and looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>input[0] &amp;= 248
input[31] &amp;= 127
input[31] |= 64
</code></pre>

<h2>When is clamping used?</h2>

<p>Clamping is used to deterministically derive the private &amp; public key from
a 32-byte “seed”. This seed is provided as input to an implementation when you
want to derive the public key or sign a message. Here are where we see this done
in the golang standard library:</p>

<p>First, in key generation, it derives the public key using the following logic.
Ed25519 also requires that you SHA512 the seed and use the first 32-bytes for
the clamp, but it’s not relevant to the clamping itself. That step is done
simply to protect against bad seed randomness which is non-uniform.</p>

<pre><code>digest := sha512.Sum512(seed)
digest[0] &amp;= 248
digest[31] &amp;= 127
digest[31] |= 64

var A edwards25519.ExtendedGroupElement
var hBytes [32]byte
copy(hBytes[:], digest[:])
edwards25519.GeScalarMultBase(&amp;A, &amp;hBytes)
var publicKeyBytes [32]byte
A.ToBytes(&amp;publicKeyBytes)

// source: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/11f92e9dae96939c2d784ae963fa7763c300660b/src/crypto/ed25519/ed25519.go#L98-L141
</code></pre>

<p>The second place is during signing, we see the same clamping is applied. In the
golang implementation the “private key” is a 64-byte value which is <code>seed ||
public_key</code>, so the second line is where the seed is being fed into the hash
function.</p>

<pre><code>h := sha512.New()
h.Write(privateKey[:32])

var digest1, messageDigest, hramDigest [64]byte
var expandedSecretKey [32]byte
h.Sum(digest1[:0])
copy(expandedSecretKey[:], digest1[:])
expandedSecretKey[0] &amp;= 248
expandedSecretKey[31] &amp;= 63
expandedSecretKey[31] |= 64

// source: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/11f92e9dae96939c2d784ae963fa7763c300660b/src/crypto/ed25519/ed25519.go#L162-L171
</code></pre>

<p>While I’ve used the golang standard library as an example, you will be able to
find similar code in almost any library implementing ed25519. They are almost
all ports of the <a href="http://bench.cr.yp.to/supercop.html">SUPERCOP</a> implementation so the code is all very similar.</p>

<h2>But why do we need to do this?</h2>

<p>With the background out of the way, now we can get to the meat of this post.
What exactly is the clamping doing and why is it done?</p>

<p>The first thing to be aware of when we’re dealing with byte arrays in ed25519
is they are represented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</a> which means that the least
significant byte is first. This is important to keep in mind because if you
start thinking in big-endian this will be very confusing.</p>

<pre><code>input[0] &amp;= 248  // 248 == 0b11111000
input[31] &amp;= 127 // 127 == 0b01111111
input[31] |= 64  // 64  == 0b01000000
</code></pre>

<p>In the first line, we are “clearing” or “zeroing” the lowest three bits of the
first byte. This works because if we <code>&amp;</code> with 0, it will always be 0 in the
output, but if we <code>&amp;</code> with 1, it will retain whatever value was already there.</p>

<p>The second line and third line work together to clear the 256th bit and set the
255th bit to 1. The second line does the clearing using the same logic as the
first and the third uses <code>|</code> to “set” a specific bit. It works using similar
logic to how <code>&amp;</code> works, if we <code>|</code> with 0 we retain whatever value was there,
and if we <code>|</code> with 1 it will always produce 1, so we can set a specific bit.</p>

<p>At the end of this clamping we’ve taken a 32-byte value and cleared the lowest
3 bits and set the 255th bit as the highest bit.</p>

<h3>Clearing the lowest three bits</h3>

<p>Cleaning these bits does something known as “clearing the cofactor”. A cofactor
is one of the parameters that make up an elliptic curve. The number of points
on the elliptic curve can be described as <code>n = r * h</code> where r is the prime
order of a subgroup and h is the cofactor. If the cofactor is 1, like in many
of the standardized curves, it’s not something we need to worry about.  If it
is not one, careful consideration needs to be made for it’s implications in
cryptographic schemes to avoid a few types of attacks, notably <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2785">small-subgroup
attacks</a> and more <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/2017/05/17/disclosure-of-a-major-bug-in-cryptonote-based-currencies.html">nuanced malleability attacks that affected
Monero</a>.</p>

<p>As a consequence of Lagrange’s Theorem, this means that the possible orders of
the curve’s subgroups are the divisors of <code>n</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lagrange’s Theorem</strong>: For any finite group G, the order (number of
elements) of every subgroup H of G divides the order of G.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In ed25519 we use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-4.1">edwards25519</a> which has a prime <code>r</code> and cofactor of 8. This
means that set of divisors of <code>n</code> is the union of the divisors of <code>r</code> and 8.
Since <code>r</code> is prime it’s divisors are simply <code>{1, r}</code>, the divisors of 8 are
<code>{1, 2, 4, 8}</code>. Putting all this together, every subgroup of edwards25519 must
have one of the following orders <code>{1, 2, 4, 8, r}</code>.</p>

<p>Back to the bits, what does clearing the lowest three do to the integer? It
turns it into multiple of 8, the cofactor. Here’s why this is useful. In
protocols like diffie-hellman where you combine a secret with an externally
provided point, there is the possibility of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2785">small-subgroup attacks</a> which can
cause you to leak your secret. By making the secret a multiple of 8, we no
longer have to worry about this and we will always get a point in the prime
order subgroup.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that an adversary provides a point <code>H</code> from the subgroup with
order 8 and we multiply it by our secret <code>x</code> to get the diffie-hellman point <code>S
= xH</code>. The order of a group is defined as the smallest positive integer m such
that a^m = e, where e denotes the identity element of the group.</p>

<p>Because our secret is a multiple of 8, we can rewrite <code>S</code> as <code>S = xH = 8(mH) =
e</code>. Notice that this doesn’t only work for subgroups of order 8, but for any
small subgroup because it can always be rewritten as a multiple of the order.
For example, if <code>H</code> has order 4, <code>S = xH = 8(mH) = 4(2mH) = 1</code> and we get the
same identity element. If the provided point is in the prime order <code>r</code>
subgroup, then we get some other point in the subgroup and <em>not</em> the identity
element.</p>

<p>Because the identity element is in every subgroup (by definition of a group), we
can say that doing a scalar multiplication of this secret with an arbitrary
point from the group will result in an element in the prime order subgroup. In
practice, we may not actually want to allow the identity element and could
explicitly check this and reject the point if it was found, but this mitigates
the secret leakage that you would typically get which allows small-subgroup
attacks to be effective.</p>

<p><strong>So does this clearing matter for ed25519 signatures?</strong> Surprisingly, no! We
are always doing scalar multiplication against a publicly known generator from
a subgroup that we know has prime order. We never multiply our secrets by
arbitrary points. The reason why this is done is so that the same secrets could
be also be used safely with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748#section-5">X25519</a> if you also need to do a key-exchange.</p>

<p>For compatibility with the standard, libraries, and to make sure it’s still
safe to use with X25519 it’s a good idea to do this if you can, but it’s not
critical for the security of the signatures themself.</p>

<h3>Setting the highest bit</h3>

<p>Now we turn to the next part of clamping: clearing the 256th bit and setting the
255th to 1. The purpose of this is to ensure that the highest bit is always at
a fixed position. The first <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/11818">explanation was seen on StackOverflow in
2013</a> and later Daniel J. Bernstein (djb), the creator of ed25519,
explained in <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/pt2bt3fGQbNF8qdEcorp-rJSJrc/">a mailing list post from 2014</a>. I’ll expand on these here.</p>

<p>X25519 only deals in x-coordinates and there is a simple &amp; efficient way to
implement scalar multiplication of x-coordinates known as the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/293.pdf">Montgomery
ladder</a>. The problem with this is that some implementations implement
it in variable-time based on the position of the highest bit. To avoid
implementations having to care about this he decided to make this part of the
standard so that if the implementation is variable time in that way, it will
run in constant time because of this clamping. There are alternative ways to
make this constant time covered in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/293.pdf">Section 4.6.2</a>, but this is what
was chosen for ed25519.</p>

<p><strong>So does this bit-setting matter for ed25519 signatures?</strong> Again,
surprisingly, not really! In signatures we don’t use the Montgomery Ladder
because there are more efficient ways to do scalar multiplication with a fixed
point, and we always multiply by the known generator. From <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/293.pdf">BL17</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extensive research has produced a wide range of more complicated
scalar-multiplication methods (for pointers see, e.g., [BDL+11],[BCLS14], and
[BL16]), outperforming the Montgomery ladder for tasks such as computing n→nP for
a fixed point P, or computing nth multiples of points on certain special curves, but
the Montgomery ladder seems practically un-beatable for the core task of
computing n, P→nP on typical curves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An implementation <em>could</em> use the Montgomery ladder with y-coordinate recovery
but standard implementations will not. As with clearing the bits, we see yet
another choice made to protect against bad implementations or using the same
keys with X25519.</p>

<p>If you want to get into the weeds learning about the Montgomery ladder
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/293.pdf">BL17</a> and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/212.pdf">CS17</a> are good resources.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p>The designs of Curve25519, Ed25519, and X25519 are filled with choices to
optimize for security and implementation simplicity to avoid many types of
failures that were seen in practice before its design. The need for clamping
and rationale definitely fits the bill but it has been hard to find a detailed
explanation on the …</p></article></div>

        <article>
          <section><p>Operating systems and file systems have traditionally been developed
hand in hand. They impose mutual constraints on each other. Today we
have two major leaders in file system semantics: Windows and <span>POSIX</span>.
They are very close to each other when compared to the full set of
possibilities. Interesting things happened before POSIX monopolized
file system&nbsp;semantics.</p>

<p>When you use a file system through a library instead of going through
the operating system there are some extra possibilities. You are no
longer required to obey the host operating system’s semantics for
filenames. You get to decide if you use <code>/</code> or <code>\</code> to separate
directory components (or something else altogether). Maybe you don’t
even use strings for filenames. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/weinholt/fs-fatfs">fs-fatfs</a> library uses
a list of strings, so it’s up to the caller to define a directory
separator for themselves. While working on that library, I was driven
to write down some ideas that I’ve previously run across and found&nbsp;inspirational.</p>

<p>The very first hierarchical file system was developed for Multics. It
is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.multicians.org/fjcc4.html">A General-Purpose File System For Secondary Storage</a> (1965)
by Robert C. Daley and Peter G. Neumann. There are several things that I find
astounding about this&nbsp;paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were apparently no hierarchical file systems before Multics.
The references do no cite any previous work on this and I haven’t
found&nbsp;any.</li>
<li>Privacy in computing was a big consideration even back&nbsp;then.</li>
<li>Modern hierarchical file system are essentially unchanged from 1965,
but some features disappeared along the&nbsp;way.</li>
<li>There’s a <em>very</em> interesting backup system described in this&nbsp;paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper describes these concepts that we still use&nbsp;today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files.</li>
<li>Directories.</li>
<li>Root&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Working&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Tree name, i.e. the name of a file or directory in the tree
structure. Akin to&nbsp;realpath(3).</li>
<li>Path name, which is like a tree name, but it is conceptually
different because components can be links. The paper used <code>":"</code>
instead of <code>"/"</code> to separate&nbsp;directories.</li>
<li>Relative paths. They used an initial <code>":"</code> in place of <code>"./"</code> (or
empty) and <code>"*"</code> in place of <code>".."</code>. Instead of <code>"cd .."</code> you used
<code>"CHANGEDIRECTORY :*"</code>.</li>
<li>Symbolic&nbsp;links.</li>
<li>Access control using access control lists (showed up relatively
recently in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>).</li>
<li>Read, execute and write modes on files and directories. Execute
on a directory means permission to search it, just as in&nbsp;<span>POSIX</span>.</li>
<li>Segments and segment numbers (file descriptions and file
descriptors, respectively, if I’m not&nbsp;mistaken).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is said that Unix took inspiration from Multics and simplified
things. What was lost? Whoever implemented the file system for Unix
stopped reading the paper somewhere around subsection 2.3. There are
at least these features we’re&nbsp;missing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Access control lists can define a <span>TRAP</span> for a user. Users can refuse
to use TRAPs and instead get an error. Otherwise TRAPs call a named
function at the time of the access. They can be used to implement
smart files that can e.g. monitor file usage or apply password-based
file&nbsp;locks.</p>
<p>(Someone will undoubtedly insert eBPF into the Linux <span>VFS</span> soon and we
will have invented TRAPs&nbsp;again).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multics fully separated the append mode and the write mode and made
it available to users. You could actually have files and
<em>directories</em> that were writable but not appendable, or appendable
but not writable (or&nbsp;both).</p>
<p>(Append-only <em>files</em> exist on Linux through file attributes settable
by the super user or processes with <code>CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE</code>. This is
very weak sauce. Immutable directories exist, but not append-only
directories. And of course there is no way to have a writable file
or directory that can’t&nbsp;grow).</p>
</li>
<li>Directory entries that point to secondary storage. <em>This is a game
changer for file system management.</em> More on this&nbsp;below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-level-storage-and-backups">Multiple-level storage and&nbsp;backups</h2>
<p>Files in the Multics file system could have directory entries that
point to a secondary storage medium. At the time the secondary media
were tapes, but today they could be mechanical hard drives, <span>USB</span> drives
or network servers. But what is the point of having a file that isn’t
there? It’s really quite clever and it only gets more clever the more
you look at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>When a Multics system was running out of disk space it could remove
unused files from the primary medium, but keep the directory entries.</strong>
If you then tried to open such a file it would ask you to wait while
the file is being made available. It would issue instructions to the
operator (perhaps later a tape robot) to have them retrieve the
required tapes for restoring the file. Very useful when disks were
small and tapes were&nbsp;plentiful.</p>
<p>But it gets even better when you consider backups. Today if you need
to restore a Linux system from backups you do it this way: find the
oldest full backup and restore it, then restore each incremental
backup, going from oldest to newest. This means that the system can’t
be used until you’ve completely restored it from the backups. With
today’s disk sizes that could take a very, very long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Multics backups are done differently. To restore a completely hosed
system you first restore the system files, which will allow you to
boot. Then you restore the <em>latest</em> incremental backup. After this the
file system will contain the most current directory entries. <strong>Just
restore one incremental backup tape and all the files are already in
their right places. This is <em>much</em> faster than waiting for everything
to be&nbsp;restored!</strong></p>
<p>Why is only the latest incremental backup required to get everything
back in its place and working? The clever part is that the files might
not yet be on the disk. In fact, most files will probably be on
another backup medium. But the most recently used files have been
restored, so you can most likely do useful work already, and all other
files have their directory entries. If you try to open a file that
hasn’t been restored then you’re asked to wait and the operator is
told which tape to put in to get the file&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Is something like this offered on <em>any</em> <span>POSIX</span>-compatible file&nbsp;system?</p>

<p>The Xerox Alto was also a system of many firsts. It is most famous for
having the first windowing <span>GUI</span>, which inspired Apple’s design, which
then inspired Microsoft’s design. Of course it had a hierarchical file
system with version numbers, and even a network file&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>I would like to highlight the interesting disk structure of the Alto
file system, which is described in the
paper
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/an-open-operating-system-for-a-single-user-machine/">An Open Operating System for a Single-User Machine</a> (1979)
by Butler Lampson and Robert F.&nbsp;Sproull.</p>
<p>The designers of the system were concerned about data loss caused by
hardware issues and buggy software. They came up with a feature to
protect the user’s data against loss of any block on the disk. (Unless
the user data was in that lost block, of&nbsp;course).</p>
<p>All blocks on the disk have a label that contains these&nbsp;fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>A file&nbsp;identifier</li>
<li>A version&nbsp;number</li>
<li>A page number (block&nbsp;index)</li>
<li>A&nbsp;length</li>
<li>A next link (pointer to the next block in the&nbsp;file)</li>
<li>A previous&nbsp;link</li>
</ul>
<p>The label means that each block is self-identifying. By my count this
type of disk had an additional 14 bytes of label per each 512 byte&nbsp;block.</p>
<p><strong>If the disk structure is damaged then a special program called the
<em>scavenger</em> will iterate over all blocks and recover the structure.</strong>
Contrast this to a file system like ext4 where a damaged structure can
mean that huge swathes of data are rendered&nbsp;inaccessible.</p>
<p><strong>The scavenger was also used to upgrade the disk structure.</strong> Imagine
converting in-place between ext4, btrfs or <span>ZFS</span> by just running a
scavenger for the new disk structure. It would e.g. regard the
existing ext4 metadata as nonsense and build a new disk structure
based on btrfs by using the labels. (It will not work with these
specific file systems, but it demonstrates the&nbsp;principle).</p>
<p>Why don’t we have this today? Nobody wants to build a <span>POSIX</span> file
system that uses labels because the disks we’re using have 512-byte or
4096-byte blocks and no room for a label. A label would have a very
small overhead for each block, but even a very small overhead like
this is not acceptable to file system designers. More seriously, it
would mess up mmap(2). There are disks with slightly larger blocks
meant to store a label, but they are more expensive and not very
common. So we’re left with fragile file system structures and the sage
advice that you’re supposed to have backups anyway (for which, see
previous&nbsp;section).</p>
<p>The best modern alternative is something like Btrfs or <span>ZFS</span>. Blocks are
checksummed and those checksums are stored next to the pointers in the
disk structure. A modern version of the Alto file system should
certainly have checksums, but not using labels gives weaker
protections than what the Alto file system provided. If you want to
see how relevant the Alto file system design is today, just read what
using ZFS protects against, but then remember that it doesn’t use&nbsp;labels.</p>

<p>Hydra is another historical operating system with innovations in the
file system. It is described in the

<p>Hydra does away with the idea of ownership and a hierarchy of ever
more privileged components. It uses a fundamentally different concept
of protection and security than what <span>POSIX</span> is based&nbsp;on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technologists like hierarchical structures – they are elegant; but
experience from the real world shows they are not viable security
structures. The problem, then, which <span>HYDRA</span> attempts to face
squarely, is to maintain order in a nonhierarchical&nbsp;environment.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Resources that need protection, such as files, are called <em>objects</em>.
You can apply an <em>operation</em> to an object, such as reading or writing.
But to do so you need a reference to that object, which is called a
<em>capability</em>. You can even know a file’s identity, but without the
reference you can’t do&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>This is similar, but not identical, to a safe programming …</p></section></article></div></div></div>

As the next generation of the internet, the DWeb offers massive strides forward in terms of data autonomy, disaster and censorship resilience, performance, and speed — but for those who aren't yet familiar with it, using or building for the decentralized web can be time-consuming or difficult. Fleek's mission is to speed adoption of the DWeb by making it easier for everyone from dedicated developers to everyday internet users to create apps and store files in a decentralized paradigm, positioning them on the vanguard of a "low-code/no-code" movement of platforms, services, and development tools for users at all levels of coding experience.</p> <p>Fleek's product and service portfolio is built on the Fleek Stack of IPFS, <a href="https://textile.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Textile</a>, and <a href="https://filecoin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filecoin</a>, and deployed via Fleek Edge — infrastructure that combines the distributed peer-to-peer data sharing protocol of IPFS with edge computing to create an exceptionally fast and reliable distributed network. On Fleek Edge, data and information are processed and stored at edge locations geographically close to users' requests, reducing latency for real-time data applications and improving the performance and speed of peer-to-peer interactions.</p> <p>Fleek's service offerings — hosting, storage, and their new Space Daemon suite of developer tools — all utilize Fleek Edge, and can be used on their own or together as needed to put the power of IPFS's decentralized storage architecture into the hands of everyone from everyday internet users looking for file storage to more experienced developers who need low-friction tools for building on IPFS. With Fleek, anyone and everyone can use IPFS to join the decentralized web. For the Fleek team, it's IPFS that makes the DWeb possible, and Fleek wants to make IPFS easier, faster, and more streamlined for everyone.</p> <h3 id="fleek-by-the-numbers"><a href="#fleek-by-the-numbers">#</a> Fleek by the numbers</h3> <div><div><p>&gt;8K</p> <p>IPFS site deployments</p></div><div><p>&gt;8K</p> <p>Fleek URLs and DNSLink records</p></div><div><p>99.99%</p> <p>guaranteed uptime on Fleek Edge</p></div><div><p>150+</p> <p>global Fleek Edge locations</p></div></div> <h2 id="the-story"><a href="#the-story">#</a> The story</h2> <p>Fleek started life as Terminal.co with a simple mission: Build tools that make using the Dweb easier for everyone in order to fuel a faster, more seamless transition from the centralized web of today to the decentralized web of the future. To that end, the team originally launched with a focus on user-friendly tools for building decentralized apps (dapps) interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</p> <p>But Fleek soon realized that starting with dapps was putting the cart before the horse. Not only is building for dapps and smart contracts a specialized market, but these products themselves are only ever as decentralized as the storage architecture upon which they rely. To truly guide the web's transition to a decentralized future, the team needed a broader approach. That's when Fleek turned to IPFS as the technology that would help them make their vision a reality.</p> <div><p><strong>"We saw that the fastest, simplest, and most direct way to advance the decentralized web is to equip ordinary web users with the tools they need to access and build on IPFS. IPFS offers the data integrity, privacy, and security that we think matter most for the future of the DWeb. And with the right tools, we knew we could give a full hosting experience and seamless workflow — making IPFS as easy to use as a standard website today."</strong></p> <p><em>— Brett Shear, COO, Fleek</em></p></div> <p>The Fleek team decided to pursue a new company direction, with a product roadmap geared toward boosting the accessibility of IPFS-based hosting, storage, and database management. That decision spurred development of an entirely new platform — the Fleek Stack of IPFS, Textile, and (after mainnet launch) Filecoin — with a debut in early 2020.</p> <p>Fleek currently offers three products built on the Fleek Stack, each intended to enhance and streamline the workflow around common DWeb use cases:</p> <ul><li><strong>Fleek Hosting:</strong> Tools for hosting sites and apps on IPFS, including industry-familiar continuous integration and deployment tooling via GitHub.</li> <li><strong>Fleek Storage:</strong> A service for importing, storing, pinning, and fetching files via IPFS that includes a friendly UI in addition to API and CLI interfaces.</li> <li><strong>Space Daemon:</strong> A developer toolset for building peer-to-peer encrypted apps that packages IPFS, Textile Threads and Buckets, and Filecoin into a single JavaScript interface.</li></ul> <p>Each of these products is designed to facilitate IPFS use and integration in as streamlined a manner as possible. Space Daemon, for example, makes it simple for users to leverage IPFS for encrypted database storage and serverless app development. Fleek's hosting and storage offerings automatically handle the IPFS-specific details by auto-updating references to content identifiers (CIDs), TXT values in DNS records, and more.</p> <p>In creating this streamlined workflow for using, building upon, and deploying to IPFS, Fleek empowers developers to integrate the protocol's key benefits — such as peer-to-peer functionality, serverless interactions, and autonomy from centralized hosting — into their sites, products, and apps. What's more, the Fleek Edge network provides significant performance and efficiency boosts that anyone from DWeb newcomers to IPFS veterans can benefit from.</p> <p>In short, Fleek's portfolio offers wide-ranging functionality and a bridge between the legacy web and the DWeb, facilitating many valuable use cases across the end-user and developer space. "One of the biggest barriers to adoption of IPFS by the broader web community is unfamiliarity with the manual work involved in hosting or building on IPFS," says Shear. "Fleek takes care of that work on its own, which ensures that anyone who wants the benefits of hosting their website on IPFS can get them easily and quickly. But even experienced devs can benefit from the ease of use and faster speeds they get with Fleek products deployed on Fleek Edge."</p> <h2 id="ipfs-benefits"><a href="#ipfs-benefits">#</a> IPFS benefits</h2> <p>Fleek chose IPFS because it decentralizes two of the core aspects of the internet: file storage and data transfer. Combined with the inherent advantages of IPFS content addressing and IPFS's position as a fundamental technology in Filecoin, this opens up a host of benefits not available elsewhere:</p> <ul><li><strong>Data integrity in a peer-to-peer world:</strong> Fleek uses IPFS in combination with encryption tools like Textile's, enabling them to offer a best-of-both-worlds paradigm where users get the benefits of client-side encryption (through user-owned keys) as well as the ability to share data directly without touching any third-party servers. Because the transport is encrypted by default, external watchers can't view it in transit, and IPFS's <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">content addressing</a> also ensures that the data a user receives when they make a request is cryptographically verified as the data they asked for.</li> <li><strong>Censorship and disaster reslilience:</strong> IPFS content addressing allows for multiple copies of the same content-addressed resource to exist as equivalent items in multiple locations worldwide. This can offer the potential for a degree of resilience against physical disaster or censorship unavailable on the legacy web.</li> <li><strong>Integrated access to future storage and retrieval markets:</strong> Because IPFS and Filecoin are so tightly integrated, building on IPFS will facilitate the ability to offer Fleek users a seamless way to access the Filecoin marketplace for their storage needs.</li></ul> <p>Additionally, IPFS's vibrant and active community of developers means that the protocol is constantly evolving to better meet the needs of its users and builders.</p> <h2 id="how-fleek-uses-ipfs"><a href="#how-fleek-uses-ipfs">#</a> How Fleek uses IPFS</h2> <p>Fleek creates a simple, streamlined workflow for anyone looking to host, share, or build content on the decentralized web. Fleek provides its own public IPFS gateway, which means that developers don't need to build their own in order to serve their users. The gateway allows even IPFS-ignorant legacy web browsers and apps to access content provided via IPFS.</p> <p>Fleek also automates the process of building and deploying on IPFS. Developers who use Fleek for site and app deployments don't need to do anything except link Fleek with a GitHub repo, and Fleek will automatically build and deploy their code via IPFS.</p> <p>So, what does that look like in action? Since IPFS uses content addressing, every piece of content on IPFS needs its own unique content identifier (CID). This CID is updated with every change to the content with which it is associated. For developers, keeping up with these updates can be a hassle, since it would normally involve manually updating CID pointers or implementing other downstream changes to match a new CID.</p> <p>Fleek handles all that manual work on its own. In the case of a website, Fleek automatically takes the CID generated by IPFS for the site content and points it to a Fleek subdomain URL, using a TXT record added to the DNS settings Fleek creates for the site. Whenever anyone visits that Fleek URL, the most recently associated CIDs are delivered to the user via Fleek's HTTP IPFS gateway — meaning that a request that starts with an HTTP request (such as a legacy web browser) remains HTTP throughout. And any time site content changes, Fleek automatically detects the new hash and re-associates the TXT record accordingly.</p> <p>In short, a developer on Fleek can use familiar tools and workflows without worrying about the manual work that might normally go into using IPFS — while still taking advantage of the benefits provided by the decentralized web.</p> <h3 id="the-tooling"><a href="#the-tooling">#</a> The tooling</h3> <p>At the core of all of Fleek's offerings are <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>go-ipfs</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>ipfs-http-client</code></a>, used out of the box. Nodes on <code>go-ipfs</code> appear throughout the Fleek ecosystem, including:</p> <ul><li>Pinning nodes used by Fleek Hosting and Fleek Storage</li> <li>Nodes for encrypted backups</li> <li>Space Daemon-specific nodes (behind Textile Hub)</li></ul> <p>Platform-wide,…</p></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>Perhaps you are a skilled technologist. But beware: If your personality is as scintillating as a dish rag, you could jeopardize your open source projects.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8935389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent study</a>, a developer’s personality could significantly impact their contributions to open source projects. The researchers at the University of Waterloo found that social factors, including experience, remain the most influential factors in whether a contributor’s work is accepted or rejected. But the study also found that personality traits play a key role in how their work is perceived.</p>
<p>“People who voluntarily work on open source projects need to be aware of how open they are to change and how conscientious they are, as these two personality traits will impact how willing people are to work with them,” says Meiyappan Nagappan, a professor in Waterloo’s David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science and a co-author of the study, <a href="https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=256663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in&nbsp; a statement.</a></p>
<p>Nobody works in a vacuum. A person’s behavior comes out <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">when they interact with other people</a>, whether it’s in person, in a Slack channel, or in code comments. Software development often involves <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/4-lessons-software-teams-can-learn-from-rock-bands/">creating a team where it’s comfortable and safe to share ideas</a>. As the researchers note, it’s not enough to complete a task; developers also need to listen and consider other people’s opinions with an open mind. In fact, some developers say, the more diverse personalities on a team, the better the end product.</p>
<p>The researchers collected their data from GitHub. They analyzed the personality traits of 16,935 active developers from 1,860 projects. Each developer had at least 250 pull requests, the process by which GitHub developers notify other open source contributors working on the same project that they completed a task.</p>
<p>The researchers then used the IBM Watson Personality Insights to retrieve the big five personalities of the software developers in GitHub: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.</p>
<p>“We found that social factors are still more important than technical factors in getting your open source work accepted,” says Alex Yun, a master’s student in Waterloo’s faculty of mathematics and another study co-author, in a statement.</p>
<p>The researchers also examined the importance of personality factors. They found that biases may be involved in the acceptance or rejection of open source work. That’s true despite the apparent advantage of open source whereby you can contribute with a level of anonymity; your persona shows in your code and comments. Someone reviews and comments on your work based on what they see in front of them, and not how they know you as a person.</p>
<p>“Managers are more likely to accept a contribution from someone they know, or someone more agreeable than others – even though the technical contribution might be similar,” Yun says.</p>
<h3>Developers are not surprised</h3>
<p>People who work in the open source community agree with the research findings.</p>
<p>“If your work is being reviewed and you immediately shoot down any suggestions made by others, I could then foresee this negatively impacting the views of the decision makers who merge your work,” observes Matthew Arnold, a senior software engineer at global call intelligence provider <a href="https://www.infinity.co/us/">Infinity</a>.</p>
<p>“What’s the adjective for the furthest thing from ‘surprised’? Because whatever that word is describes my reaction to this research finding,’’ says VM (Vicky) Brasseur, an open source leader, speaker, and author of the book, <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/vbopens/forge-your-future-with-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge Your Future With Open Source.</a> “While the research phrases it academically as ‘personality,’ what they mean is someone’s ability to interact with others: <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">the application of social interaction skills</a> as well as technical skills.”</p>
<p>Those with an extroverted personality likely find it easier to hit “submit” when sending pull requests to open source repositories, Arnold adds. “By submitting this pull request, you’re agreeing to let the internet community review and judge your work. That can be quite daunting, especially when open source projects often attract some of the finest minds in the industry.’’</p>
<p>To some degree, each of us can assess our own capabilities – for good or ill. Arnold’s personality falls into the introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging (INTJ) personality type within the Myers-Briggs personality assessment. He considers himself to be open and conscientious. But we may see ourselves with a different perspective than do outsiders.</p>
<p>Personality traits have <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">some impact on software development</a>, but social factors are more influential, says Dawn Foster, director of <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/opensource">Open Source Community Strategy</a> &nbsp;at VMware. “In my experience, the social factors have had a bigger impact on my ability to successfully contribute to open source projects.”</p>
<p>Foster describes herself as “primarily conscientious with a bit of agreeableness,” which she says has served her well because &nbsp;she is usually prepared and detail oriented. This “allows people to feel more comfortable relying on me to perform my duties.” Being agreeable helps her empathize with others and make them feel welcome, she says.</p>
<h3>Social factors carry more weight</h3>
<p>Both Foster and Brasseur agree with the Waterloo study finding that social factors are more influential on the likelihood of pull request acceptance of contributions into open source projects.</p>
<p>“Open source communities often feel like very small worlds where I keep running into the same people over and over again,’’ Foster explains. “My past social interactions in previous communities have helped smooth the way for my participation in new ones.”</p>
<p>For example, when Foster started contributing to Kubernetes, she wanted to help out with the Contributor Summit. Because she had worked with several of the organizers on other projects who could vouch for her work, it was relatively easy for her to get involved as an organizer despite being relatively new to the project.</p>
<p>Another example the <a href="https://chaoss.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHAOSS Project</a> where Foster eventually joined its governing board. “Because many of the existing board members and maintainers knew of my past work on open source project health metrics, it allowed me to participate in meaningful ways much more quickly than I might have if I didn’t have those previous social interactions,” Foster says.</p>
<p>Brasseur points out that social interaction is critical not just to a successful open source contribution – but to any endeavor that involves more than one person.</p>
<p>“Collaboration is difficult if not impossible when people aren’t able to interact well, whether due to personal skills, language differences, or some other obstruction,’’ Brasseur says. “We in open source have abundant documentation about the technical aspects of contributing, such as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/16-things-that-testers-wished-theyd-learned-earlier/">writing tests</a> or the mechanics of sending your contribution for review, but relatively little about the social expectations for that contribution.”</p>
<p>Projects don’t necessarily ignore the social expectations, Brasseur adds. “It’s simply that they rarely document them.”</p>
<p>Like Foster, Arnold says that being open, conscientious, and agreeable has benefited him professionally. These traits have helped him to “gel well with teammates, which to me is a massive benefit.” But, he adds, “I have to be careful, however, that I don’t let this cloud my judgement when receiving feedback around changing how I have done something. I need to make sure I’m not too quick to go with what makes the other person happy.”</p>
<p>The result is a willingness to accept suggestions that go against his initial view. “My impediments tend to come from a lack of extroversion along with levels of neuroticism,” Arnold says, “making experiences such as presenting and training a lot more stressful and anxiety inducing than they necessarily need be.”</p>
<p>Don’t expect arguments. Most developers are agreeable! “The times that I see a pull request being hindered most by personality are when you have a small pool of developers reviewing the work,” Arnold says. In those cases, “The author is implementing review comments without really critiquing the suggestions, which can sometimes cause a reduced level of quality.”</p>
<h3>Being a good communicator speaks volumes</h3>
<p>Someone who is a good communicator always is in demand. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/so-you-want-to-become-a-software-qa-professional/">Employers are always looking for that soft skill</a> in candidates across industries, says Lusen Mendel, director of developer relations at <a href="https://karat.com/">Karat</a>, which conducts technical interviews for organizations hiring developers.</p>
<p>“Just as <a href="https://www.functionize.com/acceptance-testing-a-step-by-step-guide/">we validate software correctness with tests</a>, it often takes bouncing ideas off a peer to validate the degree of our own understanding and the effectiveness of our insights,’’ Mendel says. “Being a good, concise communicator lets developers quickly identify what information is salient to specific brainstorms, decisions, and open source projects.”</p>
<p>In virtually every interview Karat conducts,&nbsp;regardless of what they were&nbsp;supposed to be evaluating, “Interviewers inevitably tell the hiring manager how the candidate communicated,’’ he notes.</p>
<h3>More change is needed</h3>
<p>While he is not a developer, Jack Wallen, who has covered open source for decades as a journalist, finds that “Developers are very much like artists, in that they can be very sensitive to criticism and place a very high value not only on their work, but on the acceptance of both their work and who they are.”</p>
<p>Many developers pride themselves on their individuality and tend to hold that trait very dear, Wallen says. “That can translate to either being very satisfied with a project, when they and their work are accepted – or walking away when they are not.”</p>
<p>For Wallen, there is another longstanding issue in the development community that needs to be addressed. “It’s become clear that there needs to be significant improvement in the way the development community treats people of color, women, and members of the LGBTQ community,” he says. “At this point, there must be a zero tolerance for unwanted or unequal treatment.”</p>
<p>Wallen says he knows very talented developers who have been affected by this. “And …</p></div></div>

  				<p>August 2020</p>
            <p>I’ve long held the belief that, to build a lending business that is differentiated and sustainable, you need at least 3 of 4 things:
            </p><ul>
                <li>Pre-income servicing: a way for the lender to get paid synchronously with, or before the borrower. </li>
<li>Proprietary data that others don’t have, that helps predict:
<ul>
<li>(more useful) the borrower’s ability to pay, and</li>
<li>(less useful) the borrower’s willingness to pay,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lower cost of borrower acquisition than competitors lending to that same borrower </li>
<li>Lower cost of capital than competitors lending to that same borrower. This enables the lender to 
<ul>
    <li>profitably lend to the same borrowers at lower interest rates than competitors</li>
<li>expand margins by lending to the same customers at par vs. competitors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>

I came around to this framework watching Square Capital from afar. From the start Square Capital had 3 of the 4 on the list (and from the outside looking in I think Stripe, Shopify, Amazon, and Paypal probably have (or have had) similar dynamics playing out).
</p>
<h3>Pre-Income Servicing</h3>
            <p>Because Square Capital lends primarily to Square merchants and can intercept the merchant’s credit card payment receipts, they have pre-income servicing; they get paid at the same time (or before) the merchant gets paid. In Capital's case, Square gets paid when the merchant gets paid, directly out of the merchant's payment card receipts. Consequently, instead of depending on the merchant’s willingness and ability to pay, Capital primarily depends on the merchant’s ability to pay; as long as the merchant remains in business <i>and</i> continues to process payments with Square, Capital continues to get paid back.
    </p>
    <p>In Square’s case, this access to the borrowers cash flow has similar dynamics to collateralized lending. In collateralized lending you have recourse to the borrowers current liquidity; pre-income servicing gives you recourse to the borrowers future liquidity. There may be other types of pre-income servicing, but this is what I’ve observed so far, and I think it applies to Stripe and Paypal as well. The best corollary for this in the consumer realm is payroll services (in the case of W2 workers) and gig economy services (in the case of 1099 workers). I wouldn't be suprised if, in the coming years, Gusto, Zenefits and Rippling launch consumer lending products. There are probably meaningful regulatory hurdles to cross, but it doesn't feel impossible. 
    </p>
    
    <p>In the case of 1099 workers this is slightly more complex. I remember <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/loans-from-uber/">seeing an Uber loan product a while back </a>. Gig economy platforms, unlike payroll systems, have the ability to actually improve the quality of a loan; that is, Uber could lend money to a driver, and then funnel more rides (or more lucrative rides) to that driver, thus speeding up their payback and improving loan quality. No idea if they're doing this, but it's a lever that purely financial platforms don't have, that gig economy platforms do have.
    
    </p>
    <h3>Proprietary data driven underwriting</h3>
    <p>
        Square Capital has access to a ton of high quality data about a merchant. The longer the merchant is on Square, the better the data, and it includes (but is not limited to); business location, payment velocity, customer demographics, customer spend across other Square merchants, cash flow, etc. It’s like extending a loan to a borrower whose entire history with you has been their loan application, and they’ve been applying for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In many ways underwriting a merchant (or any business) is underwriting their underlying customer quality. An advantage Capital has in addition to lots of data on the merchant, is lots of data on the merchant’s customers; their behavior across Square’s network of sellers, their various credit and debit cards, how frequently they visit that merchant, which other merchants they visit, and how likely they are to dispute a transaction. This type of data about a merchants <i>ability to pay</i> is relatively unique to merchant processors (such as Square/Stripe/Paypal); I can imagine other B2B2C platforms, given the right depth of end customer data, can develop similar quality lending programs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One bit of nuance here; it is technically true that a 3rd party lender could oauth into Square or Stripe via APIs and get access to that merchant's transaction data, and use that data to underwrite. However, it's extremely unlikely that the true depth of data that Square or Stripe has about that merchant will ever be available via API; this is not necessarily malicious or defensive; it's just that APIs embed tradeoffs like any other product, and all the underlying systems that these companies use generate <i>some data</i>, the full breadth of which might not be available for a 3rd party developer to access. For Square and Stripe, that data included everything in the auth stream, every datapoint previously ingested to underwrite fraud, and the underlying DNA to interpret and act on those signals along the way. From this vantage point I think that for the same borrower, Stripe has something of an advantage over Shopify, both because fraud underwriting DNA will be more native to Stripe, and because Stripe has a greater depth of access to the borrowers financial data than Shopify. All that being said, no idea what they've agreed to share.
        </p>
        <p>
            One trap that I see from time to time; just because your data is proprietary, does not mean it's predictive for underwriting purposes. Tools like FICO and credit reports have been used &amp; seasoned over trillions of dollars of lending instruments over decades, so the bar for a proprietary dataset to be useful for underwriting is pretty high. In the Square Capital case (and again I think true for Stripe, Paypal, Amazon, and Shopify) Square wasn't founded with the intent to eventually lend money; the expertise and dataset happened to be highly applicable to lending. That's not going to be true for every proprietary dataset, and in large part its hard to know in advance if your dataset will improve underwriting.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are probably ways to get data about a borrower's willingness to pay, but I think it is strictly less useful than data about their ability to pay. How willing you are to pay back a loan is irrelevant if you're insolvent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, proprietary data is necessary but not sufficient; just because you have different/proprietary data than other lenders, doesn’t mean your data is predictive of a borrower’s ability or willingness to pay.  
        </p>
    
    <h3>Lower cost of borrower acquisition</h3>
    <p>
        Capital doesn’t have to acquire customers because Square’s already doing that upstream, for its Point of sale, payments, appointments and other product lines. This translates to higher margin per borrower relative to a lender that has to originally acquire the borrower themselves.

    </p>
    <p>
        There are a few secondary consequences for lending products when the borrower has been acquired upstream. First, as the underlying product gets better, you’re likely to improve the borrower’s quality overall; if the tooling Square provides you improves your marketing, lowers your costs, or frees up bandwidth, you’re likely to be a better borrower than might have been indicated by the data upfront, or a better borrower than you might have been for the same loan amount, for the exact same business, on another platform. In addition, if those improvements are real, the underlying Square product is likely stickier for you, making you less likely to leave, and marginally more likely to pay. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Second, the few companies I can think of started as something else and bolted on lending; the original, underlying products are pretty strong all by themselves, and the teams recognized a working capital need and stepped in to fill it. Genuinely not sure how to interpret this, but my current read is that many high quality lending businesses in the future, are being built today as something else (Square &amp; Stripe built as PSPs before going into lending, Shopify being built as a merchant services company, etc).
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, when you already have a relationship with that potential borrower, you can create push based acquisition tactics. This means inviting an extremely targeted group of borrowers to apply for a loan, where all their details are already prefilled. This is in contrast with a 3rd party lender saying "send us your Square data and we'll underwrite you."
    </p>
    <p>
        I think one reason many tech enabled lenders in the last decade have struggled is that many of them have at best 2 of the 4, and in many cases the 2 they have are not truly sustainable. Lending Club for example really only had the lower CAC advantage because they were one of the first to lend online. They used functionally the same data that Chase had access to (FICO &amp; proof of income) and they got paid the same way Chase did. Even the lower CAC advantage wasn’t sustainable - every lender that aspires to scale today is lending online, and in many cases they’re crowding the same channels (paid Google and Facebook ads in a lot of cases).

    </p>
    <h3>        The last leg: Lower cost of capital</h3>
    <p>
The primary way to have a low cost of capital is to have deposits as your capital base, which removes 3rd party banks/investors and their requisite financial hurdle rates from your cost structure. Until a few months ago, this was the domain entirely of traditional banks, and no technology company or tech enabled lender had been able to compete on cost of capital. A few events over the last few months have changed this:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/ilc-update">The Square ILC Charter</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lendingclub-in-process-of-acquiring-radius-bank-2020-2"> Lending Club acquiring Radius</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.varomoney.com/press_release/fdic-approval-moves-varo-to-final-stage-of-bank-charter-journey/">The Varo Money Charter</a></li>
</ul><p>

These changes are different paths to the same thing; the ability to collect deposits, either from consumers or businesses. Time will tell how these organizations …</p></div></div>

          <section>
            
<div>
<h2>Introduction - why use a subscriptions management/recurring billing software</h2>
<p>When working on a SaaS such as <b>﻿<a href="https://www.dynablogger.com/" target="_blank">DynaBlogger</a></b>, one obvious thing you'll need to implement at some point - well, if you want to get paid for it! - is&nbsp;<b>﻿subscriptions management</b>﻿ with&nbsp;<b>﻿recurring billing</b>﻿. At a minimum, you need to use a&nbsp;<b>﻿payment gateway</b>﻿ such as&nbsp;<b>﻿<a>Stripe</a></b><a></a>&nbsp;or similar if you build everything yourself. Stripe is likely the most popular gateway among developers thanks to great APIs and documentation, and is pretty easy to integrate with an existing app. It has some limits though. It's a payment gateway at its core, meaning that other features like subscriptions management - while available with <b><a href="https://stripe.com/billing" target="_blank">Stripe Billing</a></b> - are somewhat limited. Besides, if you use Stripe with your app you have a limited choice of payment methods unless you implement something like <b>PayPal</b>﻿ or others alongside Stripe.</p>
<p>I also don't like the idea of having both recurring payments and subscriptions management with a single provider. I've read a few stories of people who've seen their accounts suspended or closed, so it's a risk in my opinion.</p>
<p>For these reasons I decided to use Stripe as payment gateway only, and use something else to manage subscriptions, namely&nbsp;<b>﻿<a href="https://www.chargebee.com/" target="_blank">Chargebee</a></b>﻿. It's an awesome service with a ton of powerful features that make managing subscriptions and recurring billing a lot easier. <b><a href="https://www.chargebee.com/docs/" target="_blank">Documentation</a></b> is extensive (although it could be improved in a few areas), the app is pretty easy to integrate with your own app and support is just great - I've contacted them several times and each time I had friendly and helpful responses without waiting too much. Also, PayPal didn't want to enable "reference transactions"&nbsp;for me which are required by Chargebee - if I understand it correctly it is for recurring payments - because my account is new. Chargebee contacted them on my behalf and PayPal enabled reference transactions for me right away! Really impressive. I think their customer service/support is the best I have experienced so far.</p>
<p>Chargebee also offers a&nbsp;<i>﻿Launch</i>﻿ plan which is totally free of charge until you reach $50K&nbsp;(or €45K) in revenue. After that, it switches to a $99/mo plan automatically with some overcharge if your revenue goes above 25K/mo. There are bigger plans of course that scale with your revenue and offer additional features. Stripe Billing might be cheaper (with only a small transaction fee on top of the gateway fee) but like I said, it's limited in comparison and it has a long way to catch up at the moment. But knowing that with Chargebee I can use multiple gateways and switch between them easily makes the choice even easier for me. There are many other subscriptions management/recurring billing services available, but I prefer Chargebee because of the better balance between pricing and features.</p>
<p>You might still be wondering why use something like Chargebee vs building out subscriptions and recurring billing yourself, for example with Stripe directly. Besides the limitations I already mentioned about building with Stripe, there's quite a bit of development effort involved if you do everything yourself. With Rails you can use the&nbsp;<b>﻿<a>pay gem</a></b><a></a>&nbsp;by Chris Oliver - the awesome guy who runs the popular e-learning platform for Rails devs&nbsp;<b>﻿<a>GoRails</a></b><a></a>&nbsp;- to make your life easier. Chris also sells a comprehensive course that teaches you how to integrate recurring payments etc from scratch if you want.</p>
<p>I actually bought the course, but I decided to go with Chargebee. It's a much better solution than whatever I might build myself in a short time since I wanted to launch soon. With Chargebee it's mostly a set and forget thing. You just configure plans and all the rest and don't need to worry about keeping your payments features in sync with new regulations and such. There's a very little coding involved.</p>

<h2>Integrating Chargebee with a Rails app - checkout for a new subscription</h2>
<p>Chargebee is pretty easy to integrate with a Rails app. You can still build everything yourself using their API&nbsp;similarly to Stripe (in which case you would still benefit from the many more features), but the easiest way is to use their hosted pages for checkout and subscription management. There's the option of an "<a href="https://www.chargebee.com/docs/checkout.html" target="_blank">in-app checkout</a>" that literally takes a couple of lines of code at a minimum (one script and a link to open the checkout in a modal - same thing for the self service portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The in-app checkout, out of the box, requires the user to enter all their information including name, email alongside billing address and payment method, so it's good if you want to delegate account management to Chargebee. In my case, I prefer managing accounts in my app since I have a lot more control, so what I do when I need to open the checkout is first make an API&nbsp;call that generates a unique checkout URL&nbsp;with the customer's account details already, together with the plan the user wants to subscribe to. Then with the Chargebee JavaScript library I open this URL in the modal iframe and the user can quickly subscribe to the selected plan. Same thing for the self service portal:&nbsp;an API&nbsp;call to create a unique URL for the user and then this URL is opened in a modal as well. From there, the user can update payment method and billing details, cancel the subscription etc. Chargebee allows some basic customisation of the in-app checkout and portal so they look good in your own app.</p>
<p>The very first thing you'd need to do before we jump into the code, is of course create a Chargebee account. This will give you a test site that you can use for development and - when you activate it - a live site which you will use for production. There's quite a bit of configuration you can do in Chargebee to make it work exactly as you wish, and one awesome thing is that you can quickly copy selected configuration settings from the test site to the live site, so you don't have to reconfigure everything from scratch for production.</p>
<p>So go ahead, create a Chargebee account and configure at least some plans, and whatever else you like. In the test environment you can use a fake payment gateway provided by Chargebee and already configured.</p>
<p>Let's see how the actual integration can be done now.</p>

<p>To begin with, add the Chargebee gem to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`:</p>
<pre><code>gem 'chargebee', '~&gt; 2.7', '&gt;= 2.7.5'</code></pre>
<p>Then create an initializer in&nbsp;<i>﻿config/initializers/chargebee.rb</i>﻿ and configure API&nbsp;access:</p>
<pre><code>ChargeBee.configure(site: Settings.chargebee_site, api_key: Settings.chargebee_api_key)</code></pre>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>﻿site</i>﻿ is the sub domain created for you when you signed up, and you can find the API&nbsp;key in the Chargebee configuration.<i></i></p>
<p>Before you continue, fire up the Rails console and ensure the API can be consumed correctly:</p>
<pre><code>ChargeBee::Plan.list</code></pre>
<p>You should get the list of the plans you've created earlier.</p>
<p>Next, we need a class that we'll use to create the unique URLs for checkout and portal together with a few other things. I keep this in&nbsp;<i>﻿app/models/charge_bee/client.rb</i>﻿. Let's start with the method that creates the URL for the in-app checkout:</p>
<pre><code>class ChargeBee::Client
  def self.checkout_new(user:, plan_id:)
    result = ChargeBee::HostedPage.checkout_new({
      subscription: { 
        plan_id: plan_id
      },
      customer: { 
        first_name: user.first_name,
        last_name: user.last_name,
        email: user.email,
        cf_environment: Rails.env.to_s
      },
      embed: false,
      redirect_url: redirect_url
    })

    result.hosted_page
  end  

  private

    def self.redirect_url
      Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.subscription_url
    end

end</code></pre>
<p>This method expects a user (or other billable model in your app), and the ID&nbsp;of a plan you configured in Chargebee. We pass this plan ID&nbsp;with the subscription options, and also pass the name and email of the user/customer so that they don't have to enter this information in the checkout manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, we are also setting&nbsp;<i>﻿cf_environment</i>﻿ to the current Rails environment. There's a reason for this:&nbsp;whenever something happens in Chargebee (a subscription is created or updated and things like that), Chargebee fires an asynchronous event that is sent to one or more webhooks you specify in the configuration. You can configure multiple webhooks, but you only have one test site, so if your app has a development and a staging environments for example, you need a means to tell apart events generated by each so the webhook endpoint knows which events to process, ignoring events that are for another environment.&nbsp;<i>﻿cf_environment</i>﻿ doesn't exist yet, you need to create a&nbsp;<b>﻿custom field</b>﻿ with that name in&nbsp;Chargebee's configuration.</p>
<p><i>﻿embed</i>﻿ must be set to&nbsp;<i>﻿false</i>﻿ if you want to use the recommended modal checkout, otherwise Chargebee expects that the checkout page be opened in an iframe.&nbsp;<i>﻿redirect_url</i>﻿ is the URL you want Chargebee to redirect the user to when the checkout is complete. What the API&nbsp;call returns is a&nbsp;<i>﻿HostedPage</i>﻿ object which must be returned in JSON format to the Chargebee JavaScript library so that it can open the checkout in a modal.<i>﻿</i></p>
<p>Next, add the following route to your&nbsp;<i>﻿routes.rb</i>﻿:</p>
<pre><code>get "/checkout/new/:plan_id" =&gt; "charge_bee#checkout_new"</code></pre>
<p>This expects a controller which we'll create in&nbsp;<i>﻿app/controllers/charge_bee_controller.rb</i>﻿:</p>
<pre><code>class ChargeBeeController &lt; ApplicationController
  def checkout_new
    result = ChargeBee::Client.checkout_new(
      user: current_user, plan_id: params[:plan_id]
    )

    render json: result
  end
end</code></pre>
<p>So we just use the class we created earlier and return the JSON of the checkout hosted page for the given plan and user.</p>
<p>Now add the Chargebee script to your&nbsp;<i>﻿appllication.html.erb</i>﻿ or equivalent layout:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script …</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>Nobody wakes up in the morning excited to deal with a SOC 2 audit, but completing one will help your company grow and close larger deals faster. SOC 2 covers <em>a lot</em>, and it’s not just an engineering checkmark - but if you’re a developer at a not-huge company going through SOC 2 compliance, chances are you’ll need to get involved. This guide will cover everything you need to know from a technical perspective, from basic access controls to encrypting data at rest. <em>‍</em></p><p><em>(Note: this guide is NOT a comprehensive assessment of what you’ll need to pass SOC 2 compliance, nor is it legal advice. The goal here is just to help developers understand what they’ll need to do to make sure that tech and infrastructure aren’t holding things up.)</em></p><h2>What SOC 2 is and why it's important</h2><p><em>SOC 2</em> is a certification – an objective third party checking your company out – developed by the AICPA, one of the big “governing bodies” of accountants in the U.S (riveting, I know). The way it works is that you hire an auditor to investigate how secure and trustworthy your company is, fill in any holes they identify, and then they certify you as SOC 2 compliant. Once you’ve passed an audit, you can display the SOC 2 logo on your site, tell your customers and leads that you’re compliant, and close those bigger deals. </p><p>The important thing about SOC 2 is that it’s not just a stamp for giant enterprises - like <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">SSO</a> and <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-directory-sync-scim">Directory Sync</a>, even fast growing startups are starting to require more advanced security measures before engaging with vendors. And as we’ll see in a bit, most of what you’ll need to work on to be SOC 2 compliant overlaps a lot with engineering best practices anyway. So if you’re considering whether SOC 2 compliance is worth it for your company, it might be a realistic fit earlier than you think - and help you stand out to potential customers.</p><p>Now if you’re thinking that SOC 2 implies the existence of a SOC 1, you’d be right, but SOC 1 is a lot less popular among SaaS startups. It’s generally a lower lift certification and doesn’t meet the security requirements that those larger deals are looking for. There’s also a SOC 3, but same story here - generally not the focus for the customers you’re trying to woo. SOC 2 is the big one.</p><p>So what exactly are these auditors looking for? What makes your company SOC 2 compliant? The answer, weirdly enough, is that criteria are subjective and company-specific - the auditor you work with will put together a plan. Generally, they’re looking for a few things:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>There’s quality <strong>oversight of the company</strong> as a whole (performance reviews, independent voices, background checks, etc.)</li><li>The <strong>SDLC</strong> (software development lifecycle) is transparent, trackable, and controlled (issue tracking, unit testing, version control, etc.)</li><li>Your <strong>application and underlying infrastructure</strong> are secure and monitored (encryption, logging, APM, vulnerability scans, etc.)</li><li>You’ve implemented <strong>access controls</strong> for internal services and SaaS (de-provisioning accounts, 2FA, malware detection, etc.)</li></ul><p>If a lot of these examples look familiar to you, it’s because you’ve probably already implemented them. The good news about SOC 2 is that as it relates to engineering, the requirements are generally pretty agreeable and a lot of modern SWE orgs already have issue tracking, review pipelines, vulnerability checks, and a good amount of the remaining checks auditors will be looking for. </p><p>We’ll dive into the SDLC, app and infrastructure, access controls, and then take a look at how you can save time with pre-built software like <a href="https://www.vanta.com/">Vanta</a> that takes care of a lot of the annoying work you need to do for SOC 2, like policy generation.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>The SDLC</strong>‍</h2><p>Your auditor will put together a list of concrete checks that you’ll need to either (a) provide evidence that you’ve already done, or (b) get started on doing. Again - this is not a comprehensive list, but it should help you get started and think about what auditors will be looking for.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Issue Tracking</strong>‍</p><p>Any “issues” that relate to the core business - new features, products, bugs, vulnerabilities, etc. - should be tracked. There are a hundred ways to do this - if you’re at a bigger company you’re probably using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>, the cool kids are using <a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a>, and there’s also <a href="https://clubhouse.io/">Clubhouse</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub Issues</a>, and many many more. The auditors are just looking to make sure known problems don’t slip through the cracks, and when a problem arises it’s dealt with effectively and in a timely manner.<br></p><figure id="w-node-361755762ee0-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f4fb0d32ee58930e6b6eb82_image%20(6).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>They might ask for a sample of your tracked issues over a given time period. You’ll save yourself a bunch of time down the road by finding a way to link commits and PRs to specific tickets, e.g. via a naming convention (BUG-453-fix-broken-dropdown).<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Change Testing and Review Cycles</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for documented policies that govern how you track, test, approve, and validate changes to your core application. Now ideally if you’re reading this, you’re not pushing directly to master - you’ve got a staging environment set up and a pull request process with required reviewers. Internal documentation might suffice here, but you’ll probably need to generate a policy (something Vanta can help with - more on that later).</p><p>If you’re working via a monorepo, building foolproof review cycles is pretty easy (it’s just a setting in GitHub). But if you’ve got a bunch of repositories all constantly changing, they should all ideally require reviews before merging in changes. Even if there’s only one engineer pushing code, laptops can get lost or stolen, and auditors will want to see that extra security to bestow the SOC 2 stamp.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Application and infrastructure</strong></h2><p>Here, auditors are trying to verify that your app is generally reliable, trackable, and that you fix things quickly when they come up. Again - all things that you probably already care about.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Encryption</strong>‍</p><p>You’ll generally want to encrypt customer data at rest, and make sure that sensitive requests (especially if they’re auth or customer data related) are encrypted in transit/motion (e.g. HTTPS). Ideally your site and app have SSL enforced, your certificate isn’t expired (duh), and there aren’t any known issues. Some auditors will also require an encryption policy that describes your company’s approach to encryption.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ APM / Monitoring</strong>‍</p><p>To be SOC 2 compliant, you’ll need to set up a basic application monitoring system, either in house or via a vendor like <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>. Auditors will also be interested in <em>what you do with this information</em> - how often is there downtime? How quickly does it get resolved? You might need to provide screenshots of outage statistics via your APM tool, and evidence that you resolved the issue via your issue tracking software. These usually come in the form of a post mortem / analysis and remedy of the root cause.</p><p>It’s not a given, but some auditors will specifically require that you set up a Load Balancer to handle traffic, and monitor that Load Balancer as well as your core app.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Logging and Backups</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for centralized logging from your app into a secure spot, via something custom like flat files, Elasticsearch, or an out of the box setup like Heroku (if you’re running on PaaS). You might be asked for daily backups - auditors are generally more concerned with your app’s data than your app itself, so if you’re using something like RDS, you can rely on their backup to S3 feature.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Vulnerabilities</strong>‍</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this is a major focus of the audit process, even if it’s not a common day-to-day occurrence. Auditors are basically looking for 3 major things here:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>There’s a safe way for anyone (literally, anyone) to notify your company of vulnerabilities</li><li>Your team is proactively checking for vulnerabilities via review meetings and software</li><li>When a vulnerability gets uncovered, your team fixes it </li></ol><p>You’ll want to set up an email inbox for disclosing vulnerabilities (e.g. <a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe8d9b9d8b8c978a87be89918c95918dd09d9193"><span data-cfemail="1360767066617a676a53647c61787c603d707c7e">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>), put together a policy for how you handle incident response, and (if relevant) provide evidence that you’ve resolved any major vulnerabilities (i.e. a post-mortem). Auditors will also look for proactive vulnerability scanning. If you’re running on managed infrastructure like Heroku, they do a lot of that for you. GitHub will also <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies">notify you of any dependencies with known vulnerabilities</a>.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Access controls / SaaS</strong></h2><p>This is where things get a bit tedious. In addition to your core infra (AWS or whatever cloud you’re using), chances are you’re using a bunch of SaaS like PagerDuty, Segment, GitHub, and the like, some cloud based and some (potentially) on prem. Auditors are looking for rigid access controls: only relevant team members should have access to customer data and applications, and access needs to be revoked when employees leave the company.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ Core Infrastructure Access</strong>‍</p><p>Auditors will be looking for even stricter controls when it comes to managing core infra. In practice, this means a robust IAM setup in AWS (or your cloud provider of choice) with clear lines between admins and non-admins, and a review process for adding new folks to the organization. You might need to prove that review via a screenshot of someone asking permission, or something along those lines.</p><p>As part of this review, you’ll probably end up needing to remove users from accounts that they previously had access to. Early on in the company lifecycle things are pretty free rein, but auditors will want to make sure that if you have no business querying the warehouse, you’re not on BigQuery.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ De-provisioning Users</strong>‍</p><p>If an employee leaves the company or gets terminated, their access to all company accounts - infrastructure, SaaS, any anything else - needs to be revoked, and auditors will often look for this to happen within one business day of the employee’s last day with the company. You’ll probably need to do this manually for the first couple of years in the company lifecycle, but eventually you’ll want to <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-directory-sync-scim">set up Directory Sync so computers can do it for you</a>.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>→ MFA</strong>‍</p><p>Any method for accessing customer data needs to be protected by (at least) …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-url="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-metrics-lead-to-effective-sprint-retrospectives" data-title="How Metrics Lead to Effective Sprint Retrospectives">
<p>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/retrospective">Atlassian’s playbook</a>, it states that Sprint Retrospective’s goal is to&nbsp;<em>identify how to improve teamwork by reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and why.</em>&nbsp;Usually, the meeting consists of brainstorming what the team did well and what the team needs to do better.</p>



<p>During my journey, I’ve been in many of these meetings, sometimes participating, sometimes facilitating. I’ve noticed that writing down post-its is painful for some people. When everybody is speaking, engineers get stuck and can’t think of anything else during the meeting.</p>



<p>Then, right after the meeting is over, many situations and problems emerge. They would like to discuss those topics. However, they wait a couple of weeks for the next meeting. Rarely they remember the issue. I don’t think the meeting gets as effective as it could.</p>



<p>To increase effectiveness, I think managers should promote a culture in which people raise their hands when the problems occur. They should discuss as soon and fresh in their mind as possible.</p>



<p>If the issue needs a more extended discussion, the team can add it to Evernote, Notion, GitHub Gist, or any other shareable document. A couple of sentences telling the problem with a little context would do the job.</p>



<p>The team can do the same as what did well. More post-its may pop up during the meeting. Then, the Scrum Master or facilitator can read the document.</p>



<p>When the meeting starts, the team already has a list of essential items to discuss. It saves time and makes it more productive.</p>



<p>So, how can teams make Sprint Retrospective meetings even more effective?</p>

<h2>Using Pull Request Lead Time &amp; Throughput in Sprint Retrospectives</h2>



<p>I’ve been talking about <a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/software-engineering-kpis-how-to-choose-the-best-fitting-metrics">Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput</a> for a while. If you’re familiar with the term Cycle Time, I recommend reading my article on why&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/why-you-should-use-lead-time-instead-of-cycle-time">I rather use Lead Time instead of Cycle Time</a>.</p>



<p>To be explicit, in this article, Pull Request Lead Time measures how many days a Pull Request takes to be merged, and Throughput is the number of merged Pull Requests.</p>



<p>These two metrics can truly help teams to understand how they are performing. Besides, teams benefit from them when they look for the variability along the weeks. The data bring valuable insights and allow teams to question their decisions.</p>



<p>Let me explain through an example.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="654" height="295" src="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24.png" alt="" srcset="https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24.png 654w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24-300x135.png 300w, https://mk0sourcelevel699i08.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-16.34.24-300x135@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"><figcaption>Lead Time and Throughput – Chart provided by SourceLevel</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I took this chart as an example. Let’s say we’re back in January 2020. We’ve started the Sprint Retrospective creating post-its for the team’s issues and appraisals during the last weeks of December 2019.</p>



<p>We’ve discussed a bit, and now someone shares the chart above to analyze the Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput.</p>



<p>If the sprint is two-weeks long, we could use the metrics to ask ourselves questions like this:</p>



<ul><li>Why did we merge less Pull Requests in the week of Dec 2nd compared to Nov 25th?</li><li>What did we do in the week of Nov 25th that allowed us to merge more Pull Requests than the last few Sprints?</li><li>Why did the Lead Time increase in the week of Dec 2nd?</li></ul>



<p>Asking this kind of question is fundamental. However, nobody should point fingers or blame other people. That’s not healthy nor effective.</p>



<p>I would expect answers like this:</p>



<ul><li>We merged less Pull Requests in the last week because we had a massive refactoring going on.</li><li>In the Week of Nov 25th, we fixed several small bug fixes that popped up after deploying a problematic feature in the week before.</li><li>The Lead Time increased because everyone held their reviews, and we made a task force to merge the refactoring.</li></ul>



<p>The numbers themselves don’t matter as much as the story behind them. Now it’s time to ask what are learnings from the last iteration. Here are some alternatives to address those issues:</p>



<ul><li>Should we avoid massive refactorings because they slow down everyone? Should we make it part of the team’s guidelines?</li><li>Deploying complex features may lead to a higher escaped bugs rate. How to minimize the impact? Should we invest more effort into testing? Should we deliver smaller changes? Should we adopt a more incremental approach? Should we consider a gradual rollout?</li><li>Was the task force an effective strategy? Maybe fewer people working on the refactoring at the same time ships it faster.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, the data allow teams to derive relevant aspects for the Retrospective. The discussion is a tremendous source of knowledge and should generate insights for improving the development flow.</p>



<h2>In short</h2>



<p>Sprint Retrospectives can be more effective using metrics. The team can extract valuable knowledge by questioning the Pull Request Lead Time and Throughput. Indeed, other metrics are useful, as well.</p>



<p>The crucial point is to use the metrics to distill tacit knowledge and formalize it. What went well and what went wrong should promote changes in the process, feed guidelines, and motivate new practices.</p>



<p>That’s what an effective Sprint Retrospective is about, in my opinion.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5269">

<p>The story begins with the project I was working on. Now a days deployment on cloud is beneficial as it saves lots of time and money to setup new infrastructure on your On-Premises, as cloud is also evolving from Bare HVM machines to containers as light weight VM’s. </p>



<p>This blog is not for the comparison of two Ingress Controller class but the challenges we faced while integrating client’s new requirement to the existing setup, which was hosted on GKE workloads with GCE (default) Ingress class as load balancer.</p>



<p>With time we realised the limitations of GCE Ingress class as it was still evolving and our project was already live on production. We brain stormed on how we can change the GCE Ingress class to Nginx Ingress class. Another hurdle was that the static ip which was registered for Load Balancer was Global not Regional. So we cannot change the Controller class to Nginx Ingress.</p>



<p>Moving forward to give briefing about the two Ingress class controllers: Nginx Ingress &amp; GCE Ingress. </p>



<p>Below are the features which we want to achieve in the project deployed on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) workloads. </p>



<ol><li>White listing of ip’s as we don’t want to expose it to the world.</li><li>Session Affinity (Stickiness).</li><li>Redirection of http request to https.</li></ol>



<p>As we know all the above three features are not straight forward to achieve in GCE Ingress Controller class.</p>



<p>To apply above features either we need to initiate <em>Nginx Ingress Controller</em> class or implement <em>Nginx Ingress from </em>scratch, which will act as Load Balancer instead of <em>GCE Ingress</em>.</p>



<div><p>“<em>Read this <a href="https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations/">Nginx doc</a> to explore other features supported by Nginx Ingress Controller with their anotations.</em>“</p></div>



<p>Sample YAML file to show the nginx ingress config</p>


<pre title="">apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
 kind: Ingress
 metadata:
   name: nginx-ingress
   namespace: default
   annotations:
     kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
     # White Listing of IP's
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/whitelist-source-range: "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
     # Redirect HTTP request to HTTPS
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "true"
     # Applying SSL certificate for HTTPS 
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-tls-secret: secretName
     # Session Affinity or Stickiness
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: "cookie"
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-max-age: max-age-in-sec
     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-expires: cookie-expire-in-sec
 spec:
   rules:
   - host: example.com
     http:   
       paths: 
       - path: /*
         backend:
           serviceName: frontend-service
           servicePort: 80
</pre>


<p>Now, let’s assume, you had applied GCE Ingress but still you want to achieve these features for Google Kubernetes Engine workloads.</p>



<h4>For white listing of IP’s</h4>



<p>In GCE we can use<a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor"> Cloud Armor</a>. It is a web application firewall service provided by Google cloud.</p>



<h4>For Session Affinity</h4>



<p>You can use a BackendConfig to configure&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#generated_cookie_affinity">generated cookie affinity</a>.</p>



<p>To do this exercise, you need a VPC-native cluster. Generated cookie affinity is useful only for Services that are backed by&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/container-native-load-balancing">network endpoint groups</a>, and network endpoint groups require a VPC-native cluster.</p>



<p>To set generated cookie affinity, use <strong>affinityType</strong> to “GENERATED_COOKIE” in your BackendConfig manifest. You can also use <strong>affinityCookieTtlSec</strong>&nbsp;to set the time period for the cookie.</p>



<pre><code>sessionAffinity:
  affinityType: "GENERATED_COOKIE"
  affinityCookieTtlSec: 50</code></pre>



<p>In your Service manifest, include the&nbsp;<code>cloud.google.com/neg: '{"ingress": true}'</code>&nbsp;annotation:</p>



<pre><code>kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-bsc-service
  labels:
    purpose: bsc-config-demo
  annotations:
    cloud.google.com/neg: '{"ingress": true}'
    beta.cloud.google.com/backend-config: '{"ports": {"80":"my-bsc-backendconfig"}}'</code></pre>



<h4>RedirectioN http to https</h4>



<p>Redirection from http to https feature is an upcoming feature in ingress.</p>



<p>As we know GCE Ingress is still in evolving phase and Nginx Ingress provides above features and more. I would like to recommend you should go ahead with Nginx Ingress till GCE Ingress evolves.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

September 8, 2020 | https://catalins.tech/javascript-es2020-the-features-you-should-know | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://catalins.tech/javascript-es2020-the-features-you-should-know">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><hr>

<p>ES2020 or ECMAScript 2020 brings exciting features to JavaScript. In this article, I want to talk about my favourite features from ES2020. That means the article does not cover all the additions. Thus, let us see my favourite new additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Import</li>
<li>Nullish Coalescing Operator</li>
<li>Optional Chaining Operator</li>
<li>Private Class Variables</li>
<li>Promise.allSettled</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information and all the additions, have a look at the official <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/2020/">ECMAScript Language Specification</a>. Additionally, you can have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md">finished proposals</a>.</p>

<p>One of the additions is that we can import dependencies dynamically with async/await. That means we do not have to import everything before, and we can import the dependencies only when we need them. As a result, the performance of the application improves by loading the modules at runtime.</p>
<p>How does it improve performance? With the conventional module system, we import the modules statically at the beginning of the program. Whether we need them now or later, we have to import them first. Also, all the code from an imported module is evaluated at the load time. Thus, it slows down the application unnecessarily. Why? Because it downloads the imported modules and evaluates the code of each module before executing your code.</p>
<p>Let us see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>if</span> (calculations) {
    <span>const</span> calculator = <span>await</span> <span>import</span>(<span>'./calculator.js'</span>);
    <span>const</span> result = calculator.add(num1, num2);

    <span>console</span>.log(result);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code snippet, you can see that we only import the calculator module when we want to perform calculations. As a result, we do not slow down the application unnecessarily by loading all the code before the runtime. Therefore, Dynamic imports is a handy addition.</p>

<p>"The nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand." <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator%22">Source: MDN</a></p>
<p>Basically, the Nullish Coalescing Operator allows us to check if a value is null or undefined, and provide a fallback value if that is the case. Let us see an example:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> score = <span>0</span>;
<span>let</span> pass = score ?? <span>60</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(pass);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code snippet, the value of <code>pass</code> is 0. The reason is that the <code>??</code> operator does not coerce zero to a falsy value. The variable <code>pass</code> only gets 60 assigned if the variable <code>score</code> is <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>However, what is the difference between double pipes "||" and this operator? When using the double pipes "||", it always returns a truthy value which might lead to some unexpected results. When using the nullish coalescing operator, we can be more strict and thus only allow the default when the value is null or undefined.</p>
<p>For instance, let us say we have the following code:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> score = <span>0</span>;
<span>let</span> pass = score || <span>60</span>;

<span>console</span>.log(pass);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the value 0 is treated as a falsy value when using <code>||</code>. In the above code snippet, the value of <code>pass</code> is 60, which is not what we want. Therefore, the double question mark allows us to check if a variable is nullish, which means if a variable is either undefined or null.</p>

<p>"Shorter and simpler expressions when accessing chained properties when the possibility exists that a reference may be missing." <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">Source: MDN</a></p>
<p>Using the Optional Chaining Operator, we can access deeply nested properties from an object. If the property exists, the operator returns its value. If the property does not exist, the operator returns undefined.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> person = {
 name: <span>"Catalin Pit"</span>,
 employer: {
  name: <span>"Catalins Tech"</span>,
 }
};

<span>console</span>.log(person?.employer?.name);
</code></pre>
<p>The above code snippet illustrates an example of accessing deeply nested object properties. However, we can use it on arrays, and function calls as well. Below, in the code snippet, you can see that we check if the array exists, and if it does, we access the third value. Also, you can see checking if a function from an API exists, and if it does, it calls it.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> allowedValues = [<span>1</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>10</span>, <span>13</span>, <span>90</span>, <span>111</span>];
<span>console</span>.log(allowedValues?.[<span>2</span>]);


<span>const</span> response = myAPI.getData?.();
</code></pre>
<p>In conclusion, the optional chaining operator is handy, and it also helps us make the code more readable and shorter. </p>

<p>The new method, Promise.allSettled() waits for all promises to be settled. That is, it takes an array of Promises, and it only returns when the promises are settled, either rejected or resolved.</p>
<p>When this function returns, we can loop over each Promise and see whether it was fulfilled or rejected, and why. Let us see an example of this function in action.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> promise1 = <span>Promise</span>.resolve(<span>5</span>);
<span>const</span> promise2 = <span>Promise</span>.reject(<span>"Reject promise"</span>);
<span>const</span> promises = [promise1, promise2];

<span>Promise</span>.allSettled(promises)
    .then(results =&gt; <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Here are are your promises results`</span>, results))
    .catch(err =&gt; <span>console</span>.log(<span>`Catch <span>${err}</span>`</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>The above code returns an array of objects, and each object represents a Promise. The object has a status and a value if the Promise is fulfilled, or status and a reason if the Promise is rejected. Therefore, <code>Promise.AllSettled</code> is useful when you want to complete all the promises, irrelevant whether they are rejected or fulfilled. </p>

<p>From now on, we can create private variables in classes in JavaScript as well. All you need to do to make a private variable is to add the hash symbol in front of the variable. For instance, <code>#firstName</code> is a private variable which cannot be accessed outside a class.</p>
<p>Trying to call the variable outside of the class, results in a SyntaxError.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> </span>{
  #firstName = <span>"Catalin"</span>;
  getFirstName() 
  { 
      <span>console</span>.log(<span>this</span>.#firstName) 
   }
}

<span>const</span> person1 = <span>new</span> Person();
person1.getFirstName() 

<span>console</span>.log(person1.firstName); 
<span>console</span>.log(person1.#firstName); 
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, you can see a private class variable in action. Trying to access the variable <code>firstName</code> outside the class, we get an error. Therefore, the addition is handy when we do not want to expose data outside a class.</p>

<p>The additions from the article are not the only ones. There are more, and I encourage you to have a look at the official <a target="_blank" href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/2020/">ECMAScript Language Specification</a> to see all of them. Also, I encourage you to play with the features to get a taste of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dynamic Imports</li>
<li>Nullish Coalescing Operator</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success.

In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand.

September 8, 2020 | https://harshil.net/blog/swift-sequence-collection-array | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://harshil.net/blog/swift-sequence-collection-array">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>A while ago, Paul Hudson posted <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1273378038760247298?s=21" title="Paul Hudson’s tweet">a poll on Twitter</a>, asking people what topic they found most difficult when they’d started learning Swift. An overwhelming number of responses were for generics, with a bunch of votes for optionals, closures, and some for the pattern matching techniques<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The thing that had me personally scratching my head for hours and hours on end was the whole suite of protocols included in the standard library backing common data structures such as Array, Set, Dictionary, and String.</p>
<p>I ran into the limitations or found a use case for all of the others, forcing me to spend some time studying them up, but the Sequence protocols offered had an escape hatch: The concrete types. The four aforementioned types covered about 99% of my use cases, and for a significant part of the remaining percent, building a wrapper around an Array was simple enough in a pinch. And for the rare case where I ended up with a <code>Slice</code> or a <code>Substring</code>, it was fairly easy to get back to familiar territory by just wrapping it in the appropriate type.</p>
<p>Since those days I’ve spent quite a bit of time understanding those protocols and so this post is an attempt to explain the functionality of some of the most important ones, and the reason for their existence.</p>
<h2>Why So Many Protocols</h2>
<p>Before going into the what and how, in this case I think it’s important to look at the why first. There are two largely interrelated reasons behind this elaborate structure we’re just about to dive into:
</p>
<h3>Designing API for minimum requirements</h3>
<p>The extremely granular nature of the protocol hierarchy means that you can design your API to accept data that matches your functional and performance requirements, rather than just the one concrete type you had in mind at the time.</p>
<p>Aside from letting you provide an implementation that works with multiple concrete types that also meet those requirements, it also allows your API’s users to use their own custom types, ones that you couldn’t have even thought of — and because of this design, also don’t need to think about.</p>
<p>Because Swift isn’t widely used in Apple’s own frameworks so far there aren’t many first-party examples of this, but a good one is <code>ForEach</code> in SwiftUI. Rather than just an Array, the data argument can be of any type that conforms to <code>RandomAccessCollecton</code>:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="0"><code><span><span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>ForEach</span><span> {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>init</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Data</span><span>, </span><span>Content</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>: Data, </span><span>content</span><span>: </span><span>@escaping</span><span> (Data.</span><span>Element</span><span>) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> Content</span><span>)</span><span> </span></span></span>
<span><span><span>		</span><span>where</span><span> Data</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>RandomAccessCollection</span><span>, </span></span></span>
<span><span><span>		      Data.</span><span>Element</span><span>:</span><span> Identifiable,</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>		      Content</span><span>:</span><span> View {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	  </span><span>// implementation</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>  }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>At this time of writing <code>RandomAccessCollection</code> has 43 conforming types across all of Apple’s SDKs, all of which can now be used with <code>ForEach</code> because of this design choice.</p>
<h3>Shared and specialised implementations</h3>
<p>Just as you can use the exact protocol required to design your APIs, so does the standard library, offering a range of algorithms appropriate for the given protocol.</p>
<p>The first benefit of this approach is that the concrete types themselves can be lightweight as an adopter only needs to implement behaviour specific to the data structure they’re designing. Simply conforming to the appropriate protocols gives you access to a range of functions such as  <code>allSatisfy</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, etc. with no extra cost. But what makes it especially worthwhile is being able to customise implementations as needed by overloading functions.</p>
<p>Swift doesn’t allow for overloading functions with the same name, arguments, and return value within the same type, however a type can overload a function from another type that it inherits from.</p>
<p>Written out in code, this is what it means:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="1"><code><span><span><span>protocol</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> {}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>extension</span><span> </span><span>A</span><span> {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>display</span><span>()</span><span> { </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>A</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span> }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span><span>protocol</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span>: A {}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>extension</span><span> </span><span>B</span><span> {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>display</span><span>()</span><span> { </span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>B</span><span>"</span><span>)</span><span> }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>C</span><span>: B {}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>C</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>display</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>// prints "B"</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>While <code>C.display()</code> can point to either implementation of the <code>display</code> function, because <code>B</code> inherits from <code>A</code>, the compiler will prefer the implementation from <code>B</code><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is possible for overloaded implementations to have different return types, and the compiler will pick the correct implementation based on the context of the call site.</p>
<p>This is where the real magic happens. The lower levels of the protocol hierarchy offer little information, and so while certain algorithms can be offered, their implementations are necessarily constrained by this knowledge limitation. However, as we go down the hierarchy and more information is made available, the implementations can be refined and made more performant, while remaining transparent to us Swift users, for the most part, thanks to overloaded implementations and type inference.</p>
<h2>Sequences &amp; Iterators</h2>
<p>Sequences and Iterators are the foundation on top of which all the other protocols and concrete types are built.</p>
<p><code>IteratorProtocol</code> is a protocol, as the name suggests<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>, and despite its rather fundamental nature, implementing one is fairly straightforward, with just one requirement:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="2"><code><span><span><span>protocol</span><span> </span><span>IteratorProtocol</span><span> {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>associatedtype</span><span> </span><span>Element</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>mutating</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>next</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Element</span><span>?</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Every time <code>next</code> is called, the iterator can return an instance of the type <code>Element</code>, or nil. Once it returns <code>nil</code>, the iterator is considered to be finished, having exhausted all its elements. The function is marked as mutating because all of the state required to derive the next value is held by the iterator itself, and so any time a value is vended, the iterator can use that as an opportunity to update its internal state in preparation for the next call.</p>
<p>There’s no stipulation that you have to return <code>nil</code>; this is intentional, and allows you to create infinite iterators.</p>
<p>While you probably don’t often create iterators directly, you do use them indirectly. A <code>for ... in</code> loop, for example, works by creating an iterator under the hood. Essentially every eager operation on a sequence (more on this in a bit) relies on the creation of an iterator.</p>
<p>An iterator thus is a one-way ordered walk through a list of elements.</p>
<p>The <code>Sequence</code> protocol has a bunch of requirements, most of which have sensible default implementations, and so a simplified representation of the minimal requirements is as shown below:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="3"><code><span><span><span>protocol</span><span> </span><span>Sequence</span><span> {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>associatedtype</span><span> </span><span>Element</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>associatedtype</span><span> </span><span>Iterator</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>IteratorProtocol</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>Iterator</span><span>.</span><span>Element</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>Element</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>makeIterator</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Iterator</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>In essence, a sequence’s sole job is to vend an iterator. There’s also an additional convenience built in, where an <code>IteratorProtocol</code> can also conform to <code>Sequence</code> with no extra code, by returning itself in the <code>makeIterator</code> function:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="4"><code><span><span><span>extension</span><span> </span><span>Sequence</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> Self.Iterator == Self {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>makeIterator</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Self</span><span> {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>		</span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>self</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	}</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>While you don’t have to add much or any code on top of your <code>IteratorProtocol</code> conformance to get a sequence, you get a fair amount of power with it. Functions such as <code>prefix</code>, <code>dropFirst/Last</code>, <code>reversed</code>, <code>contains</code>, <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and many more are made available at the sequence level. However because of the fairly low amount of knowledge available to us at this level, in that you can only ask for the next element one at a time, the implementations must do just that.</p>
<p><code>dropFirst(_:)</code>, for instance, gives you a new iterator, which iterates over the base iterator after eagerly executing and discarding as many values as specified.</p>
<p><code>dropLast(_:)</code>, meanwhile, traverses the whole sequence, adding every encountered value to an Array, and removing the first element if the Array’s length exceeds the specified value, thus having a time and space complexity of O(<em>n</em>).</p>
<h2>Collection</h2>
<p>While in practise it is often used that way, <code>Sequence</code> doesn’t make any promises regarding repeated access. To get the guarantee of repeated access, you need to conform to the <code>Collection</code> protocol.</p>
<p><code>Collection</code> has a bunch more requirements, but a simplified representation of them is as below:</p>
<pre data-language="swift" data-index="5"><code><span><span><span>protocol</span><span> </span><span>Collection</span><span>: Sequence {</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>associatedtype</span><span> </span><span>Element</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>associatedtype</span><span> </span><span>Index</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Comparable</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>associatedtype</span><span> </span><span>Indices</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Collection</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>associatedtype</span><span> </span><span>SubSequence</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Collection</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>var</span><span> startIndex</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Index</span><span> { </span><span>get</span><span> }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>var</span><span> endIndex</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Index</span><span> { </span><span>get</span><span> }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>var</span><span> indices</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Indices</span><span> { </span><span>get</span><span> }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>index</span><span>(</span><span>after</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>: </span><span>Index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Index</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>subscript</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>: </span><span>Index</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Element</span><span> { </span><span>get</span><span> }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>	</span><span>subscript</span><span>(</span><span>bounds</span><span>: </span><span>Range</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Index</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>SubSequence</span><span> { </span><span>get</span><span> }</span></span></span>
<span><span><span>}</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>The fundamental improvement over <code>Sequence</code> is that a collection lets you access values at any given position, rather than just the one after the one you requested last. </p>
<p>Note here that the <code>Index</code> type isn’t <code>Int</code>, it can be any type that conforms to <code>Comparable</code>. Another important thing here is that you’re never supposed to alter or form indices yourself, you should always ask the collection instance you intend to subscript to do that for you. This ensures that the index you receive is valid, and in some cases it’s required to the point where you can’t even construct an index without querying the collection.</p>
<p>So to enable you to calculate indices, a collection of all of the collection’s valid indices is exposed, as are the starting and the ending indices (which is the index after the last valid one; i.e. it is the first invalid index). The index right after a particular one can also be calculated using the <code>index(after:)</code> function. There is also an <code>index(_:offsetBy:)</code> convenience function which lets you compute the index at some positive integral offset, along with two <code>firstIndex(where:)</code> and <code>firstIndex(of:)</code> functions which let you find the first index matching some condition, or containing some value, respectively.</p>
<p>You can use these indices to subscripted values either individually or as a range. Going back to the point about always asking the collection to form an index for you: it is technically considered undefined behaviour to subscript a collection with an index that wasn’t derived from it.</p>
<p>Subscripting a single index returns a single value. Subscripting a range of indices doesn’t return an Array, however, but rather a <code>SubSequence</code>. A collection can use a custom subsequence type, but the standard library provides a good default with the <code>Slice</code> type. The requirements for using a custom <code>SubSequence</code> type …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Since its birth in Europe at the end of the 1980s, spintronics has shown an exceptional development</strong> at the fundamental level, and offers more than ever important prospects in information and communication technologies. The history of spintronics is marked by many important discoveries and applications, including magnetic recording for computer hard disks.</p> <p>Today, <strong>spintronics is gaining momentum in the microelectronics industry</strong> with the launch of industrial production from all the major players in the field (Samsung, TSMC, INTEL, Global Foundries) of a new type of magnetic memory - MRAMs (Magnetic Random Access Memory). This offers electronic circuits new functionalities and improved performance, particularly in terms of power consumption.</p> <p><strong>The European portfolio of patents in spin electronics is very strong</strong>, with several key patents on magnetic field sensor and MRAM technologies, reflecting European excellence in fundamental research. This has enabled the launch of several spin-offs</p> <ul> <li>Memories : Crocus Technology, Antaios,</li> <li>Radiofrequency components: NanOsc ABs,</li> <li>Magnetic sensors : Crocus Technology, Crivasense, Magnomics,</li> <li>Material growth : Singulus,</li> <li>Device testing : HProbe.</li> </ul> <p>However, these industrial benefits remain modest in Europe compared to those in Asia and the United States. It is the ambition of the European SpintronicFactory consortium, created in 2016, to promoting excellence in European research in spintronics, along with its potential for innovation. <strong>The consortium publishes its vision of the roadmap of spintronics for applications, in Nature Electronics.</strong></p> <p><strong>For memories</strong>, the challenges identified concern the realization of very high density chips by developing 3D-inspired disruptive solutions, as well as the reduction of power consumption of chips by implementing fundamental interface effects, such as spin-orbit quantum coupling or the control of magnetic properties through voltage without the flow of electric current.</p> <p><strong>Sensor challenges</strong> reflect the very diverse needs of this market, based on improved sensitivity, magnetic field measurement range and innovative sensor architectures. Today, the main markets are smart phones (3D magnetometers / digital compasses), the automotive sector (linear or angular position and speed sensors), current and power sensors, and scanners. New applications are emerging in the Internet of Things (IOT) and biomedical fields with the development of reliable low-power devices on silicon or flexible substrates.</p> <p>Spintronics can also bring a major contribution in the field of r<strong>adio-frequency and THz technologies</strong>. Indeed, a direct current can be used to generate radiofrequency oscillations of magnetization, and conversely radiofrequency excitations can be converted into direct voltage. These oscillator and diode functions are interesting for communication components. The proof of concept has been demonstrated, it is now necessary to allow their concrete integration in different application fields, in particular compact and low power telecommunications, THz applications (imaging, security), micro energy recovery, artificial intelligence.</p> <p>Finally, in a more prospective way, milestones are proposed to demonstrate the applied potential of spintronics to directly carry out <strong>information processing</strong> using the spin of the electron and not only its electrical charge, making it possible to further reduce the consumption of electronic circuits or to introduce new functionalities. The challenges identified relate in particular to the efficiency of conversion between spin current and charge current in the new concepts.</p> <p>Meeting these various challenges will require progress in the control of non-conventional materials, their interfaces on which spintronic functionalities often depend, their nanofabrication and their implementation in production lines, including their specific metrology. Developments will also have to be carried out in numerical simulation, ranging from the integration of new effects in multiphysical codes, to multi-scale approaches from the atom to systems.</p> <p>Links:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://magnetism.eu/88-the-spintronicfactory-stf-.htm">SpinTronicFactory</a>.</li> <li>Review article from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10584">arXiv</a> and the <a href="https://rdcu.be/b6k59">Publisher</a>.</li> </ul></div></div>]]>

<p>But how does an application running on EC2 use this instance profile? Where do the credentials come from? How does this work without any application configuration change?</p>



<p>EC2 shares the credentials with the application through the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">metadata service</a>. Each instance can access this service through <code><a href="http://169.254.169.254/" rel="nofollow">http://169.254.169.254</a></code> (unless disabled) and EC2 will expose instance-specific information there. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html">exposed information</a> includes AMI id, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-add-user-data.html">user-data</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html">instance id and IPs</a>, and more.</p>



<p>The instance profile credentials are exposed on <code><a href="http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/" rel="nofollow">http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/</a></code>. When you <code>curl</code> this URL on an EC2 instance, you will get the name of the instance profile attached to the instance. When you <code>curl</code> the same URL with the instance profile name at the end, you get the temporary credentials as JSON. The metadata service will return access key id, secret access key, a token, and the expiration date of the temporary credentials. Behind the scenes it is using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html">STS AssumeRole</a>.</p>

<p>All this data can be used to configure any application to use the role attached to the instance profile. You just have to be careful not to use it past the expiration date. You must also remember to check for new temporary credentials once the expiration date passes. If you are going to use these credentials manually, remember that the token is required. Normal user access keys don’t have a token, but temporary credentials require it.</p>



<p>To save you on <code>curl</code> calls and to automate this process further, all AWS SDKs check the instance profile for credentials first. As you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/e70cc1d46d9301cc12266c4666759de4afec9dbb/botocore/utils.py#L393-L446">source code</a>, this is exactly what the Python SDK, <a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore">botocore</a>, does to get credentials from the instance profile. In the end, everything just works as expected, and no application configuration is required.</p>

                            <p>
                                I write for SaaS founders and marketers. My audience love case studies.
                                I researched and wrote an analysis of
                                <a href="https://www.thoughtlytics.com/newsletter/notion-organic-growth-strategies">Notion's growth strategies</a>
                                that ranks #1 on Google for the search term 'notion growth' ahead of mighty TechCrunch, NYTimes, and Forbes.

                                Compared to my website, all other websites on this SERP have very high domain authority.
                                My post ranking above these sites busts the myth of domain authority being a constraint for
                                ranking on Google SERP.

                                Growth loops have helped many internet businesses with compounding growth. There is a lot of
                                interest in growth loops among SaaS founders and marketers. I wrote the

<p>For more than 5 years, we are in the age of&nbsp;<strong>microservices</strong>. Monoliths sound like 90’s tech and a thing we should be embarrassed about having. We’ve seen countless discussions about microservices vs monoliths. We all remember the epic talks of engineers and CTOs from&nbsp;<strong>Netflix</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Spotify</strong>, and other big players. Loads of buzzwords thrown every five minutes: scalability, ownership, devops, redundancy, and more.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://fjrevoredo.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/server-1235959-1024x683.jpg" alt="microservices server image" srcset="https://fjrevoredo.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/server-1235959-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://fjrevoredo.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/server-1235959-300x200.jpg 300w, https://fjrevoredo.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/server-1235959-768x512.jpg 768w, https://fjrevoredo.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/server-1235959-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://fjrevoredo.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/server-1235959.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>So what happened in the last five years? Microservices became the one-size-fits-all solution for every technical problem. But it wasn’t only a trend for startups and a catchy phrase for TED talking gurus. Even traditional corporations like&nbsp;<strong>Coca Cola</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>BestBuy</strong>&nbsp;are moving all their infrastructure to microservices.</p>



<p>So… there must be a catch right? It is time we have a serious bias-free discussion about this. More than enough time passed and this topic is somewhat mature. We can find lots of failures and successes, and even detailed&nbsp;<em>post-mortem</em>&nbsp;about them from the people who did it.</p>



<h2>Pros and cons</h2>



<p>As we stated earlier this topic was analyzed over and over, so we’ll just do a quick recap with no further explanation for the sake of simplicity. You could easily skip this part if you are already familiar with them.</p>



<p><strong>Microservices</strong></p>







<div>
<div>
<ul id="block-84022689-4fae-4c96-b072-b4d3fe56c839"><li>Horizontal Scalability</li><li>Code reusability</li><li>No single-point-of-failure / Fault-tolerant (If done correctly)</li><li>Elastic (if done correctly and placed on an elastic infrastructure)</li><li>Can greatly reduce hosting cost</li><li>Versatile – Any microservice can be written on any language if the correct guidelines are implemented.</li><li>Infrastructure can be distributed “easily” between servers, cloud zones, etc.</li><li>Low coupling between components</li></ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul><li>Steeper learning curve</li><li>Need more experienced developers</li><li>The cost/time to migrate to a microservice architecture could be huge.</li><li>Testing could become hell if not handled properly.</li><li>Needs lots of requirements to be implemented correctly( ci/cd, monitoring, etc)</li><li>Cognitive load. Microservices can become a complicated mesh and introduce a lot of new problems inherent to them (concurrency, service discovery, data consistency, load balancing etc)</li></ul>
</div>
</div>



<p><strong>Monoliths</strong></p>







<div>
<div>
<ul id="block-84022689-4fae-4c96-b072-b4d3fe56c839"><li>Simplicity</li><li>Need less boilerplate code to start a new project</li><li>No special knowledge is required. Every developer is used to work with monoliths. Makes hiring easier.</li><li>Business requirements are usually easier to implement.</li><li>Straightforward to test since the beginning.</li><li>Faster time to market if the requirements are concrete and well known.</li></ul>
</div>



<div>
<ul><li>Expensive to scale.</li><li>High coupling between components</li><li>Scalability has software and hardware limitations on monoliths.</li><li>Develop environments could become huge overtime.</li><li>Could be hard/expensive to migrate into a cloud environment</li><li>Could be impossible to scale if there’s too much technical debt on the codebase.</li></ul>




</div>
</div>



<h2>Discussion</h2>



<p>To be honest,&nbsp;<strong>you probably don’t need microservices</strong>&nbsp;if you’re not google-scale or you’re not expecting to grow insanely fast like Netflix, and surely you don’t need to migrate your whole infrastructure to microservices right now.</p>



<p>It could sound a little&nbsp;<em>cliché</em>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<strong><em>you need the right tool for the job</em></strong>. Most of the companies and even crazy startups won’t see the full benefit of implementing them but will need to deal with all the difficulties they could create.</p>



<p>There’s also some kind of&nbsp;<strong>“conflict of interest”</strong>&nbsp;between developers and management in this topic (like in many others). Developers always want to try the new flashy things (and we got to admit that we all like to brag about using the latest trendy framework/tech) and also want to add to their resume all that beautiful buzz-words.</p>



<p>On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>management</strong>&nbsp;mostly sees risks in changing the whole architecture ( with some common-sense) and almost no tangible benefits; and management mostly wants new fancy features they can sell to the clients (or the upper management). All this is a recipe for a perfect disaster.</p>



<p>Moving into microservices must be done&nbsp;<strong>almost perfectly</strong>&nbsp;to make it worth it. Even experienced developers could lead a decent monolith into a microservice hell. Almost all failed attempts get the worst of both worlds, an anti-pattern called Distributed Monolith (you can read more&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@joaovasques/your-distributed-monoliths-are-secretly-plotting-against-you-4c1b20324a31" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>)</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>If we analyze most of the successful migrations into microservices, they were driven almost exclusively from necessity rather than preference. Most of the big early adopters (like Netflix) couldn’t find a way to achieve their business goals with a monolithic architecture.</p>



<p><strong>This also isn’t a recipe for guaranteed success</strong>. If you can’t design and implement a modular and robust monolith what makes you think you could do it better with microservices?</p>



<p>Like almost everything in life, the sweet spot is somewhat in the middle. The ideal scenario would be designing a modular enough monolith that could be eventually divided into smaller pieces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following that approach, you can start to migrate big modules into stand-alone services (not microservices), and begin turning your monolith into a&nbsp;<strong>Service Oriented Architecture</strong>&nbsp;(<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener">SOA</a>) as needed. After some time, services will be split into smaller services and it will be a time when you’ll have to unavoidably start to deal with all the microservices problems (service discovery, load balancing, consistency, concurrency, latency, etc).</p>



<p>But after all,&nbsp;<strong>this approach is much more humane</strong>. All the teams can transition seamlessly into the microservice ecosystem without the hassle of hiring 200 new specialists and the priorities can be managed more accordingly to the business requirements.</p>



<p>As some final words, this is just one approach and&nbsp;<strong>nothing here is written on stone</strong>. Many authors claim that is impossible to seamlessly transition a monolith into successful microservices, and that you’ll need to eventually re-write everything from scratch.</p>



<p>This is debatable but the main topic is that reality usually doesn’t go well with absolutes. Every problem will need a different degree of granularity.&nbsp;<strong>So maybe there’s no point in keep discussing microservices vs monoliths</strong></p>

  <div>
    <p>For the past few months, I’ve been running a handful of SSH Honeypots on some
cloud providers, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a>,
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b2cffefc9c81">DigitalOcean</a>, and
<a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&amp;u=2497236&amp;m=46483&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">NameCheap</a>.
As opposed to more complicated honeypots looking at attacker behavior, I decided
to do something simple and was only interested in where they were coming from,
what tools might be in use, and what credentials they are attempting to use to
authenticate.  My dataset includes 929,554 attempted logins over a period of a
little more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a big surprise, I’ll go ahead and let you down easy: my
analysis hasn’t located any new botnets or clusters of attackers.  But it’s been
a fascinating project nonetheless.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="honeypot-design">Honeypot Design</h2>

<p>With a mere 200ish lines of Go, I implemented a honeypot server using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh?tab=doc"><code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code></a>
library as the underlying implementation.  I advertised a portable OpenSSH
version as the server version string (sent to clients on connection).  I then
logged each connection to a SQLite database, including the timestamp, IP
address, client version, and credentials used to (attempt to) authenticate.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-credentials">Analysis of Credentials</h2>

<p>In a surprise to absolutely nobody, <code>root</code> is by far the most commonly tried
username for login sessions.  I suspect there must be many attackers trying
lists of passwords with just <code>root</code> as the username, as 78% of attempted logins
were with username <code>root</code>.  None of the remainder of the top 10 are particularly
surprising, although <code>usuario</code> was not one I expected to see.  (It is Spanish
for <code>user</code>.)</p>

<p>Blank passwords are the most common attempted passwords, followed by other
obvious choices, like <code>123456</code> and <code>password</code>.  Just off the top 10 list was a
surprising choice of password: <code>J5cmmu=Kyf0-br8CsW</code>.  Interestingly, a Google
search for this password only finds other people with experience running
credential honeypots.  It doesn’t appear in any of the password wordlists I
have, including <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a> and
others.  If anyone knows what this is a password for, I’d love to know.</p>

<p>There were a number of other interesting passwords such as <code>7ujMko0admin</code>, used
for a bunch of networked DVRs, and also known to be used by malware attacking
IoT devices.  There are other passwords that don’t look obvious to a US-centric
view of the world, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>baikal</code> – a lake in Siberia</li>
  <li><code>prueba</code> – Spanish for test</li>
  <li><code>caonima</code> – a Mandarin profanity written in Pinyin</li>
  <li><code>meiyoumima</code> – Mandarin for “no password”</li>
  <li><code>woaini</code> – Mandarin for “I love you”</li>
  <li><code>poiuyt</code> – <strike>The name for an optical illusion also known as the "devil's tuning
fork"</strike> <strong>Edit:</strong> multiple redditors pointed out this is the begginning
of the top row of the keyboard from right to left.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also dozens and dozens of keyboard walks, like <code>1q2w3e</code>, <code>1qaz@WSX</code>,
and <code>!QAZ2wsx</code>.  There are many more that took me much longer to realize they
were keyboard walks, such as <code>4rfv$RFV</code> and <code>qpwoei</code>.</p>

<p>It has actually fascinated me to look at some of the less obvious passwords and
discern their background.  Many are inexplicable, but I assume they are from
hardcoded passwords in devices or something along those lines.  Or perhaps
someone let their cat walk across the keyboard to generate it.  I’ve certainly
had that experience.</p>

<p>Overall, the top 10 usernames and top 10 passwords (not necessarily together)
are:</p>

<p>Again, no real surprises here.  <code>ubnt</code> is a little bit higher than I would have
thought (for Ubiquiti networking gear) but I suppose there’s a fair bit of their
gear on the internet.  It’s interesting to see the mix of “lazy admin” and
“default credentials” here.  It’s <em>mildly</em> interesting to me that all substrings
of the first 10 digits (3 or longer) are included, <em>except</em> for 7 digits.  I
guess 7 digit passwords are less common?</p>

<h2 id="timing-information">Timing Information</h2>

<p>Though I imagine these kind of untargeted scans are long-term processes
continually running, I decided to check and see what the timing looked like
anyway.  Neither the day of week analysis nor the hour of day analysis look
like there’s any significant variance.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/days_of_week.png" alt="Day of Week">
<img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/hours.png" alt="Hour of Day"></p>

<p>Looking at the number of login requests over the time period where I’ve been
running the honeypots shows the traffic to be intermittent.  While I didn’t
expect the number to be constant, the variance is much higher than I expected.
I imagine a larger sample size and more nodes would probably make the results
more even.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/dates.png" alt="Day of Study"></p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-sources">Analysis of Sources</h2>

<p>So where are all of these requests coming from?  I want to start by noting that
<em>none</em> of my analysis is an attempt to attribute the actors making the requests
– that’s just not possible with this kind of data.  There’s two ways to look at
the source of requests – in terms of the network, and in terms of the (assumed)
geography.  My analysis relied on the IP to ASN and IP to Country data provided
by <a href="https://iptoasn.com/">iptoasn.com</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the country-level data, networks from China lead the pack by a long
shot (62% of all login attempts), followed by the US.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not claiming that these countries mean anything other than location
of the autonomous system (AS) that originates the requests.  I also did not do
individual IP geolocation, so the results should be taken with a small grain of
salt.</p>

<p>So what networks are sourcing this traffic?  I have the <a href="https://systemoverlord.com/static/attachments/gopot/asns.csv">full AS counts and

<p>Chinanet is no surprise given the high ratio of China in general.  OVH is a
low-cost host known to have liberal AUP, so is popular for both malicious and
research purposes.  DigitalOcean and Microsoft, of course, are popular cloud
providers.  Surprisingly, AWS only sourced about 600 connections, unless they
have a large number of IPs on a non-Amazon ASN.</p>

<p>Overall, traffic came from 27,448 unique IPv4 addresses.  Of those, more than 11
thousand sent only a single request.  At the other end of the spectrum, the top
IP source sent 64,969 login requests.</p>

<p>Most hosts sent relatively few requests, the large numbers are outliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/ipcnts.png" alt="IP Count Graph"></p>

<p>Surely, by now a thought has crossed your mind: how many of these requests are
coming from Tor?  Surely the Tor network is a wretched hive of scum and villany,
and the source of much malicious traffic, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/tor.png" alt="Tor Graph"></p>

<p>Not at all.  Only 219 of the unique source IPs were identified as Tor exit
nodes, representing only 0.8% of the sources.  On a per-request basis, even a
smaller percentage of requests is seen from Tor exit nodes.</p>

<h2 id="client-software">Client Software</h2>

<p>Remember – this is self-reported by the client application, and just like I can
spoof the server version string, so can clients.  But I still thought it would
be interesting to take a brief look at those.</p>

<p>You know, I didn’t expect that.  <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> as the top
client strings.  (Also not sure what to make of the case difference.)  I wonder
if people are building the PuTTY SSH library into a tool for scanning or
wrapping the binary in some kind of script.</p>

<p>Go, paramiko, and libssh are less surprising, as they’re libraries designed for
integration.  It’s hard to know if the OpenSSH requests are linked into a
scanning tool or just wrapped versions of the SSH client.  At some point in the
future, I might dive more into this and trying to figure out which software uses
which libraries (at least for the publicly-known tools).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I was hoping to find something earth-shattering in this research.  Instead, I
found things that were much as expected – common usernames and passwords,
widespread scanning, large numbers of requests.  One thing’s for sure though:
connect it to the internet and someone’s going to pwn it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In this series of posts, we will develop an analogy between the realistic assumptions debate in economic methodology and the current discussion over interpretability when using machine learning models in the wild. While this connection may seem fuzzy at first, the past seventy years or so of economic methodology offers many lessons for machine learning theorists and practitioners to avoid analysis paralysis and make progress on the interpretability issue - one way or the other.</p><div>
    <p>This post looks at the current state of economic methodology with respect to the realistic assumptions debate. After briefly surveying the history of economic methodology, we’ll walk through two recent arguments in the realistic assumptions debate: one in favor of instrumentalism as a theoretical ideal and the other favoring a limited form of realism in practice. In light of these arguments, I’ll argue that practitioners can still adopt some form of limited realism in practice if such an approach is a expedient guide to creating models with desirable properties.</p>

<h2 id="the-recent-history-of-economic-methodology">The Recent History of Economic Methodology</h2>
<p>The Philosophy of Economics and Economic Methodology have received excellent, approachable historical surveys from <a href="http://revue-philosophie-economique.com/num/2017-2-vol-18-varia/philosophy-of-economics-a-retrospective-reflection/">Dan Hausman</a> and <a href="https://www.cairn-int.info/journal-revue-de-philosophie-economique-2019-2-page-221.htm">Wade Hands</a> in recent years. Since its modern inception in the mid-1970s, Economic Methodology has been influenced by trends in, unsurprisingly, both economics and philosophy. In the latter half of the twentieth century, methodology was greatly influenced by the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-empiricism/">logical empiricism</a> program in the Philosophy of Science which was interested in formal theories of language, induction, and scientific laws. Hands uses the phrase “the shelf of scientific philosophy” to describe the early approach to economic methodology. In these cases, perspectives from philosophy of science, such as <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/#PopFal">Popper’s falsificationism</a>, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lakatos/#ImprPoppScie">Lakatos’ research programmes</a>, and so forth, were directly applied to economics in more-or-less a cookie cutter fashion. In a later, more mature phase, philosophers of economics would recognize properties of economics that differentiate it from the physical sciences.</p>

<p>Moving into the early twenty-first century, methodology becomes influenced by the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/research/charts/an-empirical-turn-in-economics-research">empirical turn in economics</a>. To illustrate this turn, the graph below summarizes results from <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.p20171117#page=4">a paper by Joshua Angrist et al.</a> which attempts to classify publications in economics as either theory or empirical by subfield. The authors find the share of empirical papers to be substantially increasing over time nearly across the board during this time frame.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aeaweb.org/content/file?id=4757"></p>

<p>Hands suggests that the empirical turn is part of a broadening of the set of methods available to the economist:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Walrasian and econometric normal science that characterized the second half of the twentieth century gave way to a much more diverse set of scientific practices in recent years: game theory, behavioral economics, behavioral welfare economics, new empirical techniques and evidence-based economics of various forms, agent-based and complexity economics, and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hausman notes that, while the economic methodology in the past focused on scientific laws, today’s methodological work focuses on causality and estimation. Note, though, that the concept of constructing models has always been central (see Mary Morgan’s <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/world-in-the-model/6FD82E4D498F94CBE5F56078FD007729">The World in the Model</a>); it’s only what is meant by model that has shifted and broadened over time. One issue that continues to rear its head in Economic Methodology is the realistic assumptions debate. Hands refers to this debate as “the issue of false assumptions and highly idealized models” and describes it as “one of the longest-running debates in economic methodology”. In the past decade, several new arguments have appeared lending fresh perspectives to this debate. Below, we consider two such arguments that I find particularly convincing.</p>

<h2 id="reiss-cheers-for-instrumentalism">Reiss Cheers for Instrumentalism</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/idealization-and-the-aims-of-economics-three-cheers-for-instrumentalism/07E3296CC23CD12444C39901783C79AF">Idealization and the Aims of Economics</a>, Julian Reiss argues in favor of instrumentalism in economics since practitioners care about the results of true/causal assumptions rather than caring intrinsically about truth and causation. Reiss holds that this is the case even if we take full or strong realism as naive and adopt a limited or causal realism where only the relevant causal mechanism is accurately captured in the assumptions.</p>

<p>One feature we expect of a good model is to give accurate predictions of relevant phenomena in the world. Reiss offers us the following argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose, then, a new model can be built that has just the same degree of significance along one dimension as the old model – the same degree of predictive accuracy, say – but it has the additional virtue of being true. There are now two possibilities. Either the true model brings with it some additional significance (along some other dimension). In this case nothing is lost by demanding significance alone, as the instrumentalist does. Or the model brings no additional significance. But if this is the case, it is very hard to see what that additional value should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We see a similar argument regarding causal mechanisms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>why seek to discover underlying causal structure? The classical answer is that knowing causal structure has a number of cognitive and practical virtues. We know now that causal knowledge has these virtues at best contingently but not necessarily. It is other features that realize the cognitive and practical virtues we seek,and causality may or may not co-occur with these other features. But then to the extent that we do want the virtues, we should seek the relevant features and not causality.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…building causal models has enormous informational requirements. The probabilistic theory of causation proves this point. In one formulation this theory says that to learn a new causal law ‘C causes E’ from probabilistic dependencies, one has to stratify with respect to all other causes of E(Cartwright 1979). That is, only when the probabilistic dependence of E on C persists conditional on all other causes of E, the probabilistic dependence is indicative of a causal relation. But when are we ever in the fortuitous position to know all but one causes of an outcome of interest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reiss’ conclusion is that practitioners ought to focus on the predictive accuracy and robustness of their models rather realistic assumptions or underlying causal mechanisms, since we ultimately care about the former and not latter.</p>

<h2 id="causal-mechanisms-in-practice">Causal Mechanisms in Practice</h2>

<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjps/article-abstract/61/3/541/1395474">Economic Modelling as Robustness Analysis</a> argues that the practice of establishing derivational robustness in economics provides epistemic support for economic theories in lieu of empirical evidence.</p>

<p>The authors (Jaakko Kuorikoski, Aki Lehtinen, and Caterina Marchionni) divide model assumptions into three categories: substantial assumptions, Galilean assumptions, and tractability assumptions. Substantial assumptions “identify a set of causal factors that in interaction make up the causal mechanism about which the modeller endeavours to make important claims”. These are the claims we expect to be veridical. Galilean assumptions act to isolate the causal mechanism modeled by the Substantial assumptions. Tractability assumptions simply the problem, e.g. assuming some function is linear or simple and so forth.</p>

<p>The act of establishing derivational robustness involves proving that the result attained from the Substantial assumptions holds under a variety of Galilean and Tractability assumptions. The authors provide an example from Geographical Economics whereby a <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261763">model is constructed by Paul Krugman</a> showing geographic concentration under particular conditions. Further research has extended Krugman’s results to show that they hold under more general Galilean and Tractability assumptions. This lends credence that the models’ Substantial core captures the essential mechanisms involved in this economic process.</p>

<p>On the one hand, this argument is a rational reconstruction for a widespread practice among economists: attempting to establish robustness of the core mechanisms of a model against varying auxiliary assumptions. On the other, this is a sort of middle position of limited realism or at least a way to put a form of limited realism into practice. Note that realism is limited since only the Substantial assumptions are taken to be true.</p>

<h2 id="having-it-both-ways">Having it both ways?</h2>

<p>Though there is an apparent conflict between the above arguments for instrumentalism and limited realism, we may resolve it by considering the perspective of the practitioner while still accepting both arguments.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with the observation that at the level of the practitioner, it doesn’t matter what the ultimate justification for a method or methodology is. All that matters to the practitioner (on an optimistic interpretation) is whether or not a method or methodology sufficiently achieves the practitioner’s goals, e.g. predictive accuracy, robustness, etc. Moreover, practitioners are under no obligation to use optimal methods.</p>

<p>The practitioner may concede to Reiss that the ultimate justification of their methods is not truth, causation, etc. but to attain models with other desirable properties. This does not rule out, however, that practitioners may employ methods or methodologies which rely on true assumptions or causal mechanisms if they sufficiently achieve a practitioner’s goals. In this sense, we can read Reiss as not arguing against methods or methodologies that rely on veridical or causal assumptions but against the necessity of such assumptions.</p>

<p>This leaves us with the amusing (meta)-methodological principle to use methods or methodologies that produce <em>good</em> models.</p>

<p>Benjamin Disraeli, speaking in the House of Commons in 1872, said of then Prime Minister William Gladstone’s Cabinet: ‘Behold, a range of extinct volcanoes; not a flame flickers upon a single pallid crest.’ ‘Extinct volcanoes’ would be far too generous a phrase to describe the current crop of Western leaders – if political regimes could be said to decay from the head downwards, then we are in some trouble. The political scientist Wilfred Pareto said that leaders can be divided into two types – lions who are distinguished by their machismo and foxes who are distinguished by their intelligence. In world politics, the lions are on the rampage because the foxes have abandoned the public weal.</p>



<p>In America, the proportion of people who say that they trust government has fallen from about three-quarters in the early 1960s to less than a third today. Across the rest of the West, opinion is moving in the same direction if not quite as sharply.&nbsp;Governance has emerged as a central feature of the Covid-19 crisis: we have learnt that good government can make all the difference between living and dying. One problem with poor government is that it is self-sustaining. The lower government falls in public esteem the more likely it is that able people will shun it. And the more able people shun it the more government becomes a butt of jokes, even the object of outright contempt.</p>



<p>The problem of good government and leadership is nothing new. In the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and early 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;centuries, England’s political system was known as ‘Old Corruption’ because it was so self-serving. An entrenched elite treated the state as a source of jobs and benefits. The state was so disconnected from the forces of industry and commerce that were transforming society that many liberals wanted to reduce government to a night-watchman.&nbsp;These tensions are never far away from the contemporary scene. Modern politicians routinely take up lucrative jobs in the private sector when they leave office – often working for the industries that they once regulated. Indeed,&nbsp;‘reciprocal nepotism’ is now so commonplace on Capitol Hill, with members of Congress giving jobs to the children of friends in return for their friends giving jobs to their children, that Melanie Sloan, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, comments: ‘Members of Congress basically are profit centres for their entire families’.</p>



<p>How did the Victorians shake themselves out of this cycle of decline? A cohort of reforming politicians and educators realised that a successful commercial society required a successful modern state. They suggested a solution: a collective immersion in the wisdom of Plato. They set about revitalising the patronage-ridden civil service and educational world by opening opportunities and jobs to competition.<strong> </strong>They treated Plato’s&nbsp;<em>Republic</em>  as a near deified talisman against&nbsp;the twin evils of self-indulgence and short-termism. In the present day, this spirit requires us to set down self-help guides and leadership manuals in favour of the same text that inspired the Victorians. Not only does Plato provide a comprehensive explanation of why a republic needs a leadership class, he also provides a guide to producing one.</p>



<p>The great philosopher’s starting point is that government&nbsp;<em>matters</em>. A republic is rather like a ship at sea, he says. Whether the ship can survive the ever-changing hazards that confront us – storms, pirates, jagged rocks – depends on the quality of the ship’s leadership. If the ship is well run, then at least it has a chance; if it is badly run, then it will flounder and everybody aboard will drown. What does being ‘well-run’ mean? Plato asks a simple question: should we give the job of steering the ship safely to the members of the crew at large, when they can’t agree on where they’re headed and most of them don’t know the rudiments of navigation? Or should we give it to a captain who has spent his entire life studying&nbsp;‘the seasons of the year, the sky, the stars, the winds and other professional subjects’?</p>



<p>The metaphor of the ship is a way of driving home Plato’s wider point about the importance of ‘guardians’. Plato argues that a successful republic is run by a class of people whose job it is to think about the long-term success of the polis. What threats are there on the horizon? What trade-offs do we need to make in order to ensure success? How might we be scuppered by known unknowns and unknown unknowns? Despite being an aristocrat, Plato argued that potential guardians – or men of gold as he described them – might occur in every class of society – and indeed might be women as well as men. If they are to escape decay, successful societies have to re-allocate leadership positions in each generation. The second job is to train the guardians through a prolonged education that involves not just academic education but also character-training designed to ensure that guardians put the public good above private interests. Morality is arguably even more important than intellect because the leaders possess so much power over everybody’s lives: if they are corrupt they will not only lead the country in the wrong direction – from the light to the darkness in Plato’s view – but will also set a model of corruption that the rest of society will only too happily follow.</p>



<p>If a society run by educated guardians is the best sort of society, in Plato’s view, a society run by the masses is the worst. Plato conceded that democracy is in many ways the most attractive form of society,&nbsp;because it combines the maximum of opportunity for the regular citizen with the maximum of freedom. But these attractions are purely superficial – democracy is like a ‘coat of many colours’, he says, that looks good when you see it in the market but turns out to be threadbare after you’ve worn it a couple of times. Voters invariably favour the short-term over the long-term and the exciting over the wise. And they are usually drawn towards bad leaders – demagogues who can weave wonderful fantasies about the state’s future but are really nothing more than charlatans, lying their way to power or buying votes with other people’s money. Plato was particularly scathing about aristocrat-demagogues who enjoy the advantage of the best education that money can buy but nevertheless prefer to pander to the mob rather than to guide it to the light.</p>



<p>Democracy’s fetishisation of freedom inevitably gives way to anarchy. Fathers pander to their sons, teachers to their pupils, humans to animals, and ‘the minds of the citizens become so sensitive that the least vestige of restraint is resented as intolerable’. Anarchy produces class struggle, as the poor attack the rich and the rich retaliate; class struggle produces war and disorder. When all this becomes intolerable the masses will turn to a dictator who can restore order.</p>



<p>If tyrants are the unavoidable consequence of democracy, they are also the antithesis of philosopher kings. They regard power as an end in itself rather than a means to an end, and they are governed by their passions rather than their reason. Thus the paradox at the heart of tyranny: even though tyrants have absolute power over other people, they have no power over themselves. Slaves to their own passions – ‘ill-governed’ in their own souls as Plato puts it – they use their positions to inflict those passions on the entire population. A tyranny is a psycho-drama in which everyone is caught up in the tyrant’s raging ego.</p>



<p>Many of Plato’s suggestions for producing successful guardians strike us today as at the minimum bizarre.&nbsp;He believed that the guardians should be banned from getting married or owning private property in order to focus their minds on the common good. He was so keen on producing the best guardians that he advocated eugenic breeding programmes (guardians would be compensated for not getting marred by being allowed to participate in regular orgies with women selected for their brains and beauty). But even if he was far-fetched in his solutions, he was right in the problems that he identified. Guardians will cease to be guardians if they put themselves and their families among the public good, degrading public offices and turning the people against them.</p>



<p>William Gladstone, the greatest liberal reformer of the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, believed that, if the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century was the age of the rule of prerogative, and the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century one of rule by patronage, the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century should be ruled by virtue, and Plato was to be the new age’s guiding force.</p>



<p>Gladstone was so fluent in Classical Greek that, in 1858, he gave a speech to the inhabitants of the Ionian Islands (a British protectorate) in the language. Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby and the greatest school reformer of his age, adopted many of Plato’s signature ideas: that education was as much about shaping character as shaping intellect; that group loyalty should trump individual self-expression; and that physical education was as important as book learning. The two most influential civil servants of the age, Charles Trevelyan and Cyril Northcote, abolished patronage in the civil service and introduced open competition in order specifically to promote the rule of a Platonic ‘natural aristocracy’.</p>



<p>Benjamin Jowett, the master of Balliol from 1870 until his death in 1893, devoted his life to two great projects: producing a definitive edition of Plato&nbsp;and turning his college into a production line for Platonic guardians. Though he failed at his first task – his edition of&nbsp;<em>The Republic</em>&nbsp;was only completed after his death by his friend and biographer Lewis Campbell – he succeeded spectacularly at the second. Balliol became the leading educational institution in the empire.&nbsp;Jowett’s pupils included Lord Curzon, a future viceroy of India, Lord Grey, a future foreign secretary, Herbert Asquith, a future prime minister, Cosmo Gordon Lang, a future archbishop of Canterbury and Charles Gore, a future …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a startup founder, I frequently receive questions from friends, family, acquaintances, about how this mysterious fundraising process works. In short, <a href="https://www.startups.com/library/playbooks/funding/structure-your-fundraise"><u>raising venture capital</u></a> funds is a business deal in which you exchange equity, or a percentage of company ownership, for the capital your business needs to grow, in the form of investment funds.</p><p>Rapidly just raised our Seed round in February and now I am currently in the process of raising our Series A in the midst of COVID-19 and a faltering economy. From the early days of Rapidly, I knew the importance of enlisting help from a trusted accountant and I am now able to utilize our organized financial recordkeeping in my venture capital fundraising process.</p><h2>The Importance of Financial Planning Before Raising Capital</h2><p>As part of the venture capital process, it is mandatory that you understand your numbers, your growth rate, your burn rate. You should have a sense of what type of historical growth you need to be able to show in order to get a VC who is going to be interested in funding your company.</p><p>Founders want to quickly establish your cadence and relationship with your accountant or bookkeeper. Every company has to have this: either a third party person handling this, or you have a CFO function. You want to have a pulse on managing these things, with tracking revenues, costs, cash flow. Record keeping and paying your taxes are of utmost importance, for example with payroll, for both for due diligence by investors and general compliance purposes. Not getting your ducks in a row can have longer-lasting effects. Just this year with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), many businesses were ineligible due to having their employees classified as contractors rather than W-2 employees.</p><p>You want to have an accountant on your roster as early as you can, whether that’s when you incorporate your company, get your first paying customer, or hire your first employee. From Day 1, you should think about your financial recordkeeping and prepare for the future of your business by staying up-to-date with your books.</p><p>An added benefit of having a tax and accounting professional on your side is that they can bring their expertise of which bookkeeping and payroll software are going to be best for your business, rather than you trying to compare 10 different options.</p><h2>Your Due Diligence Essentials</h2><p>You want to have your base level due diligence items all together and ready before reaching out to investors. Even though you’ve prepared all documents before reaching out to investors, provide only what is asked for, when it is requested.&nbsp;</p><p>You will want to wait until after you receive a term sheet from investors to provide company financial information and documentation. You only want to show your company’s proprietary information to those who are serious about investing, not just someone who is considering investing in a competitor and wants your competitive intel. Prior to a term sheet, you would want to answer base level questions that they request, but not necessarily share your documents. I use Carta’s Deal Rooms feature just for transferring documents to potential investors.</p><h2>Required Due Diligence Items</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalization-table.asp"><u>Capitalization Table</u></a> with a summary of all shareholder equity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp#:~:text=The%20profit%20and%20loss%20(P%26L,synonymous%20with%20the%20income%20statement."><u>Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L)</u></a> statements with records of revenues, costs, expenses, in a given time period</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflowstatement.asp"><u>Cash Flow</u></a> statements with a summary of all incoming transaction through operations, investments, and financing</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp"><u>Balance Sheet</u></a> with the company’s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity</p></li><li><p><a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/modeling/types-of-financial-models/"><u>Financial Models</u></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><ul><li><p>One model if the business continues to grow month over month for 12 and 24 months</p></li><li><p>A second model if the business does not make any further month for the next 12 months, illustrating how long the business can run if things go south for our business during this time (very essential during a post-COVID world)</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Cohort analysis from your customer data</p><ul><li><p>Paid customers/users month over month</p></li><li><p>New users acquired month over month</p></li><li><p>Month over month churn</p></li><li><p>Month over month retention</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>How to Choose Your Accountant</h2><p>Timeliness and a good relationship with your accountant as additional questions or last-minute requests from investors come up during the fundraising process. This is why it’s best to have everything prepared before you begin your fundraising round. Shameless plug here Rapidly is a great starting point to start a long term relationship with a vetted accountant.</p><p>If you’re new to working with an accountant, you will want someone who has experience with startups, understands your revenue model, and your specific vertical. If you’re early stage and raising venture capital, you’re most likely not yet profitable, and your accountant should understand that in the short term your expenses are going to be more than your revenue.</p><p>Your accountant should be able to include stories from your user data (revenue, acquisition costs, churn rate, customer lifetime value, burn rate, revenue pipelines) in their financial modeling numbers of historical and projected KPI’s. Timeliness and a good relationship with your accountant as additional questions or last-minute requests from investors come up during the fundraising process. This is why it’s best to have everything prepared.</p></article></div>]]>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>The higher your busy time, the lower your maker time; but you can plan ahead more maker time by reducing your busy time.</em></p>
<p>The chart moves from 100% busy time to 100% maker time.</p>
<p>But 100% maker time is an idealistic state. We most likely will never get there. And that’s fine. Think of it as a form of stretch goal.</p>
<p>If you picture the top left corner of the graph, most busy people reside there: <em>busy, exhausting, working on back-to-back tasks</em>. So when a day starts out slow, guilt immediately follows because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>I should be doing a ton of work right now but I’m not! I really don’t feel like doing anything.”</em> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more realistic place to shoot for is somewhere, a little past the center where you’re still busy but you’ve set aside even more maker time. </p>
<p>Then on the far right is where you keep pushing yourself to — as you go more towards the right, it becomes much tougher to achieve 100%.</p>
<h2>Align tasks with your energy level</h2>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of an example week by Dillon:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
<p>Energy ramps out of the weekend — schedule low-demand tasks like setting goals, organizing, and planning.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>Peak of energy — tackle the most difficult problems, write, brainstorm, schedule your Make Time.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<p>Energy begins to ebb — schedule meetings, especially when consensus is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>Lowest energy level — do open-ended work, long-term planning, and relationship building.”</p>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that you set yourself ahead of time and this is particularly powerful if you manage others. </p>
<p>Less guilt;
More work;
Even more creativity.</p>
<h2>But I don’t manage anyone</h2>
<p>That’s ok. </p>
<p>You actually don’t have to be a manager to follow the high level principle. You don’t even have to work for a company.</p>
<p>You can adapt it for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Workouts</strong>: Days where you want to do a full work out. Plan ahead something simple for days when you notice your energy is typically low</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing</strong>: You have a book to write but feel lazy in the evenings. You can use that period to plan titles for the book, outline for chapters, etc. But then dedicate your high energy in the mornings to writing at least one pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meditation/House Chores/Job application/etc</strong>: Plan ahead for low-energy moments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Your next action</h2>
<p>Maybe for you, Mondays are not slow.</p>
<p>It could be Tuesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>The most important takeaway is that you should chunk your activities by different days of the week or different hours of the day and align them with your energy level. You can use your slow days to boost your creativity.</p>
<p>That way, you’ll feel more balance and control in how your week goes.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, simple little tweaks like this can add up to the big transformation you desire.</strong></p>
<p>Slow days are inevitable. Don’t just slog through.</p>
<p>Instead use them to get strategy and creative work done. If you’re like most busy people, you’re not doing a lot of thinking work anyways.</p>
<p>Change that – with this tiny shift in your approach.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A long time ago, I gave a talk in front of a full audience talking about BigchainDB, a company I worked for to create a (scalable) decentralized database. As we just had released our browser-compatible JavaScript driver, enthusiastically, I told the audience: "... and so by using our driver from within the browser, your app won't need a backend anymore"!</p>
<p>That must have been around 2017 when I first discovered Metamask, and started drinking Ethereum's web3 cool-aid. Arguably, web3 quickly became something extraordinary. All of a sudden, users could download a browser extension and directly interact with a public network. In a sense, it still is extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you have an extension like Metamask installed in your browser today, you can visit sites on the web that allow you to do the craziest things with your digital money. An excellent recent example of this are DeFi (short for "Decentralized Finance") websites. They allow a user to engage in trading cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity, and peer to peer lending. With the click of a button and no mandatory signups, you're able to pool thousands of dollars. That is super cool and confirms the viability of the web3 vision.</p>
<p>But actually, what is the web3 vision? It may be that there never was such a thing in the first place. All I know is that someone named a library "web3.js". Developers use it to talk to remote or local Ethereum nodes when working in a browser environment (JavaScript).</p>
<p>On a web3-enabled website, when a user now clicks a button to, e.g., pool ether in a smart contract, most calculations are supported by the web3.js library that periodically talks to an Ethereum node. Ultimately web3.js allows the user to send the transaction to the node to transfer the user's money.</p>
<p>Often, a key-management program, like Metamask, is running on the user's browser. It allows the user to sign transactions with the same key on different websites.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that's web3. It's supposed to be a play on words regarding "web 2.0". Web 2.0 is the upgrade of web standards that gave us modern single-page applications and dynamic AJAX loading. And Web3? An advancement towards what exactly? Money websites?</p>
<p>Indeed, if you were capable of cleaning your mind of specific memories, specifically, let's say you could do <code>grep -l web3 brain | xargs rm</code>. And then someone asked you how you'd envision a blockchain-based and smart-contract-enabled web3; you'd likely describe an ecosystem vastly different to what it is today. You'd think about peer-2-peer networks, light clients, and renewed web standards. That's precisely not web3.</p>
<p>In today's experience it will instead be mostly shitty react websites that crash or stop working when you've neglected to install Metamask (or other key-management plugins). Opening a web3 website's network console, you'll see that it's making an excessive amount of RPC request to an Ethereum full node. Sorry, I meant to say Infura node, a hugely-popular cloud provider hosting Ethereum full nodes. That's kinda stupid.</p>
<p>And since Metamask allows developers to prompt the user for specific contract calls, what's even more stupid, is that all your money may be at the risk of continually getting stolen with the accidential click of a button. Either by someone hacking the website's server. Or by the website provider becoming corrupt themselves. Or simply because a website pretends to do X when it does Y (stealing all your money).</p>
<p>But instead of continuing to rant, I'd now like to now point out what I think should change about web3:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should stop building key-management plugins and start thinking about a standardizable web API. We must stop training our users to install shitty browser plugins!</li>
<li>We need to make light clients work as soon as possible and become independent from third-party services like thegraph and Infura.</li>
<li>We need to improve our client libraries (ethers.js and web3.js) by dramatically simplifying them and making them bug-free (god damn it!)!</li>
<li>We need to take advantage of some of the blockchain's fundamental properties. Most data is immutable so let's start caching things.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I think we should stop focusing all of our attention on bumping the web's version number. Maybe we should reconsider writing more backends. We should promote more work on permissionless networks like Open Gas Station Network that allow developers to upgrade a user's experience. And, we should start thinking of a machine network of blockchains more often. In many ways, web3 was just a cool demo. But let's come up with something better. Just imagine what happens once there's a deeper integration of money into computer systems!</p>

      <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unlike the Terminator-like humanoids that may come to mind when you hear the phrase ‘killer robots’, lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) can take many forms that are more like the weapons deployed today, such as drones, tank turrets, submarines, missile-defense systems, and sentry robots. The common thread pulling LAWS together is lethal autonomy: the ability for these weapons to select and engage with objects, including people or military targets, without human help.</li>
  <li>With AI and robotics technology rapidly advancing, experts are warning that so-called ‘killer robots’ (or more formally, LAWS) are just years, not decades, away from the battlefield. To date no country has deployed LAWS to the battlefield, although at least a dozen are developing them and the technology is advanced enough to do so.</li>
  <li>The US military is a world leader in the technical as well as ethical and legal development of killer robots. In 2012, it issued Directive 3000.09 codifying the rule that people hold the reins and retain meaningful control over the use of LAWS. Then, earlier this year the Department of Defense adopted a set of 5 ethical principles to guide the development and use of autonomous weapon systems.</li>
  <li>While the US is a leader in the area, the AI arms race is global: at least 12 nations have acknowledged that they are developing LAWS, and global spending on automated weapon systems is projected to reach $16 billion by 2025.</li>
  <li>The AI arms race is accelerating, because no strong state wants to tie its military’s hands from using powerful technology by agreeing to an international ban. Despite warnings that killer robots are driving a third revolution in warfare after gunpowder and nuclear weapons, states and international institutions are struggling to agree on how to regulate LAWS, if at all. Diplomats have been meeting at the UN for six years to discuss killer robots, but little progress towards a ban, treaty, or arms control agreement has been made.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>For many people, “killer robots” bring to mind dystopian images from science fiction, such as the human-like androids of <em>Bladerunner</em> or Arnold Schwartzenegger’s intimidating Terminator robot. While such robots that are frequently portrayed in the media are still entirely fictional, real-world “killer robots” — or more formally, lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS) — are very much in the process of being developed. LAWS are systems that can select and fire on targets without human help, and prototypes exist in a range of weapons and military vehicles, including drones, submarines, tank turrets, missile-defense systems, and stationary sentry robots. While such systems are not widely deployed yet, many governments are actively developing such technology, so it is crucial to consider its implications and necessary restrictions for it now.</p>

</figure>

<p>In fact, in 2015 more than 3000 experts signed <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/?cn-reloaded=1">“Autonomous Weapons: an Open Letter from AI &amp; Robotics Researchers”</a>, which warned that “Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has reached a point where the deployment of such systems is — practically if not legally — feasible within years, not decades, and the stakes are high: autonomous weapons have been described as the third revolution in warfare, after gunpowder and nuclear arms.” They specifically warned of the dangers of the uncontrolled spread of LAWS — likening them to the <a href="https://theconversation.com/worlds-deadliest-inventor-mikhail-kalashnikov-and-his-ak-47-126253">Kalaknishkovs</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> of the 21st century. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-33686581">Researchers</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17786080/united-nations-un-autonomous-killer-robots-regulation-conference">diplomats</a> have warned that LAWS <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2016-09/features/stopping-%E2%80%98killer-robots%E2%80%99-why-now-time-ban-autonomous-weapons-systems">pose a destabilizing threat</a> to the international order with five core risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lowering the threshold for conflict because fewer lives are at stake;</li>
  <li>carrying out assassinations anonymously and remotely;</li>
  <li>amplifying terrorist attacks; - subduing populations or selectively killing a particular ethnic group; and</li>
  <li>locking competing algorithms into loops of conflict escalation — possibly nuclear conflict — without a person being able to break the cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these warnings, 30 global arms manufacturers <a href="https://qz.com/1746154/lacking-regulation-firms-on-track-to-make-killer-robots-reality/">have been identified</a> by the peace nonprofit Pax <a href="https://www.paxforpeace.nl/media/files/pax-report-slippery-slope.pdf">to be actively developing LAWS</a>.</p>

<p>Few laws exist to constrain the use of killer robots. At the international level, no law or policy deals specifically with LAWS or other automated systems. However, since this technology will be used by the military to kill, certain international rules and rights apply that restrict all weapons of war; like any weapon, these technologies are governed by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/killer-robots-and-the-laws-of-war-1383521594">the laws of war</a> and the use of force, which state that no weapon can be used to kill civilians indiscriminately or without a clear military objective behind the strike. However, experts stress that LAWS may lower the threshold to conflict and cannot be guaranteed to accurately discriminate civilians from soldiers, so the laws of war and use of force rules do not adequately address the threat LAWS pose. A treaty or arms control agreement constraining the use of LAWS, they argue, is necessary.</p>

<p>Despite the growing danger of LAWS being unleashed on the battlefield, diplomats <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-rights-killer-robots/nations-dawdle-on-agreeing-rules-to-control-killer-robots-in-future-wars-idUSKBN1ZG151">are still scrambling</a> at the United Nations (UN) to ban or bring LAWS under an arms control agreement. But, major powers, including the US, China, and Russia, are blocking progress towards a framework of any kind. In this piece, we’ll survey the state of killer robots (or, LAWS), as well as current efforts on their regulatory framework.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-killer-robots">What are “killer robots”?</h2>

<p>In the Terminator movies, John Conner is on a mission to save the world from a terrible future: the US military’s AI system, Skynet, becomes self-aware, starts a global nuclear war, and then builds an army of robotic soldiers to finish killing off mankind. These robot soldiers make their evil intent clear, marching with rifles in hand and radiating malevolence from their red eyes. In real life, however, spotting a “killer robot” is not so simple.</p>

<p>AI’s general-purpose nature may be attractive to the military, but it also makes pinning down what exactly is a killer robot complicated. The common thread pulling them together is lethal autonomy, although the specific weapon is different in each case. But, defining autonomy in LAWS is more complicated than it seems. Drones, for example, display levels of autonomy ranging from none (human piloting it and selecting and firing on targets), partial (flying autonomously but a person selects targets), to total independence from human operators. Plus, the term LAWS can describe a variety of possible weapon systems, from sentry robots and other self-defense systems to offensive ones like drones and wingmen for fighter pilots. As Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence and expert on its military applications, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/21/18691459/killer-robots-lethal-autonomous-weapons-ai-war">explained</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When people hear ‘killer robots,’ they think Terminator, they think science fiction, they think of something that’s far away […] Instead, it’s simpler technologies that are much nearer, and that are being prototyped as we speak.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While AI and robotics have made rapid progress over the past decade, the technology is still <a href="https://www.ausa.org/articles/changing-way-soldiers-fight-and-survive-ai-battlefield">too limited</a> to replicate everything a human soldier can do. Machine learning algorithms are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/greedy-brittle-opaque-and-shallow-the-downsides-to-deep-learning/">brittle, biased, and vulnerable</a> to both hacks and a <a href="https://openai.com/blog/adversarial-example-research/">more subtle kind</a> of manipulation called <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/8/18297410/ai-tesla-self-driving-cars-adversarial-machine-learning">adversarial attacks</a>. Likewise, robots in the field struggle to move like soldiers do, communicate with them by listening to commands and reading body language, and distinguish between enemy soldiers and civilians. What machines are good at is automating specific tasks a soldier might do. Keeping watch, collecting and analyzing information, monitoring the battlefield, driving a tank or targeting and shooting at people — these are areas where AI is making its impact on war.</p>

<p>Just in the US, for example, nearly every branch of the military is developing LAWS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Army is building a 50-mm turret called <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2019/06/army-to-test-robotic-gun-bruce-jette/">Advanced Targeting and Lethality Automated System</a> (ATLAS) to put on tanks. ATLAS can autonomously detect targets, determine if they are hostile, and train its cannon on them with superhuman speed and accuracy.</li>
  <li>The Navy has installed an automated version of its Aegis missile system that reacts faster than humans can to shoot down incoming missiles or manned targets. The branch has also <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/dsei/2019/09/10/the-us-navy-just-had-a-major-breakthrough-with-autonomous-weapons/">sailed a ship</a> from California to Hawaii and back without human help.</li>
  <li>The Air Force is a pioneer in developing lethal autonomy in drones. It has flown an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/us/pentagon-artificial-intelligence-terminator.html">autonomous version</a> of the infamous Predator drone that can track and kill targets as well as <a href="https://www.airforcemag.com/article/the-looming-swarm/">shown off swarms</a> of small drones that can communicate with each other and act collectively. Pushing automated lethality to its limits, the Air Force has gone as far as to propose pairing fighter pilots with robot wingmen to fly and fight alongside them. The Predator drone has been at the forefront of the unmanned system revolution in the military; one modern warfare expert Peter Singer has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2012/11/19/losing-humanity/case-against-killer-robots">described it</a> as “merely the first generation—the equivalent of the Ford Model T or the Wright Brothers’ Flyer.”<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> In August, foreshadowing an evolution in drones that will take them beyond being the Model T, an AI-powered fighter pilot <a href="http://ford/">beat</a> a human pilot in a series of simulated F-16 dogfights.</li>
  <li>The US is projected <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12713">to spend</a> $17.5 billion on drones between 2017-2021, including 3,447 new unmanned ground, sea, and aerial systems despite already owning 20,000 autonomous vehicles. Each branch is adapting autonomy to fit their needs. In the air, sea, and on land, the development of LAWS is transforming how the US military fights.</li>

<p>While the US is a leader in developing the building blocks of killer robots, it is not alone in its pursuit of LAWS. Global military spending on automated weapon systems and AI, narrowly defined, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1758-5899.12713">is projected</a> to reach $16 and $18 billion respectively by 2025.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p><span>I recently came across a question on Quora:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“How do you know if you’re going to be successful?”&nbsp;</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>Scrolling through the replies, one story caught my eye.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectorquintanilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hector Quintanilla</a>, a brilliant startup expert and successful entrepreneur with nearly three decades of experience helping entrepreneurs build their businesses.</span></p>
<p><span>It went something like this:</span></p>
<p><i><span>“You can predict with outstanding accuracy how successful you will be.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>It’s a very easy formula to understand — yet difficult to execute.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>What’s the secret?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>We become like the people we hang out with.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Analyze your environment. Write down all the characteristics that you like and dislike. Well, that’s exactly where you’re heading.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>We’re social creatures and incredibly influenced by our cultures. This culture gets immersed in our behaviours, which are mostly unconscious.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to become a successful entrepreneur? Surround yourself with successful people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to be happy? Surround yourself with happy people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to be healthy? Surround yourself with healthy people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to become more confident? Surround yourself with confident people.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Do you want to fly with eagles? Surround yourself with eagles! Eagles don’t fly with pigeons.”</span></i></p>
<p><span>It sounds like very simple advice. And it is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s also </span><b>incredibly powerful</b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We often talk about the importance of surrounding yourself with the right people – whether it’s co-founders, advisors, mentors, or investors.</span></p>
<p><span>Take Hector, he was surrounded by the right people from a young age. A third-generation entrepreneur, he grew up with the entrepreneurial mindset. Which is why I invited him to share his story in this expert interview.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And I have to say, I ended up with a bit more than I bargained for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As well as sharing his insights surrounding the entrepreneurial mindset; he shared the exact framework he uses when coaching and mentoring entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span>But first, let’s get to know Hector a little better.</span></p>

<h4><span>Q: Did you always want to become an entrepreneur?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A: </b><span>Yes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was lucky, I was born into an entrepreneurial family. My grandfather was a successful entrepreneur, my father was a successful entrepreneur; so I was born into this entrepreneurial mindset. It wasn’t that my father was teaching me </span><b>how </b><span>to become a successful entrepreneur, but in many ways, it was our family mindset.</span></p>
<p><span>It also helped that I was a misfit to the educational system.</span></p>
<p><span>So, throughout my school years, my focus was never in academics. I was always searching for different types of businesses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, back when I was in college, it was popular to share notes with colleagues. So you would go to the Xerox copy-center. There was a significant need that I thought I could solve. I tried to open a shop doing that outside my college, but it never really launched.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My next idea actually launched but I learned a bitter-sweet lesson from it.</span></p>
<p><span>My college had a&nbsp; considerable problem when it came to parking. But I kept seeing these vacant lots nearby. So I contacted one of the lot owners and said: “I want to rent this space from you to launch a business providing parking spaces.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My father co-signed the lease with the owner and we had a great start. But after the first year, the lot owner didn’t renew my lease; he decided to keep the business for himself. Big lesson there!</span></p>
<p><span>Finding opportunities to launch a business – it was, and still is, my true passion.</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“I was a misfit to the educational system. My focus was never in academics but searching for different types of businesses”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>My cousin had a similar mindset as me, and we were quite close – So we undertook a program at college called </span><i><span>The Entrepreneurs’ Program</span></i><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>It was good fun. The teacher would guide us on how to do market research, among other things. It was very practical, we would go out, talk to people, analyse businesses, create projections for a business’s potential, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Off the back of that, my cousin and I reached out to a franchise that did shoe repairs. We travelled to the south of Mexico to see if we could make a deal to open one in our city.</span></p>
<p><span>That didn’t work, so we found one of their competitors and made an arrangement with them and set up shop. It was going well, but we noticed our customers needed other services. So we added clothing alteration and dry cleaning. We put a concentrated focus on those services, especially with female clients – as they made up 80% of our client base at the time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>That business worked so well that it’s still running today, 26 years later</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This startup was going on while I was still at college, so it’s safe to say my focus wasn’t in school.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I was studying civil engineering because my father was a passionate architect. He had his own construction business and I always thought maybe I need to continue the family business.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a big lesson there. </span><b>I was trying to meet my dad’s expectations, not mine</b><span>. We will talk more about that later when we talk about what I call </span><i><span>The Three Pillars of Success.</span></i></p>
<h4><span>Q: What, in your opinion, is the essence of entrepreneurship?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A:</b><span> There’s this common idea that entrepreneurs are born from their DNA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve thought about it and I’ve come to realise that</span><b> there is a successful entrepreneur inside of every single one of us</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, the big key here is finding the freedom to pursue your desire.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We all have dreams, but most people don’t take the leap because they have a complete lack of self-belief. Or because of cultural restrictions in our home, family, social surroundings, schools etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, it’s logical that if my father goes down a path that has been good for him, he wants me to take the same path.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are coming from the industrial age, where the value of labour was very high, due to the scarcity of qualified workers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the last generation that meant: a safe secure job with benefits guaranteed a good life. A car, a house, put your kids through college, etc. Climbing the corporate ladder was enough.</span></p>
<p><span>This presents a lack of freedom, however. I was blessed to be born into a home where it was ok to try new things and I was supported by my family.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“I’ve come to realise that there is a successful entrepreneur inside of every single one of us. However, the big key is finding the freedom to pursue your desire.”&nbsp;</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>We all have different chains stopping us from gaining that freedom:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Our culture</span></li>
<li><span>Families&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Environment&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>But more importantly, are the chains inside of us. Ultimately they’re the most significant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our beliefs control our actions. </span><b>If you don’t believe you can accomplish something you won’t even try it</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s no magic thing about this idea of the entrepreneurial mindset. It’s a lot of common sense. But you need to dive into the water and start swimming – or you’ll never become a successful entrepreneur.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Now’s not the right time.” “I have too much responsibility, I can’t do it now.” “If I do this now I will lose money, I can’t afford to do it.”</span></p>
<p><b>These are all things that will limit your actions.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Whether the restriction is internal or external, you need to get free of it.</span></p>

<h4><span>Q: You have a framework “The Three Pillars of Success.” What is it and how did it come about?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A: </b><span>It’s been maybe 10/12 years that I’ve been playing with the idea of helping other people start the entrepreneurial journey. It’s something I’m very passionate about.</span></p>
<p><span>In sharing my experiences with my </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Hector-Quintanilla" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Quora community</span></a><span> I started learning more about the people I was reaching. Through their comments and reactions, I started to get a sense of what people needed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I sensed a lack of understanding of entrepreneurship and all the misconceptions that come with it, like “how risky entrepreneurship is”.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Entrepreneurship comes with its risks, but what’s risky is bad decisions – not the entrepreneurial journey itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s like investment, many misunderstand that </span><b>real investing is not gambling</b><span>. I’m not guessing if my investment will make money or not. I </span><i><span>know</span></i><span> my investment will make money because I did all the research and due diligence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Don’t get me wrong, things can change; none of us expected COVID-19 for instance. But I’m still in control of where my money is going. I can control my assets in many ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>That’s not gambling; neither is entrepreneurship</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Entrepreneurship is about making logical, wise decisions.”</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>The Three Pillars of success is a process which allows you to check things off a list and reduce the risk dramatically. </span></p>
<h4><span>Q: Let’s talk about the first Pillar: Alignment. This is about the avoidance of working against yourself. Can you expand on this a bit?&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><b>A:</b><span> If you go back in history, every single company on earth started with the vision of one person. There are partnerships, Steve Jobs &amp; Steve Wozniak for example. However, the vision came from one person, Jobs; he saw the opportunity, Wozniak had the technical ability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is very important for us to understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of people come to me with this idea of starting a business by inventing something new. And that’s great, but the ability to</span><b> see a need</b><span> in the market and </span><b>turn that solution into a business</b><span> are two very different things. That’s what a successful entrepreneur does. They build business models around innovation:</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>“Pillar #1 is you. Taking the passion, purpose and belief you have and knowing you picked the right battle. It’s critical you play to </span></i><b><i>your </i></b><i><span>strengths.”</span></i></span></h3>

<p>Having built the early prototype for Proxycurl's Linkedin API, I know a little bit about scraping Linkedin profiles in scale. In this tutorial, I will share my experience building a Linkedin profile scraper that works in 2020, and I hope you will find it useful.</p>
<p>To put this tutorial in context, we will preface it with the problem of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to crawl 1 million Linkedin profiles and then scrape the pages to structured data?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking down the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to crawl a million Linkedin profiles and fetch their on-page HTML content</li>
<li>How to scrape the HTML content from a Linkedin profile to structured data</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part1howtocrawl1mlinkedinprofilesforhtmlcode">Part 1: How to crawl 1M Linkedin profiles for HTML code</h2>
<p>Before we embark on the quest to crawl a million profiles, let's start with crawling ten profiles. There are only two ways to crawl ten Linkedin profiles for scraping:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a user logged into Linkedin. (A "logged in user")</li>
<li>Or, as a user that is not logged into Linkedin. (An "anonymous user.")</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1aaccessinglinkedinprofilesasananonymoususer">1A: Accessing Linkedin profiles as an anonymous user</h3>
<p>It requires luck to access a Linkedin profile without being logged into Linkedin.</p>
<p>In my experience, you might be able to access the first profile as an anonymous user if you have not recently clicked into any Linkedin profiles.</p>
<p>Even if you succeed viewing a public profile anonymously in your first attempt, more likely or not, you will be greeted with the dreaded Authwall on your second profile visit.</p>
<figure><img src="https://accountgram-production.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/nubelaco_ghost/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-09-at-1.02.41-AM.png" alt=""></figure><p><strong>What is the Authwall and how do you circumvent it?</strong></p>
<p>The Authwall exists to block web scraping from users who are not logged into Linkedin.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you visit a public profile from a non-residential IP address, such as from a data center IP address, you will get the Authwall.</li>
<li>If you visit a public profile without any cookies in your browser session (aka incognito mode), you will get the Authwall.</li>
<li>If you are visiting a public profile from a non-major browser, you will get the Authwall.</li>
<li>If you are visiting a public profile multiple times, you will get the Authwall.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons that you will be greeted with the Authwall when you are crawling anonymously. But there is one way you can reliably bypass it -- crawl Linkedin as Googlebot. If you can access a Linkedin public profile page from an IP address that belongs to Google, you can consistently fetch an available Linkedin profile without the Authwall.</p>
<p><strong>What does an IP address from Google mean?</strong></p>
<p>It is an IP address that resolves reversely to *.googlebot.com. See this <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/80553">Google support page</a> for a clear definition. And no, IP addresses from Google Cloud instances do not work.</p>
<p><strong>But, there is one page on Linkedin that you can crawl without restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Put yourself in the shoes of a Linkedin executive. What makes you money? Profile data. Which is the Authwall is used to lock up profile data.</p>
<p>What else makes Linkedin money? Jobs! Linkedin makes money when companies list jobs on Linkedin. These companies will return to Linkedin again and again if Linkedin succeeds at matching great candidates to their job postings.</p>
<p>Job profiles on Linkedin are not blocked by the Authwall to maximize page views.</p>
<h3 id="1baccessinglinkedinprofilesloggedintolinkedin">1B: Accessing Linkedin profiles logged into Linkedin</h3>
<p>You and I are probably not Googlers, which means we do not have access to the range of addresses belonging to Googlebot. But there is respite.</p>
<p>You can log into Linkedin to reliably access Linkedin profiles. However, as tempting as it may be, I highly recommend that you not use your personal Linkedin profile to perform a bulk profile crawl for scraping purposes. You do not want your personal Linkedin profile to be blocked.</p>
<p>And it will be blocked should you scrape past a certain threshold or when Linkedin detects abnormal (automated) behavior in your account.</p>
<p>But yes, log into your Linkedin profile, and you can crawl ten profiles with no problems. And that brings me to the next section -- getting from 10 profiles to 1M profiles.</p>
<p><strong>Can I crawl 1M Linkedin profiles to scrape by creating many Linkedin accounts?</strong></p>
<p>It is only natural to veer towards the belief that you can build a Linkedin scraper if you manage a pool of disposable Linkedin accounts. You are not wrong. Building a pool of workers with disposable Linkedin accounts is indeed a feasible method if and only if humans meticulously manage each Linkedin account.</p>
<p>Once you begin automated crawls on any Linkedin account, you will start encountering random Recaptcha challenges on accounts that will keep an account locked until they are solved.</p>
<p>Each Linkedin account in your scraping pool will also require a unique residential IP address.<br>
<strong>The short answer is yes</strong>. You can crawl 1M Linkedin profiles with many Linkedin accounts with residential IP addresses.</p>
<h3 id="recapwhatyouneedtodotocrawl1mprofiles">Recap: What you need to do to crawl 1M profiles</h3>
<p>The first step to scraping is to get HTML code of profiles in scale. In this article, we put a number to "scale." One million profiles. There are only a few ways to crawl 1M Linkedin profiles, and they are</p>
<ol>
<li>Access Linkedin from an IP address the resolves as Googlebot</li>
<li>Manage a large pool of workers logged in as individual Linkedin account, with each account sitting on residential IP addresses</li>
<li>Use Proxycurl API -- see the next section.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="usingproxycurlapitofetch1mlinkedinprofiles">Using Proxycurl API to fetch 1M Linkedin profiles</h3>
<p>Proxycurl is an offering we built that provides a managed service to scrape Linkedin profiles in real-time.</p>
<p>If you ask me which is the best way to scrape Linkedin profiles, then I will tell you in a very biased way to use Proxycurl's API. Specifically, the Linkedin Person Profile Endpoint that is available with our Linkedin API. When you make an API request to our Linkedin Person Profile Endpoint, our system performs a live crawl and returns the user profile in structured data back to you.</p>
<h2 id="part2ihavehtmlcodeofaprofilepagehowdoiscrapecontentoffit">Part 2: I have HTML code of a profile page, how do I scrape content off it?</h2>
<p>Now that you have 1M profiles, it is time to get the content out of the HTML code into structured data. To convert HTLM pages to structured data is what I define as "scraping." Crawling profiles gets you a bunch of pages as HTML code. Scraping turn pages of HTML code into machine-readable structured data, like this:</p>

				<p>Axial operates a confidential online marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of privately held small and medium sized businesses. The platform is 100% software enabled and includes tools and recommendation engines to empower both buyers and sellers to discover, connect and transact with one another. By expanding the reach of both buyers and sellers and eliminating hundreds of hours of manual time spent pursuing an offline transaction process allows deals with the most merit to rise to the top. The platform goes beyond matching the correct individuals and focuses on facilitating success at many levels. A key example of this is the platform's ability to facilitate real human to human interactions with communication on the platform itself.</p><blockquote><em>“Axial at its core is a specialized matching engine and communication platform.”</em></blockquote><p>The ability for the platform to connect people on a deeper level is what has made it a successful medium for completed deals and a major contributor to democratizing capital markets. As Zach Werheim, Director of Engineering at Axial, puts it, “one big goal is to be able to help people where they need it — for those who, otherwise, would never be able to get it."</p><p>Zach is a prominent software engineer and tech leader who has led a number of engineering teams. He, along with the rest of the Axial team, were quick to recognize the rapidly evolving market conditions in the way people communicate. The mindset of their users was changing quickly, and it was critical to provide them with industry best practices and features.</p><p>The Axial platform has served their customers for over 10 years. In that time they’ve endeavored to maintain best practices while evolving with emerging technologies. Their philosophy of pushing innovation results in a couple of issues arising that the team must address.</p><p><em><strong>1. Ensuring institutional knowledge isn’t lost over time.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>2. Making it easy to adopt the newest best technologies.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>3. Making their tooling accessible to their developers.</strong></em></p><p>Applications being built and improved over the course of a decade are always at risk of institutional knowledge being lost. It is paramount that developer and operations workflows and processes are common knowledge and not siloed. Additionally, over the course of the last decade, there are a new set of tools and processes which represent best practices. A core facet of engineering at Axial is to adopt the latest best practices to empower their development team to perform at their highest.</p><blockquote><br><em>Zach was on a mission to make it easier for their development team to adopt optimal tooling without silos and individual points of failure. This would empower their dev team to make the best technology choices while ensuring that the tool knowledge was collaborative and distributed. The solution was creating their own workflows meshed with the optimal tools for their day-to-day operations.</em><br></blockquote><p>After evaluating multiple tools with limited success, the team came across <a href="https://cto.ai/platform">The Ops Platform by CTO.ai</a>. The Ops Platform allowed them to start building solutions immediately by creating and automating developer workflows. These workflows were sharable with the entire team and could plug into any specific developer tooling that was necessary. They did this via Slack workflows and the CTO.ai SlackOps capability. Axial built 3 initial Ops to empower their engineering teams right away: The Dev Op, The Vault Op, and The Cluster Op.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="1-the-dev-op">1. The Dev Op</h3><p>The engineering team leverages VMs which run in AWS, which also run most of their services for development. Their Dev Command controls the state of their DevBox for AWS cost savings. When the development team isn’t active, it can easily be turned off or turn on, on demand. The team also implemented an automatic shut off. Because it’s built as an Op, the team can run these suites of commands directly from Slack and avoid having to interface with the AWS Console or other specific services.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WJ21lVtgdBCuga-WYA2xJc8h3LQUojaozdTE7cuiVgfVYtDC80LbgJRN0D1_gMul3ekbXDjS3zMwLXszGVPEGzwMOWVcRYSO6nXbTRbYIfw90_7zeRCAnBtiEZhIjThFDvNPGC3A"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: html--><br>

The <em>Dev </em>Op specifically helped save on their AWS bill by making it easy for the team to activate development services only when necessary. Across the 5 DevBoxes, Zach is able to save over 12 hours of uptime per day, which equates to a savings of over $5,900 annually. The Ops Platform made it simple to build—not only to save money, but also to streamline development for the rest of the engineering team and save developer hours.</p><blockquote><em>“Without CTO.ai, we would have to adopt the bare minimum tooling. Anything new would have to be written in a language our team was familiar with and we’d be running scripts manually. Having this technology available is going to make it easier to develop dev operations around new systems. It’s definitely going to be a big advantage for us going forward”</em></blockquote><div><p>Zach plans to continue to build key Ops to empower the rest of his team. Specifically, a production release pipeline. In addition, there are a lot of fragmented utility scripts their team uses to run various operations. These scripts currently sit in a folder and eventually become outdated as infrastructure changes. “Opifying” these would allow them to be version controlled and give the entire team more visibility. Zach has also thought about ways to empower other departments of the organization with Ops. One of their next plans for Ops is to build an “extremely simple and impossible to screw up” SlackOp to empower their marketing department to perform an operation they would usually need the assistance of engineering for. This Op would be trackable, so the engineering team would have visibility into what is being run, but the marketing team would be unblocked to continue their tasks. </p><p>Adopting Ops has allowed Axial to immediately reduce their cloud spend, enable easier adoption of new technologies, and even open the door to empowering non-engineers to run operations. Ultimately, this allows the engineering team to focus on their core competency in the pursuit of their own market innovation instead of spending time and resources on infrastructure and tooling.</p></div><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Contact us to understand how much time and money workflows can save your team:</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--[if lte IE 8]>

				<div>
				
				
				<div><p><span>In the winter of 1938, deep into the Depression,&nbsp;eight-year-old Verne was put on a train and sent 2,000 miles east, to the Ontario School for the Blind. It was when Verne was in the school’s hospital for six weeks with scarlet fever that he first heard the sound of a piano being tuned – the intervals being stretched and shortened. It was a pinging sound, not quite musical, and hardly melodic.</span></p>
<p><span>Once he had recovered,Verne sought out the school’s tuning shop. As it happened, he had a near perfect ear, and he studied the craft of piano tuning with rigor and determination.</span></p>
<p><span>Years later, Verne often took to quoting his tuning teacher, J. D. Ansell, whose favorite aphorism was “The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary.” To give Verne experience, Ansell started taking his young protégé into town to tune pianos in private homes. Verne was allowed to keep the money – $2.50 per piano, and sometimes, when he got lucky, $3.00 – which he put toward some basic tools: a tuning wrench, a tuning fork, needle-nose pliers, gauges for measuring the diameter of piano wire, and rubber wedges for muting strings.</span></p>
<p><span>After graduating from high school at age 19, Verne knew his best chance at a job was to find work as a chipper in one of the many piano factories in Toronto (in the early 20th century the city directory listed no fewer than sixteen piano manufacturers). The chippers were the first tuners to work on a newly strung piano, so incomplete in construction that it still had no keys. Those initial tunings are done, first with a pitch fork, then by ear, by plucking the strings with a small chip of wood.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne started out as an apprentice chipper in the factory of the Winter Company, one of piano manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span>He had a fishing tackle box that he had converted to a tuner’s toolbox. Over the years Verne collected dozens of tools. Some he bought from old-timers, and others he adapted from other trades. He had surgical forceps and dental explorers, which made dandy hooks, opticians’ screwdrivers for adjusting harpsichords, barber scissors for trimming felt, and shoemaker pegs for plugging holes. From the welding trade he took soapstone, a dry lubricant for the buckskin that can squeak in the action of older pianos.</span></p>
<p><span>After being laid off, Verne decided to go door-to-door, tuning pianos. He was systematic, choosing a sequence of different neighborhoods around Toronto that he could reach by street car. Verne soon grew bolder and began cold-calling at sergeants’ messes,&nbsp;asylums, and prisons. He would walk a mile and a half in a snowstorm to tune a piano, and charge $3 for a tuning. He was lucky to get one tuning a day. “That’s how things were,” he recalled years later. “I was glad to get the work. During that time you did what you could.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 1952, at the age of 21, Verne was hired as a fine-tuner in the Heintzman factory, then the largest piano manufacturer in Canada.&nbsp;Verne’s tuning always stood out, even when he was tuning pianos for the first time. To trained ears, the quality of Verne’s tuning was always superior.</span></p>
<p><span>In 1961, he moved to the T. Eaton Co., to take over as the concert tuner. Verne liked to think he could take a piano beyond mere sound, into realms of color. And he liked to think he was giving people a glimpse of that color every time he tuned a piano. Muriel Mussen, who ran the concert department, sat in a small office off the showroom floor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;came to recognize Verne’s spare style of tuning whenever she heard it. Unlike many tuners, who banged a key as hard as they could, he kept it gentle, careful not to hit the key any harder than he had to. Halfway into a piano, Verne would often hear Miss Mussen call out, “I know it’s you tuning out there, Verne.”</span></p>
<p><span>One afternoon about a year after Verne started at Eaton’s,&nbsp;Miss Mussen sent him across town to Glenn Gould’s apartment to tune Gould’s old Chickering. All Gould wanted, he told Verne, was for the tuner to do what had been done hundreds of times before: get the piano into playable condition, if only for the time being. But Verne refused, telling Gould that the tuning pins were so loose they needed to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne’s stubborn insistence on doing things his way had endeared him to Gould, and the encounter galvanized what was to become a decades-long association between a pianist and his technician.</span></p>
<p><span>Verne tuned for many famous musicians over the years, including Duke Ellington, Arthur Rubinstein, Rudolf Serkin, Victor Borge, and Liberace. But it was the business he got from Gould that eventually enabled him to quit Eaton’s employ and sustain his family for two decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Each tolerated the other’s idiosyncracies, which were in ample evidence in both men. Gould’s quirks, of course, were legion and legendary. One of their earliest conversations was about Verne’s physical limitations. “I can’t see very well, but I get the job done,” Verne told Gould. And Gould replied that of this he had no doubt. Nothing further on the topic was ever said.</span></p>

Occasionally, he'll pop under the shower-head to tame his bed-head or rinse away some actual dirt from his skin. But he doesn't shampoo his hair&nbsp;or lather his body.</p>  <p>"You don't look and smell the same as after you go through an elaborate skin-care regimen or, you know, have lathered yourself in&nbsp;fine-smelling soaps. But you don't smell terrible either," Hamblin&nbsp;told <em>As it Happens</em> host Carol Off.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"You're just sort of in an equilibrium. And you smell, as I'm told, like a human."</p>  <p>Hamblin is a preventative medicine doctor, a lecturer at the Yale School of Public Health and a staff writer for the Atlantic. His new book, <em>Clean: The New Science of Skin</em>,&nbsp;asks readers to question the multitude&nbsp;of products they're being sold in the name of hygiene and personal care, and whether some of them may, in fact, be doing more harm than good.&nbsp;</p>  <p>He says&nbsp;a global pandemic could be&nbsp;a better time than ever to experiment with cutting back on those products — and on showering overall.&nbsp;</p>  <h2>The rapid expansion of personal hygiene products&nbsp;</h2>  <p>A hundred years ago, having running water and a bar of soap in the home was a new phenomenon, Hamblin said.</p>  <p>Nowadays, a single family's bathroom may be&nbsp;home to an&nbsp;incredible array of products — scented soaps, body washes, shampoos, conditioners, cream rinses, facial cleansers, and an assortment of creams, ointments and serums all meant for specific&nbsp;body parts.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It is a brilliant story of marketing," he said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's basically a process of segmenting and growth by the big corporations that have sold us these things and found ways to make these&nbsp;products slightly differentiated so that they are maybe a little different colour, a little different scent, a little different concentration, and making whole new products out of them."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/usa-walmart.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/usa-walmart.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-walmart.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-walmart.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/usa-walmart.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5714986.1599503853!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/usa-walmart.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Shampoos, soaps and other hygiene products on display in a Walmart aisle. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>That original shift toward personal&nbsp;hygiene was based in science, Hamblin&nbsp;said, and helped&nbsp;curb the spread of disease and infections.</p>  <p>"But it really quickly devolved away from from actual disease prevention practices and toward wealth and class signifiers."</p>  <p>That linking of cleanliness to class, Hamblin&nbsp;says, has had devastating consequences for society at large.</p>  <p>"Throughout the history of the idea of cleanliness, it has been used maliciously as being used to justify racism and xenophobia, and we've we've called other groups unclean since before we had germ theory as a way of just differentiating ourselves and justifying plunder," he said.</p>  <p>Asked what he think of&nbsp;comments by U.S. President Donald Trump about&nbsp;<a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7271702/donald-trump-shower-hair/">increasing&nbsp;water pressure from showerheads</a> to have a more intense shower experience and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177">injecting disinfectant to combat COVID-19</a>, he said that "goes hand-in-hand with a lot of germaphobia."</p>  <p>"There are clear tropes with purity and cleanliness that become very easily tied up in toxic ways, toward thinking you just want to eradicate all foreign entities," he said.</p>  <p>"That is where you start to see very clearly a propensity to just think of all germs are bad and purity as good as this hyper-simplified version of the actual way that we should be thinking about our skin and our microbial worlds."</p>  <h2>Balancing your bacteria&nbsp;</h2>  <p>Human skin is covered in bacteria. And Hamblin says that's not a bad thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"They are all over us all the time. So we are never without the skin microbiome. We wouldn't want to be.

<p>Columnar storage is a proven way to speed up database query performance by greatly reducing I/O during query execution. It’s been a fundamental feature in analytic relational databases such as Vertica, Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, and many others for more than a decade. It’s also a fundamental feature of the PostgreSQL query-acceleration extensions of <a href="https://swarm64.com/swarm64-da/">Swarm64 DA</a>.</p>



<p>In Swarm64 DA 5.0 (<a href="https://swarm64.com/early-access-request/">now in beta</a>), compressed columnar storage is implemented as a columnstore index, which can easily be applied to any standard PostgreSQL table to speed up queries. </p>



<p><a href="https://swarm64.com/early-access-request/">Try the Swarm64 DA 5.0 beta for free</a></p><p>The columnstore index caches the data of the related table in a compressed column-oriented format, thus providing data locality for similar values. A query that uses the columnstore index benefits from more efficient I/O and improved CPU utilization. Both these properties lead to faster query execution.</p>



<h3>Why columnstore indexing is important for PostgreSQL</h3>



<p>The columnstore index provides a more performant way for PostgreSQL to retrieve data from large tables in queries that use a subset of all the columns in the table.</p>



<p>Columnstore indexing can be very useful if you are doing any of these things with PostgreSQL:</p>



<ul><li>Migrating applications from Microsoft SQL Server, which also implements columnstore indexes</li><li>Supporting mixed workloads, for example user reporting on an OLTP database or accelerating the occasional table scan</li><li>Improving query and reporting performance, especially at scale, for concurrent users</li><li>Implementing data warehouses and analytical databases on free, open source PostgreSQL</li></ul>



<h3>What is columnar storage, and how does it accelerate queries?</h3>



<p>Columnar storage is an established DBMS concept, but let’s start with a high-level primer on how columnar storage accelerates querying. Consider the following table containing data about pets:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-1024x455.png" alt="How columnar storage for PostgreSQL works" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-1024x455.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-300x133.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table-768x341.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-table.png 1143w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>In row-oriented databases such as PostgreSQL, data pages (or blocks) store the values of an entire row together, sequentially for each column in the row. The rows-to-data pages ratio might be more or less than one, depending on the number and type of columns per row and the data page size setting. For illustration purposes, let’s assume that each data page in our Pets database contains one row in our table:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1024x92.png" alt="" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1024x92.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-300x27.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-768x69.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows-1536x137.png 1536w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Rows.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Row-oriented storage is optimal for OLTP performance, where transactions frequently read and write entire records. However, if you query one column of the row-store table, for example PetType, you see that all columns are read, which means the query wastes a lot of time scanning and filtering irrelevant data.</p>



<p>Column-oriented storage solves this problem by grouping values of the same column (PetType) together on disk:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1024x90.png" alt="Columnar storage in PostgreSQL example" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1024x90.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-300x26.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-768x68.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols-1536x135.png 1536w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pet-Table-Cols.png 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>For that same query on the PetType column, only the values of the relevant column are scanned, which results in fewer reads from storage and faster query results. In this simple case, each page read from storage contains PetType values for five rows instead of one, so I/O would be reduced by 5x.</p>



<h3>But wait, there’s less! (compressed columns)</h3>



<p>Since columns contain data of the same type, and especially when they contain relatively few unique values, they lend themselves well to compression. This further decreases I/O (and query time) by squeezing even more column values into each data page. In fact, compressed columns are often small enough to remain cached entirely in memory for very fast query performance.</p>



<h3>Accelerating TPC-H with PostgreSQL columnstore indexing</h3>



<p>When we run a 1-terabyte (SF1000) TPC-H benchmark on PostgreSQL with the Swarm64 DA extensions installed, you can see the effects of the columnstore indexing (along with other PostgreSQL acceleration features in Swarm64 DA, such as increased parallelism). The time required to run the whole benchmark is reduced by 19x with Swarm64 DA, with some queries executing as much as 60x faster:</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-1024x722.png" alt="PostgreSQL columnstore indexes accelerate TPC-H benchmark by 19x" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-1024x722.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-300x212.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H-768x542.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-V5-Postgres-TPC-H.png 1175w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Swarm64 DA 5.0, with Columnstore indexing helps PostgreSQL 12 run TPC-H 19x faster </figcaption></figure>



<p>The following chart shows how much columnstore indexing reduces I/O. As the I/O bars show in the chart below, with columnstore indexes applied, 17x less data is read by PostgreSQL during the benchmark. This reduces scan time by up to 20x in some TPC-H queries.</p>



<figure><img src="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-1024x618.png" alt="Columnstore indexes in PostgreSQL reduce query I/O" srcset="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-1024x618.png 1024w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-300x181.png 300w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1-768x464.png 768w, https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Swarm64-Postgres-Resource-Utilization-1.png 1287w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Columnstore indexing reduces I/O by 17x in a 1TB TPC-H benchmark</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Creating a columnstore index in PostgreSQL with Swarm64 DA</h3>



<p>As mentioned, columnstore indexes can be defined for any PostgreSQL table. Let’s suppose we have the following table definition:</p>



<pre><code>CREATE TABLE orders (
o_orderkey bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
o_custkey int NOT NULL,
o_orderstatus "char" NOT NULL,
o_totalprice double precision NOT NULL,
o_orderdate date NOT NULL,
o_orderpriority character varying(15) NOT NULL,
o_clerk character varying(15) NOT NULL,
o_shippriority int NOT NULL,
o_comment character varying(79)
);</code></pre>



<p>A columnstore index should cover your most commonly accessed columns. Let’s suppose we want a columnstore index that covers all columns in the orders table except for an infrequently referenced o_comment column. In this case, we use the following create index statement:</p>



<pre><code>CREATE INDEX orders_columnstore_idx ON orders USING columnstore(
o_orderkey
, o_custkey
, o_orderstatus
, o_totalprice
, o_orderdate
, o_orderpriority
, o_clerk
, o_shippriority
);</code></pre>



<p>The specific order of the columns in the CREATE INDEX statement does not matter. The new columnstore index will initialize as soon as you execute a VACUUM statement or whenever autovacuum next kicks in.</p>



<h3>Columnstore indexes work like most any other PostgreSQL index</h3>



<p>After the columnstore index is created, the PostgreSQL planner uses it automatically in your queries. Like other PostgreSQL indexes, the columnstore index has full transaction safety, crash-safety, replication support, and it benefits from an often-vacuumed database for optimal performance.</p>



<h3>Try it out, and let us know what you think</h3>



<p>That’s a high-level overview of columnstore indexing and columnar data storage for PostgreSQL. </p>



<p>For more detail, check out this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://swarm64.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Intro-Columnstore-Indexing-Postgres.pdf" target="_blank">slide deck on PostgreSQL columnstore indexing</a> from a <a href="https://swarm64.com/columnstore-index-webcast/">recent webcast</a> we ran.</p>



<p>In upcoming blog posts we will detail other aspects of columnstore indexing like compression and additional columnstore indexing best practices.</p>



<p>Columnstore indexing is available now in the preview release of Swarm64 DA 5.0. We’d love to hear your feedback. If you’d like to try it out for free, you can request a copy here:</p>

          <p>It’s often forgotten that graphic design revolves around communication. A visual way of communication, but communication nonetheless. There’s 4 things needed for successful communication: </p><ul><li>The Sender</li><li>The Message</li><li>The Medium </li><li>The Receiver</li></ul><p>This applies to all types of communication, verbal and non-verbal alike.</p><p>For a message to be successful (i.e. the sender is able to send out the message and have the receiver on the other end get it and decipher it), some criteria must be met:</p><ul><li><strong>A common language must be spoken.</strong> "Language” can be verbal or nonverbal. Following this logic, English is a language of course, but so are images, maths, and music! For any of these languages to be shared and understood by two or more people, organization is required. This organization ensures that the communication can be deciphered by the receiver in the way that the sender intended.</li><li><strong>The medium mustn’t have noise or noise must at least be minimal.</strong> By “noise” I mean interference - something that could alter the message or in some way prevent the message from being deciphered. An example of this is the game telephone we used to play as kids. In this game a message is whispered from one kid to another and, without a doubt, by the time it gets to the last person it will have been changed from the original message. Another more straightforward example is trying to talk to someone across a noisy and crowded room: the message will most likely arrive deformed (or not at all).</li></ul><p>It’s interesting to think about the different ways in which communication can be established. Imagine none of us spoke the same spoken language: we would need another type of language in order to establish communication. This is one of the areas where graphic design is applied. The study really should be called “graphic <em>communication</em>”, but it’s shinier to say “design” so that stuck. </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, images are a form of communication in themselves. There’s certain conventions that need to be established for them to be used as a language. For example, if I drew a stick figure, then there is a great chance that everyone will know that it’s a loose interpretation of a person. How do we know this? By convention.</p><p>We unconsciously learn a lot of things by convention just by being immersed in the society that we live in. Graphic design exploits those conventions in order to create communication. It’s why it’s so important to never re-invent the wheel. Not only is it a waste of time, but it would also go against convention, creating interference in the medium, and prohibiting the receiver from deciphering the message.</p><p>On the other hand though, imagery can be a tricky way of communicating. Images are associated to symbols and concepts rather than a concrete “thing”. For example the stick figure I drew means “person” to me, but, to someone who doesn’t share any of the same social and cultural conventions as me, it might not. Sometimes even images literally don’t translate.</p><p>Today I wanted to talk about a piece of graphic design which to me is the epitome of AWESOME in both communication and aesthetics. It’s a piece that was created to send a message to beings with whom we don’t know anything about. Scratch that, we don’t even know if they’re there. To me, this piece fully encompasses what graphic design is. Not only that but it accomplishes this in the sphere of one of my other passions, space!</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qCUtBHhJCNJc3PslYbqkQ1Z4SZNkoomxSEYAV534bgQhNNCWrnPFrOKptsiO21TxsVq5kh_t5oW7KPUJrd_cdXjwYV4p7PkmBEOQwMLihziGYa1nD3HBnDcU8etp49rBGQU2YD0b" alt="Aliens"></figure><p>In 1972 and 1973 NASA sent off the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecrafts to explore Jupiter and Saturn. After their core objectives were completed, they continued their route and flew out of the Solar System. Attached to the spacecrafts they added a golden plaque with a message. There’s over 7000 spoken languages on Earth (and a few more of unspoken nature), so how on earth (ha!) would we be able to send out a message that could be deciphered by beings that we can only assume do not share any of our Earthly conventions?</p><p>The answer is <em>science.</em></p><p>Science uses the language of mathematics to express itself. One can only assume that any civilization advanced enough to explore the universe and bump into the spacecrafts that NASA launched in the 70’s will know a thing or two about science and maths.</p><p>The Pioneer plaque was a last minute addition by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake. It’s also an important piece to me because the person who actually drew it was a woman: Linda Salzman Sagan, Dr Sagan’s wife.</p><p>The plaque is broken down into 4 sections and can be “read” using maths.</p><h3 id="section-1-the-key">Section 1: The Key</h3><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JT_zuZTxrPj7sCsaTEUSZ--bdeGrTnJcBOWtQIz1pB0rMOm9BdXMaBLnCDAuNQDagi3lZNXhUAdJ7fMj54WWTcYYRG95-DR48SJIml2uNvXuhpZPNiLedPENnJ3JUd-Q954ff1qC"></figure><p>The first section shows two hydrogen atoms and represents the key to deciphering the whole plaque. The design team and the scientists postulated that hydrogen, being the most abundant element in the cosmos, would be one of the first elements to be discovered and studied by a civilization. The hydrogen atoms are shown changing from one energy state to another, a process called hyperfine transition where electromagnetic radiation is released. That wavelength can be traced (it’s approximately 21cm), serving as the first clue by giving a spatial measurement. The period of the transition can also be calculated to approximately .7 nanoseconds, serving as the second unit given, a unit of time. The next clue is the small tick between the atoms, that assigns the values of space and time to the binary number 1.</p><h3 id="section-2-the-address">Section 2: The Address</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cbTM1HQp21jmqc6fJYW2NCzn9yVxzv4ik7yboPq58gEBtnSxQUv2ZGeiDwvQdPrVkpriMQo-L3SrNR_rKriBv45kBNuef_gS_MNfXdwQUMHpvKCn_Ev6Kas69-orNVNBhSkC6j2I"></figure><p>The second part of the plaque is a bundle of lines extending radially from a common centre: our star, the Sun. This is our interstellar address. The lines indicate the direction of the 14 most significant pulsars (a type of rotating star) near our Solar System. The little dashes and lines represent the period of the respective pulsar, in binary. Not only is this a map communicating the position from which the message originated, but time as well. With this information, a civilization advanced enough to decipher this part of the message could triangulate our position in time and space.</p><h3 id="section-3-the-origin">Section 3: The Origin</h3><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5IZgnT-GDfSgI4-BkSrHM-ay1SK8E1sCr6SYftns-hd9k-YtCZZvJHT4LL-6rh9bY_B6om85iB0g2aZbg8iafNtUsyiqmb_jhqiNUk6W_491zSOFn_a0B-lf9rdlpzMW84Q3yDK0"></figure><p>The next section of the message is a zoomed out view of our Solar System, with the Sun at the far left, followed by the 9 planets (Pluto was still considered a planet when the spacecrafts were launched) orbiting the star. Their respective distances to the Sun are written in binary above or below each planet. The third planet, the Earth, shows the path the spacecraft took when launched, which gives evidence of the origin of the Pioneer spacecrafts.</p><h3 id="section-4-the-sender">Section 4: The Sender</h3><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/c9RbDfaTK-tI1dcKMorsan91YbVYFuKNd3kbuRPodlJYZkm8SYwVjZAOI966mmGEKf1paQQGWZ-tEckwmCO-mo7xrZ-57v-CJM5zYZAxsTLD_BMFi5ajwlCJqtAnfkiTBloS0Yt_"></figure><p>The final section shows what’s found in that planet. The image of a man and a woman, the man bends his arm and extends his open palm as a sign of 'hello', which admittedly could be meaningless to another civilization. No detail in this plaque has been by chance, as seen in the woman’s stance, her arms are down and her weight is shifted to one side to show we are mobile and flexible. They stand by a diagram of the probe for scale, but if that wasn’t enough, on the far right of the image there is a binary number 8, meaning the woman is 8 units tall (or, 8 x 21cm = 5.5 feet tall).</p><p>The last signal from Pioneer 10 was received in 2003, when it was 12 billion kilometers from Earth.</p><p>I love this piece not only because it combines two of my greatest passions, but also because it’s one of the most ambitious pieces of communication ever created. The receiver is unknown, the common language is a big assumption, and we’ll probably never know for certain whether the message was deciphered like the sender intended. </p><p>Having said that, it may sound like this was a fruitless exercise by the very smart folks at NASA. From a graphic design point of view however, it’s incredibly poignant how communication can be established (or, at the very least, initiated) by learning as much possible about those who will be deciphering the message. In this case, the assumption that a learned civilization would know of the hydrogen atom allowed experts to work backwards from that point and attempt to establish a common language (science) so that whoever might be out there could understand our message: "We're here!"</p><hr><p>If you liked this article by our Chief Design Officer, Vicky, <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/cdo-victoria-jaime/">check out this interview with her!</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>In 2002, my mom started a new job in finance. One day, I visited her office. As part of the grand tour, she showed me her Lotus Notes setup on her PC, and explained that she received around 400 emails a day. This <em>baffled</em> my eleven year old mind: “why don’t you guys just use MSN?” My friends at school used Microsoft’s Messenger for everything. Some of my friends in the US had me hopping on AOL, but either one seemed obviously better than my mom and her highly-paid colleagues shooting one-line emails through their bulky setups. Nearly twenty years later, Slack and Microsoft Teams are finally making real-time chat commonplace even among the most traditional enterprises.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, I was deep in MMO gaming (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape">RuneScape</a>). I joined and led clans of hundreds of other players, sometimes in PVP, but most often just to make money. For us kids, these were remarkably successful group efforts: large groups of teenage strangers around the world organized themselves, mostly over text chat, to work together for hours every day. I still know my major timezone overlaps off by heart from back then. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhpBB">phpBB forums</a> for longer-form discussion and official matters, and set up internal Wikis for knowledge management. We used IRC to chat in real-time, and set up dozens of custom scripts to integrate with external services. If we needed audio to chat in real-time, we’d use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventrilo">Ventrilo</a>, which would support up to 400 people simultaneously. For sharing short screen recordings, we used <a href="https://gyazo.com/">Gyazo</a> and <a href="https://puush.me/">Puush</a>, a decade before <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a> was founded.</p> <p>As such, the past few months of COVID quarantine have been a real throwback for me. As a teen, I sat at my desk for fourteen hours a day, coordinating buyouts of ingame items, playing on one screen, watching IRC and forums on the other, while chatting over Ventrilo.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">1</a></sup> Now, as an adult, I am doing the same, just with real work, Slack, and Zoom instead.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p> <p>The rest of the world has been adjusting to this new normal, and venture/tech Twitter (mostly people who were <em>not</em> obsessive online-gaming teens in the early 2000s) has been abuzz with theories about what collaboration in this new world looks like. To me, it looks a great deal like the toolset I used to very competitively<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> play online games. Some tools, like Notion, GitHub, and Roam Research are genuinely unprecedented in that they have no prior product analogies, but for the most part, you can predict the 2020 remote work toolkit by looking at the 2010 gaming toolkit.</p> <p>It’s unsurprising that there would be a strong correspondence between online gaming and work tools. Both are collaborative team efforts, and require low-latency communication over text, audio, and video. Both make use of complex external services to manage recruiting, onboarding, collective knowledge, and to solve complicated coordination problems over multiple timezones for dozens, if not hundreds of teammates.</p> <p>Let’s look ahead. What does gaming in 2020 tell us about collaborative work in the future?</p> <h3 id="twitch">Twitch</h3> <p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> is a livestreaming/social platform, most popular for video games. Streamers on Twitch have slowly expanded to now include real-life vlogging, teaching, live coding, painting, writing, and other non-gaming genres. What’s most interesting is that streamers are starting to use Twitch to share their <em>creative efforts</em> as they build: some people are now even <a href="https://24hrstartup.com/">building businesses</a>, all in public, on Twitch.</p> <p>I believe this style of content production and engagement is going to shift <em>how work is done</em> in a few years. Most employees will be streaming as they work, and their colleagues may drop in on their streams with ideas and suggestions. It’ll feel weirdly invasive at first. There’s certainly a hump to get over when live-streaming your thoughts and showing your intimate, unfinished work-product drafts. However, once people get used to it, it’s collaboration supercharged. You’ll work, take a break, peruse your coworkers’ streams, find something interesting, drop in, chat for five minutes, share context, and get back to your own stuff. The feedback loop of creation becomes much tighter.</p> <h3 id="video-as-institutional-knowledge">Video as Institutional Knowledge</h3> <p>Closely related to Twitch is YouTube – after you’ve done a stream, you’ll upload a copy for posterity. This solves a problem in how companies deal with the loss of institutional knowledge – namely, <em>how to do stuff</em> – as they grow. As people leave, so do all the little procedures and processes that glue together a large operational organization. All companies try to remedy this through written knowledge bases, and the vast majority fail. Screen recordings of <em>how employees work</em> can be powerful stores of institutional knowledge.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">4</a></sup></p> <h3 id="audio-preferred">Audio Preferred</h3> <p>Face-to-face communications for routine meetings are going away. I’m in a lot of Zoom meetings these days, and I don’t want to stare at another person’s face, and try to read their expressions. It wears me out. I don’t want to carefully adjust my background to look presentable. Most people I know who are on 3+ calls a day will subtly push toward audio-only. New users may start off excited about video meetings and seeing other people’s faces, but as they become power users, video becomes too taxing and they move toward audio only. Outside of important/first-time external meetings, power users and well-acquainted teammates don’t want all the baggage of video calls, they want <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeamSpeak">TeamSpeak</a>.</p> <h3 id="splinter-groups">Splinter Groups</h3> <p>As far as meetings go, the current big open problem is that it is extremely difficult to replicate the experience of meeting as a group, splintering into smaller conversations, and hopping from conversation to conversation, the way you might at a professional event (or a party in Silicon Valley; the two are identical). Ventrilo solved this problem over a decade ago:<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">5</a></sup> create ephemeral channels/groups within your VoIP server that people can join, and that close when they have no members. Supporting this is the next big step for Zoom. If they fall short, they very seriously open up the market for any other entrant that can facilitate this.</p> <h3 id="arvr">AR/VR</h3> <p>For all the talk about shifting paradigms under remote work, there’s been little talk of AR/VR collaborative solutions. There are tons of vendors! But they’re all uncanny-valley experiences that very imperfectly try to replicate the experience of face-to-face meetings, or (even worse) conferences. All of these collaborate-in-VR solutions feel awkwardly skeuomorphic, and I expect that nothing will come of them.</p> <p>Why? Because, just like in the above point, face-to-face comms are an <em>artifact</em>, not a <em>goal</em>. The goals are always to exchange information, build trust, and to make decisions. Strapping into an Oculus Rift to sit in a virtual meeting room with a bunch of Lara Croft lookalikes doesn’t advance the goal, it only distracts. Even a perfect VR experience would only distract.</p> <p>Going out on a limb, I expect that if users do end up going for 3D interaction, it’s going to look a lot more like a blend of traditional MMORPGs and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-started-hubs-mozilla">Mozilla Hubs</a> than anything requiring an AR or VR device.</p> <h3 id="discord">Discord</h3> <p>If Discord starts marketing itself for a more professional crowd, it will destroy Slack. It’s a far superior software product – lighter-weight, faster, and it natively supports audio and video chat inside the platform. Discord is a $10B+ company in the making. Perhaps controversially, I think if users adapt to audio being more important than video, Discord is a serious competitor to Zoom.</p> <h3 id="lighter-weight-applications">Lighter-Weight Applications</h3> <p>All good gaming-adjacent software is light and fast. Bulky software would slow down your computer and you’d lose in games! Similarly, we’re enduring an epidemic of slow enterprise software. Asana, JIRA, Confluence, Slack, Google Drive, and so forth: using any of these tools is like wading through molasses. There’s lag when you enter keystrokes, interfaces load slowly due to hundreds of API calls under the hood, and so on.</p> <p>I desperately hope that as SaaS providers try harder to provide mind-melding interfaces between man and machine, they’ll eventually realize that a lack of speed is the biggest barrier between the two; that the speed of response and navigation is the single most important feature to a serious user.</p> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>Right now, we are in a strange period of adjustment as people learn to work remotely. Users cling to representations of real life, meetings, and face-to-face Zooms. But this is an inconvenience, and it’ll become more rare for routine work. Audio is king in the remote world work; video – of actual humans – is less relevant, simulacrum of a past paradigm. On the other hand, video of <em>work</em> is of paramount importance, and the combination of live streaming and video storage will reshape how employees work, collaborate, and share institutional knowledge.</p> <p>In this world, AR and VR are somewhat counter-intuitive losers, only useful in very niche applications. If people collaborate in some kinds of 3D spaces, it’ll be mostly for rapid prototyping, sketching, etc. It is clear that collaborative, multi-user, version-controlled/historied software will succeed in this paradigm; I expect more products like Figma and Google Docs to arrive, and single-user software like PhotoShop to quietly leave the scene. And I pray that this new, glorious software will be fast.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="container">
  <article id="nia7itjJEGxkpP9jfNvDPH">
	<time datetime="2020-09-07">September  7, 2020</time>
  
	<p>With U.S. stocks <a href="https://linkbefore.pub/">hitting all-time highs</a>, and tech stocks <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/us-tech-stocks-are-now-worth-more-than-the-entire-european-stock-market.html">being worth more than the entire European stock market</a> combined; you might be wondering if we are in a bubble. It’s a serious question especially if you are looking to get in or out of the market in these times.</p>

<p>On a linear scale, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ_Composite">Nasdaq Composite</a> looks like this.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/h3MBaJ9YNS81ukfc4BZSTi0xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/h3MBaJ9YNS81ukfc4BZSTi0xspap.png" alt="Nasdaq index"></a></p>

<p>Although the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average">Dow Jones</a> is looking more conservative, skeptics would argue that the market should go down. After all, we are about to enter one of the worst economic crisis due to the Coronarvirus; and unemployment numbers are just terrifying. But the stock market doesn’t seem to think so.</p>

<p>Which begs the question: <em>Are we in a bubble?</em></p>

<p>To argue whether the market is overpriced, we need to figure out how to price stocks. If we know how much a particular company is worth, we should  be able to reason about its stock price. Stocks, like many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset">assets</a>, pay a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend">dividend</a>. A stock, in an efficient market, is worth its future dividends combined.</p>

<p>With this simplification, we can calculate a fair price for the company <code>FANG</code> assuming we know how much it is going to pay in dividends in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>FANG</code> fair price = dividend 2020 + dividend 2021 + … + dividend 2065</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our model calculates the fair price of <code>FANG</code>. If <code>FANG</code> is trading below our model price, we buy. If <code>FANG</code> is trading above our model price, we sell. This is a very straightforward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage">arbitrage</a>; if you are able to accurately predict how much the company will pay in dividends. For the purpose of this article, we’ll assume that is true for our imaginary company <code>FANG</code>.</p>

<p>With such a solid framework to price stocks, we can now make a lot of money. Comes the first complication: Inflation. It’s easy to be mislead that our strategies are making a profit, when in reality it’s inflation that is driving them. Again, to simplify, we are going to assume that we can accurately predict the inflation rate.</p>

<p>With that, let’s look at our first scenario: The yearly inflation rate is 10%. Our research office had predicted that the company <code>FANG</code> is going to pay $10 in dividends by the end of the year and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_(law)">dissolve</a> with no assets left.</p>

<p>According to our model, the company should trade at the sum of its future dividends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>FANG</code> fair price = 2021 dividends = $10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with inflation, $10 today is worth less than the same $10 in the future. We know that <code>FANG</code> is going to pay $10 in the future regardless of the inflation rate. We need to adjust our price to account for inflation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>FANG</code> fair price (adjusted for inflation) = $9.09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the end of the year, <code>FANG</code> should be trading at $10; but that <strong>future</strong> $10 has as much purchasing power as <strong>today’s</strong> $9.09. This adjustment ensures that we do not lose money due to inflation. <em>If we predict high inflation in the future, we should price this particular stock down, not up</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next scenario has a twist: An imaginary company <code>AAPL</code> produces apples and pays dividends in real apples instead of dollars. Today, an apple cost $1; and with inflation an apple will cost $1.1 by the end of the year. The company <code>AAPL</code> is going to pay 10 apples in dividends by year-end, and also dissolve. What’s the fair price for <code>AAPL</code>?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it’s $10. Think about it this way: <code>AAPL</code> is going to pay 10 apples in dividends worth $10 <strong>today</strong>. That is how much <code>AAPL</code> is worth <strong>today</strong>. By the end of the year, the apples are worth $11 and <code>AAPL</code> should trade at $11.</p>

<p>This particular stock can protect you against inflation, but only if you buy at reasonable (non-inflated) prices. This means, for this particular stock, inflation has no effects on the price. It doesn’t matter how much apples are going to be worth in the future, you are pricing the stock today.</p>

<p><strong>What about deflation?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation">Deflation</a> is the reverse of inflation. For stocks that generate dollars, deflation should price them up. For stocks that generate apples-like goods, it doesn’t matter; as with inflation.</p>

<p>Let’s forget about inflation and deflation. In this part, we’ll assume that dollars hold stable values, regardless. Our investor has $10 and is looking to put his money to work; he also has no viable use of his money. Unluckily, there is a single company to invest in; <code>FANG</code>. The company will pay $10 in dividend guaranteed by the end of the year and then dissolve.</p>

<p>Comes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve">Fed</a>: The Federal Reserve has announced that it is guaranteeing all of the government issued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond">bonds</a>. This means that these bonds are risk-free since the Fed can <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federally-guaranteed-obligation.asp">print its way out of a loan</a>. These bonds pay 10% yearly and our investor can buy them.</p>

<p>Our investor looks at his trading terminal: He can buy the bonds at $10; and get $11 by the end of the year. Or he can buy <code>FANG</code> and gets $10 by the end of the year. With this new choice (government bond), our investor is unlikely to buy <code>FANG</code> at $10/share. It makes more sense to buy the government bond as it has better <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(finance)">yield</a>.</p>

<p>For <code>FANG</code> to make sense, it has to pay (yield) at least as well as the government bond. For that, <strong>today</strong>, <code>FANG</code> should trade at $9.09 to be of good value for our investor. The market is now at equilibrium: both viable investments now generate an equal yield: 10%.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The trade of the century</strong></p>

<p>With government intervention (which is acting similar to inflation; if you noticed), our investor should be careful about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_(finance)">coupon</a> for these bonds. In the future, these are going to determine how he prices stocks. And how much can this interest rate affect the market? <em>Hold your horses</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s analyze this scenario where we have these two companies: <code>FAST</code> and <code>SLOW</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ticker</strong>: <code>FAST</code><br>
Company will pay $10 guaranteed by the end of the year and then dissolve.<br>
<strong>Ticker</strong>: <code>SLOW</code><br>
Company will pay $10 guaranteed after 100 years and then dissolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might seem counter-intuitive but with <em>no inflation and no government bonds</em>, both of these investments are equivalent for an investor with a 100 year investment horizon. This assumes that our investor has no other viable use of his money. On a <em>rational</em> market, under these conditions, both should trade at the same price: $10. After all, if there are no other viable investment, the investor who put his money in <code>FAST</code> is going to hold cash for the next 99 years; ending with a similar yield to <code>SLOW</code>.</p>

<p>So what happens if the government introduces a 100 year bond with a 10% interest rate payout? Let’s do the math.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ticker</strong>: <code>FAST</code><br>
Government yield: %10<br>
Fair price: $9.09<br>
<strong>Ticker</strong>: <code>SLOW</code><br>
Government yield: %1,378,061<br>
Fair price: $0.000725</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the government bond did affect the <code>FAST</code> company slightly, the price for <code>SLOW</code> practically evaporated. Both companies are still the same companies and are going to deliver on their promises. Nothing has changed and yet the prices made it seem like the apocalypse is upon us.</p>

<p>If we start from a situation where government is paying interest and  then decides to do it no more; prices are going to go up. This uplift is going to be much more noticeable for stocks with a very far-off payout. A smart or well-connected investor will buy these stocks and then watch his portfolio skyrocket.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/knnrY2r4JLNpMeSYrhFW7j0xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/knnrY2r4JLNpMeSYrhFW7j0xspap_small.png" alt="rates.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligent_Investor">The intelligent investor</a> is a recommended reading for people looking to generate yield. It establishes a framework for investing that we summarized above: If bonds have better yield, then buy bonds and sell stocks; and vice-versa. However, low interest rates might stick for a while: Japan has been on this regime for over 20 years and it’s unlikely to change in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/5rWFJWaQdEi5FtKxBfXLo90xspap.png"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/5rWFJWaQdEi5FtKxBfXLo90xspap_small.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-09-08 at 4.22.47 PM.png"></a></p>

<p>If you are <em>an intelligent investor</em>, you might think that investors buying or holding assets in these times are crazy. Actually, they could be the most careful. For an investor with a long-time investment horizon, has no viable use of his money and is expecting a regime change to zero or negative interest rate; the best trade is to either buy or hold your assets.</p>

<p>In a negative rate world, it’s safe to throw <em>The intelligent investor</em> book. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price%E2%80%93earnings_ratio">P/E ratios</a> make more sense in a high interest rate world since companies are competing with the risk-free rate. If bonds are generating an income, you want your stocks to generate a comparable dividend. This is the effect that prices far-payoff stocks down.</p>

<p>If Tech companies are perceived to have a very far pay-off, then they become the most affected by a zero or negative interest rate. In that sense, investors are not buying up these stocks; they are just pricing them to the new reality. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory">Modern Money Theory</a> on the rise, it’s possible that negative rates become the norm; especially that MMT response to inflation is to raise taxes not the interest rate.</p>

<p>MMT is the idea that money should be available to anyone who <em>deserves</em> it (ie: If you want to make a transaction, you should have liquidity available). You can think of interest rates as a rent payment to people who own the cash. It’s not fair to not be able to conduct business without going through a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier">rentier</a>. On the other hand, today’s retirees have benefited from this high-yield to generate massive wealth in the last century by the power of compound interest. This makes them the suitable suitors to buy today’s assets which will become inaccessible for most of the workforce once prices adjust.</p>

<p>The upside of MMT and 0% interest rates is that it allows a whole set of businesses to become viable. Businesses with a 1% yield are not viable with a high interest rate as it makes more sense to just buy bonds. People who can generate yield will thrive, since the expected market yield is zero. It’s still a question whether this will benefit mainstream; or a bunch of tech companies that have a monopoly of tech and innovation. In this kinda world,  tech and innovation are the only possible venues to generate yield, since money is widely available for anything else.</p>

<p>It’s possible that MMT becomes the very worst enemy it’s trying to protect us from; creating a situation where wealth mobility is practically impossible. After all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>

<p>Maybe, but it’s also possible that these high prices are here to stay. Since the Euro zone is also …</p></article></section></div>

            <!-- content --><p>Today we are going to discuss a change to server security that is going to make waves in the home lab and secondary markets for servers and components in the future. During our recent <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 review</a> we briefly mentioned that AMD EPYC CPUs in the system are vendor locked to Dell EMC systems. This is not a Dell-specific concern. We have confirmed that other vendors are supporting the feature behind this. For the large vendors, their platform security teams are pushing to build more secure platforms for their customers, and that is going to have future impacts on the secondary server market and home labs.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to cover the basics of what is happening. We are going to discuss the motivations, and why this is going to be more common in the future. Finally, we are going to discuss what those in the industry can do to keep the secondary server market operating well. If you work with partners or resellers who dip into used parts bins or even have the potential to purchase grey market CPUs, send them this article or accompanying video. The current market has a large disconnect between what some large customers are asking for, and large vendors are delivering on and what others in the market know is happening.<span id="more-46716"></span></p>
<h2>Accompanying Video</h2>
<p>This is an important topic. To ensure that we can cover those who like to read/ skim and those who like to get information via audio, we have an accompanying video:</p>
<p><iframe title="Vendor Locking AMD EPYC CPUs Great for Security at a Cost" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNVuTAVYxpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Feel free to pop open that video on YouTube and check it out or to send to those who prefer not to read.</p>
<h2>Background: How we learned this was a “thing”</h2>
<p>In 2018 we did a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-r7415-review/">Dell EMC PowerEdge R7415 review</a> and as part of that review, we started our normal process of trying different CPUs in the system. Early in that process, we used an AMD EPYC 7251 CPU, the low-end 8-core model, and noticed something curious. It would not work in our other test systems after.</p>
<p>After a bit of research, we found it was because Dell EMC was vendor locking the chips to Dell systems. We did not know exactly why, but we were told was a security feature. At this point, and even to this day two years later, not every vendor takes advantage of all of the AMD EPYC security features. What that practically means is that what we saw with the Dell EMC system is not what we saw with other systems. For example, we were able to interchangeably use CPUs in Supermicro and Tyan systems, but we could not use those systems once they went into a Dell EMC server.</p>

<p>We found we were not alone. Laboratories, VARs, and other organizations were finding that transferring AMD EPYC CPUs from one vendor’s system to another, was not the simple process it was on the Intel Xeon side. It did not always work.</p>
<p>We knew it was a security feature and thought that most who are buying servers would be informed of this by their sales reps or channel partners. After I personally got a lot of texts, e-mails, instant messaging, and comments on our C6525 video and article, I realized that this actually may be a situation where many people do not know what is going on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46531"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-review-2u4n-amd-epyc-kilo-thread-server/dell-emc-poweredge-c6525-internal-view-nodes-partially-out/" rel="attachment wp-att-46531"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out.jpg" alt="Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 Internal View Nodes Partially Out" width="800" height="519" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out-400x260.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out-696x452.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dell-EMC-PowerEdge-C6525-Internal-View-Nodes-Partially-Out-647x420.jpg 647w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46531">Dell EMC PowerEdge C6525 Internal View Nodes Partially Out</figcaption></figure>
<p>This experience that we had, apparently is one that is not overly common yet. That makes sense because the systems that utilize the enhanced security levels are still largely new, and being used by their first buyers. Also, AMD still has a smaller market share than Intel. A big reason, by the way, that Intel Xeon does not have this issue is that they do not have the security feature that AMD has. Vendors like HPE, Dell, and Lenovo have come out and stated that their AMD EPYC systems are more secure than their Intel Xeon systems, and this behavior is a byproduct of that enhanced security.</p>
<p>Next, we are going to dive into the feature of AMD processors (and what will be more common in future CPUs from other vendors.)</p>
<h2>AMD EPYC Secure Processor Platform Secure Boot (PSB)</h2>
<p>Let us start with the high-level slide. This is effectively the same slide on the AMD Secure Processor that we saw with the AMD EPYC 7001 series launch, but this is from the EPYC 7002 series. AMD EPYC CPUs may be x86, but they have an embedded Arm Cortex-A5 microcontroller that runs its own OS that is independent of the main system. This AMD Secure Processor is the backbone of AMD’s security push as it provides features such as key management and hardware root of trust for the platform.</p>
<figure id="attachment_36705" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36705"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/amd-epyc-7002-platform-secure-processor/" rel="attachment wp-att-36705"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg" alt="AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor" width="1792" height="918" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor.jpg 1792w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-400x205.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-800x410.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-696x357.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-1068x547.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/AMD-EPYC-7002-Platform-Secure-Processor-820x420.jpg 820w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-36705">AMD EPYC 7002 Platform Secure Processor</figcaption></figure>
<p>AMD spends time <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amd-confirms-cts-labs-exploits-requiring-admin-access/">patching this solution</a>&nbsp;to make it more secure, but it is generally fairly hard to reach without some extremely low-level access in a system. We are going to come back to the “Enables hardware validated boot” line shortly, but it is important to understand that this secure processor underpins many of AMD’s best security features.</p>
<p>For example, at STH we use EPYC’s Secure Memory Encryption and Secure Encrypted Virtualization heavily. With AMD EPYC, we do not have to manually manage keys. Instead, the ephemeral keys are managed for us by the AMD Secure Processor. This is the basis for what is really the building wave of confidential computing offerings such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-cloud-confidential-computing-enabled-by-amd-epyc-sev/">Google Cloud Confidential Computing Enabled by AMD EPYC SEV</a>. Intel has its secure boot features and SGX that will be enhanced greatly with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/the-2021-intel-ice-pickle-how-2021-will-be-crunch-time/">Ice Lake Xeons</a>, but for now, AMD has this capability while Intel does not. When big vendors say AMD is more secure, the AMD Secure Processor is a cornerstone of those offerings.</p>

<p>Let us discuss that “Enables hardware validated boot” line. While traditionally CPUs just fire up in whatever platform they are in, AMD has intelligence in their CPU due to the Arm-based AMD Secure Processor. EPYC CPUs are designed to be a bit more intelligent about the platforms they are in, and interact with server platform security to act as this root of trust that would not be possible if they effectively just booted up in any system.</p>
<p>Here is a statement from AMD describing the AMD Platform Secure Boot.</p>
<p><em>The AMD Platform Secure Boot Feature (PSB) is a mitigation for firmware Advanced Persistent Threats. It is a defense-in-depth feature. PSB extends AMD’s silicon root of trust to protect the OEM’s BIOS.&nbsp; This allows the OEM to establish an unbroken chain of trust from AMD’s silicon root of trust to the OEM’s BIOS using PSB, and then from the OEM’s BIOS to the OS Bootloader using UEFI secure boot. This provides a very powerful defense against remote attackers seeking to embed malware into a platform’s firmware.</em></p>
<p><em>An OEM who trusts only their own cryptographically signed BIOS code to run on their platforms will use a PSB enabled motherboard and set one-time-programmable fuses in the processor to bind the processor to the OEM’s firmware code signing key. AMD processors are shipped unlocked from the factory, and can initially be used with any OEM’s motherboard. But once they are used with a motherboard with PSB enabled, the security fuses will be set, and from that point on, that processor can only be used with motherboards that use the same code signing key. (<strong>Source</strong>: AMD statement to STH)</em></p>
<p>That is a lot to take in. We asked HPE about this. Their response mirrored what the above was describing. HPE firmware, when a system is first turned on, performs this binding process where the AMD EPYC CPU expects to see HPE signed firmware. If you alter the HPE firmware on the system, the check fails and the system will not work. That means if your HPE motherboard fails, you can replace it and put your CPU in another HPE motherboard with signed HPE firmware. It also means if the server platform’s firmware is not signed by HPE, the processor will see it as evidence of tampering and not work.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: 2020-09-09</strong> – HPE clarified that they are doing this in a different manner than Dell after initially confirming that they were using the AMD PSB feature. After this went live, HPE sent us the following:</p>
<p><em>HPE does not use the same security technique that Dell is using for a BIOS hardware root of trust. HPE does not burn, fuse, or permanently store our public key into AMD processors which ship with our products. HPE uses a unique approach to authenticate our BIOS and BMC firmware: HPE fuses our hardware – or silicon – root of trust into our own BMC silicon to ensure only authenticated firmware is executed.&nbsp; Thus, while we implement a hardware root of trust for our BIOS and BMC firmware, the processors that ship with our servers are not locked to our platforms. (<strong>Source</strong>: HPE)</em></p>
<p>What is at least interesting there is that HPE was initially claiming feature parity with Dell to us, and from the comments on this article were saying they used this feature in sales pitches, but now are saying they are not blowing the eFuses.</p>

<p>Here is where the concern develops, and not necessarily for AMD, the OEM, or most of the initial customer base. Customers want more security. The OEMs want to create a secure hardware environment because that is what their customers want. AMD is implementing an advanced security solution beyond what Intel Xeons have giving the OEMs and end-customers what they want. Effectively, when these are sold as new systems, this is exactly what everyone involved wants.</p>
<p>If everyone is getting what they want, then where is the concern, that is what we are going to cover next.</p>

<p>I have been writing code in multiple languages since 1994 and for almost a decade now I have been active within the open source community, primarily in R but I’ve also published some <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/settings/gforge/packages">JavaSript/TypeScript packages</a>. Publishing something that other people enjoy is a pure joy and the fact that some of my packages have download counts in the thousands is something that truly warms my heart. </p>
<p>Throughout the years I have though noticed that there is newcomers to the open source community often struggle with how to get help, which is why I decided to write this post. I’ll start out with some basics and then a little more advanced topics such as how to write an issue or a pull request.<span id="more-2210"></span></p>


<p>This happens to us all and the steps for solving your issue follow a simple path:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google the problem:
<ul>
<li>Find key words that are unique to your issue</li>
<li>Copy-paste error codes/messages into the search field (if you get to few hits, remove sections of the error code, especially anything that is specific to your setting, e.g. filename in the message)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure you understand what is happening, the easiest way is usually to print variables and inspect their content (this is usually frowned upon, but we humans are lazy by nature). A slightly more advanced approach is to use a debugger, in R there I often use <code>debug()</code> or <code>browser()</code>, you can read more about it <a href="https://rstats.wtf/debugging-r-code.html">here</a> (JavaScript the <code>debugger</code> can be quite useful).</li>
<li>Ok, so none of those worked then we read the manual or if you are in R, start looking if there is a <i>vignette</i> that covers what you are trying to do. Usually we did look at the manual in the beginning but most likely we skimmed it quickly, jumped to conclusions and started writing code. Quite often the information is there in the manual but perhaps less accessible, writing a good manual is difficult and as a package maintainer I always welcome ideas for making my manuals more accessible.</li>
<li>Now is the time to start looking for human help, ideally you start with writing up a question on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> (see section below)</li>
<li>Get a <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account and write an issue (see section below)</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually before I start engaging other people I try to have a look at the source code and see if I can understand it myself. This is often useful as I sometimes pick up neat tricks while solving the original problem, although it requires some skill and is perhaps not something that you should do as a beginner.</p>

<p>Understanding who is behind the open source community is key if you want to get help. First and foremost most of us are doing this for fun in our spare time and we don’t get paid. Some examples that I recently encountered that suggest that this isn’t obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>I recently helped out with a JavaSript package, graphql-passport. In a follow-up <a href="https://github.com/jkettmann/graphql-passport/issues/34">issue</a> there was a related bug that I was asked to help out with and wrote that <i>I’ll try to have a look at this</i> which someone downvoted without even taking the time to comment.</li>
<li>In an email from a researcher I got a question regarding my <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forestplot/index.html">forestplot</a> package. I recommended they post on Stack Overflow first so that others could find the solution, and got this back <i>“It’s 6 hours I posted my problem in StackOverflow, and I have not got any response yet. It’s very urgent for me to get the solution.”</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly none of these bothered to understand that I’m primarily an <i>orthopedic surgeon</i> and that I offer my code so that others may use it, enjoy it and hopefully get something useful out of it. If you are in a hurry, then you can always find people that know how to code that you can pay to help you out.</p>

<p>Writing a question should take time. A good question will give you an answer within minutes while a poor will perhaps never be answered. I have usually had success with the following structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the title as precise as you can</li>
<li>Start with the question, possibly with an intro, e.g. <em>“I’m trying to do a forestplot with multiple bands per row, how should I structure my input data?”</em></li>
<li>Short background on language, packages you’re using and other relevant details.</li>
<li>Add a <strong>reproducible code example</strong> – this is probably one of the most time consuming details but it is vital as the answer can build upon this code and make sure that the answer is the one that you are looking for</li>
<li>Add a longer background if needed with more details – don’t be shy to use headlines that separate sections. It is sometimes difficult to understand what detail you have missed and here you can add all those things that could possibly be contributing to your problem. At this time the reader will be familiar with the problem and can easily skip anything that he/she deems irrelevant (don’t make this too large though as a huge question may be intimidating).</li>
<li>Repeat your question, at the end you can feel free to repeat your question, possibly with some more details.</li>
<li>Choose the relevant tags, e.g. R, forestplot if you have an R question about forest plots.</li>
</ol>
<p>While writing your question, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> suggests similar questions, it has happened to me some times that I write a question and the find that I missed it during the “Googling step”. Similarly, when I’ve been writing my <i>reproducible code example</i> I figured out the solution on my own as I have removed all the noise and made everything much clearer. Sometimes it can bee good idea to then answer your own question, you won’t get points for this but it is an easy way to become an open source contributor as others will find your answer and hopefully save precious hours of debugging.</p>

<p>The more popular a package is the more issues and questions arise for that package. Keep this in mind when you consider to contact authors as maintaining a popular package can be a lot of work. Make sure to be kind and solution oriented (despite being frustrated and annoyed that your code is failing). Also, once you post an issue/pull request make sure that you <strong>quickly answer</strong> any questions that the community has. If I post a question without getting an answer, my willingness to spend time solving the issue quickly diminishes unless it affects my own work.</p>
<h2><span id="Writing_an_issue">Writing an issue</span></h2>
<p>An issue can be of two types, (1) a bug in the software that needs correction, or (2) a feature that you want to be implemented. When you write your issue, usually on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, you should structure it similarly to the section on “Writing a good Stack Overflow question”; it should be clear what the issue is about and there should be some code example (ideally you should look at the already existing examples within the package and use that code). If you want to speed up the implementation you can suggest a solution and/or <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html">a test case</a>. Issues usually take longer time to get resolved than Stack Overflow questions and sometimes I write my issue first on Stack Overflow so that I am certain that I haven’t missed something in the manual.</p>
<p>Before you write an issue it can be a good idea to see if the problem has already an existing issue. Note that some issues may still exist and have been closed (make sure to remove “<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests">is:open</a>” for GitHub searches) as the author may have decided that it isn’t an issue that is fixeable or where there already is a working solution. </p>
<h2><span id="Make_a_pull_request">Make a pull request</span></h2>
<p>If you have found the source of the issue and your fairly certain that this is the cause of the problem, then do a pull request (also know as a PR). In addition to fixing the problem you should add <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html">a test case</a> (unless you are changing the manual), this makes it much easier for the author to understand the problem and trust the solution. Make sure to follow each author’s coding style, e.g. if someone uses CamelCase then you should also be using CamelCase. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">Linting</a> is not yet that common in languages such as R (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/jimhester/lintr">lintr</a>), but judging from developments in more popular languages, we can expect linting to become commonplace the coming decade. By making sure that you follow the style that the author has chosen, it usually becomes easier to read and understand code as a homogenous style allows you to focus more on the code intention than on argument spacing, brackets etc.</p>
<p>In GitHub creating a <em>pull request</em> is <a href="https://linuxhint.com/pull_request_github/">fairly easy</a>, fork the repository with the package, do your changes and then click on pull request once you have uploaded the changes.  A pull request can be done alone or in combination with writing an issue. I often add an issue if it is a somewhat more complex issue that I am addressing.</p>
<h2><span id="E-mail">E-mail</span></h2>
<p>I sometimes receive e-mails from users asking questions. Usually I try to refer everyone to Stack Overflow as I believe that e-mailed questions scale poorly; <a href="https://github.com/gforge/htmlTable">htmlTable</a> has 160 000+ downloads/month and therefore it is reasonable that all support should be available through a Google-search. I often encourage people to e-mail me a link to a Stack Overflow question that has gone unanswered for a week and then I can have a look at it.</p>

<p>At the core of the open source community is that everyone can contribute. Contribution can be simple and seeing something you wrote being used, is surprisingly satisfying.</p>
<h2><span id="First_steps">First steps</span></h2>
<p>Try to take the time to look for questions on Stack Overflow that you can answer or if you know a package well, look into all the issues that people have with that package and see if your knowledge can help them. Many of the posted issues have already existing functionality that the users haven’t found.</p>
<h2><span id="Improve_a_package">Improve a package</span></h2>
<p>Writing and maintaining a package is a lot of work, I would therefore suggest that you look for already existing solutions and look for what is missing something. The easiest starting point is to ask yourself what in the manual doesn’t make sense and suggest changes. There are always things that can be improved upon and as an author you often become myopic and fail to see everything from spelling mistakes to errors/ambiguities.</p>
<p>Remember that the sky is the limit. Some of the best features in my packages come from suggestions that I have gotten from others. Sometimes getting the core functionality in place takes so much …</p></div></div>

September 8, 2020 | https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/how-facebook-created-their-mobile-advertising-business/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/how-facebook-created-their-mobile-advertising-business/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Half-way through 2012, you’d have been forgiven for thinking that Facebook was doing a MySpace. In other words, Facebook was on a fast path to slow, painful decline.</p>
<p>Yahoo had just sued Facebook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-facebook-lawsuit/yahoo-sues-facebook-for-infringing-10-patents-idUSBRE82B18M20120312">for patent infringement</a>. Zuck - like Steve Jobs before him - had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">bet too early</a> on the mobile web, and Facebook’s HTML5-powered apps were slow and buggy. Some argued that Zuck had overpaid for Instagram - $1billion for a 12 person company with no revenue, valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/right-before-acquisition-instagram-closed-50m-at-a-500m-valuation-from-sequoia-thrive-greylock-and-benchmark/">half that amount</a> a week before Facebook bought it.</p>
<p>The share price was tanking, having lost more than half its value just 3 months after going public. In Q3 2012 the company posted a net loss - it’s second quarter as a public company. And, though more than 50% of monthly active users visited Facebook on mobile, those users generated almost no advertising revenue.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough to finish Facebook off, advertisers weren’t exactly flocking to it, either.</p>
<p>Google’s search ads had earned a reputation as “the new standard” in the world of direct response advertising. They were easy to buy, easy to optimise, and it was easy enough to measure the impact of them. Google had tapped directly into a “standards-based” form of brand advertising, too. Adsense enabled advertisers to buy - through auction, at scale - display ads in standard IAB formats across hundreds of thousands of websites. Plug in your existing messages and creative, pick your audience, and go. SMBs loved it.</p>

<em>Exactly how many questions could be a in a Question ad?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In stark contrast, Facebook ads were almost impossible to buy. There were 27 different ad units to choose from. Facebook’s “Ads and Sponsored Stories Guide” was <a href="https://allfacebook.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Facebook-Ads-and-Sponsored-Stories-Guide-Januar-2013.pdf">45 pages long</a>. To ensure maximum reach to Facebook’s audience on desktop and mobile, advertisers were required to create a gazillion images of various different dimensions and ratios. An infestation of bugs paused ad campaigns for no discernable reason (usually on Fridays, for entire weekends). Even worse, GM - one of the biggest brand advertisers on Facebook - publicly said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304192704577406394017764460">Facebook ads didn’t work</a>.</p>
<p>For a newly-listed company, with an advertising-based business model, the situation looked pretty bleak. Facebook was surely destined to join MySpace and Friendster in the dot-com deadpool.</p>
<p>Of course, as we now know, that never actually happened. Less than a year later, when Facebook announced Q2 2013 earnings, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553942/facebooks-q2-2013-earnings-beat-expectations-on-revenue-and-profit">stock shot up 21% in after hours trading</a> after an earnings beat. Mobile accounted for 41% of revenue, up from 30% the quarter before. Facebook reported its first quarter with over 1 million active advertisers. Advertising revenue in “International” markets (EMEA, APAC, and LATAM) was doubling year-over-year. ARPU - a helpful metric to understand advertising auction demand - was growing faster than ever ($1.60 in Q2 2013, it’s $7.26 today).</p>
<p>How the heck did that happen? Simple answer: some good old <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/wtf-is-a--platform/" title="What is a Platform?">platform thinking</a>. And rationalizing.</p>
<p>When Facebook’s Ads Product team solicited feedback from marketers, it came thick and fast. It wasn’t great. Creating campaigns was equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming. Marketers were already investing time and money to create “organic” content on Facebook, like Page Posts. Adding 27 ad formats to the mix would create additional “work-work” for them.</p>
<p>To build empathy with the people they were serving, Ads PMs started adding the likes of David Ogilvy and Marshall McLuhan to their “must read” lists. And they started talking to the Ads API ecosystem more. Turns out the “work-work” problem was affecting developers, too. There were multiple ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through Facebook’s Marketing APIs. Internal confusion had been externalised to them. Wasting time re-inventing the wheel and implementing a constant barrage of new, different ad formats ate up their innovation budget.</p>
<p>A simpler approach was required. Marketers, developers, and Facebook were counting on it.</p>

<em>Paul Adams (now SVP Product at Intercom) was a Facebook Ads PM around then, and used simple diagrams like this to explain the “messages, containers, channels” idea.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook’s Ads team quickly realised advertising on Facebook shouldn’t be all that different from advertising through any medium, old or new. It didn’t matter if was billboards, newspapers, magazines, leaflets, display ads, search ads, social ads, or emails, the basics were the same - marketers wanted to get messages in front of people, to drive a response.</p>
<p>The channels may vary, and containers within those channels may vary, but the messages and objectives were the same. And, of course, the best messages were those that started new relationships between businesses and customers.</p>
<p>This simple insight brought clarity to the conversation, and to the roadmap. Marketers were already creating “messages” on Facebook, after all - Page Posts. Instead of creating “ads” why not make it so that marketers could simply pay to get their existing messages in front of more people?</p>
<p>And, if these messages contained images - wasn’t that just the same thing as “ad creative?”</p>
<p>And, if these messages already appeared in users’ feeds, didn’t “feed” also mean “mobile feed”?</p>
<p>And, if marketers paid to promote these messages in “mobile feed,” aren’t they “mobile ads?”</p>
<p>The penny dropped.</p>
<p>For a self-proclaimed “platform company,” the approach to serving marketers and developers hadn’t been “platform-ey” at all. Lots of complexity, no consistency. Lots of distinct features were built, not rationalized capabilities. The feedback shared by marketers and developers was spot on - there <em>were</em> so many ways to do similar things - or the same thing - through every ads interface, not just Facebook’s APIs. An embarrassing oversight, but fixable with the right framework.</p>
<p>Changes came thick and fast. In June 2013, Fidji Simo penned - on behalf of the Ads Product team - “<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2013/06/an-update-on-facebook-ads/">an update on Facebook Ads</a>.” She used words like <em>simplify</em>, <em>consistent</em>, <em>redundancies</em>, <em>streamline</em>, and <em>objectives</em> to describe what was changing. Messages and images would gracefully degrade, depending on where they were delivered to people. The number of ad units would be reduced from 27 to fewer than half of that. Her final sentence summarised the changes well:</p>
<p>“We think these updates will make it easier for them (marketers) to do what they do best: reach the right groups of people with the right message and drive the results they care most about.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>

  <img alt="containerschannels" title="containerschannels" src="https://www.developerecosystem.com/static/2c099bcf6c20f0f3df0ef051023d6f53/8a905/containerschannels.jpg" srcset="https://www.developerecosystem.com/static/2c099bcf6c20f0f3df0ef051023d6f53/5a8b5/containerschannels.jpg 173w,

    </span></p>
<p><em>Different containers, different channels, same message.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say that Fidji was right is a mild understatement. Since 2012, marketers have <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/2496/facebook-revenue-by-segment/">invested over $167billion in mobile advertising through Facebook</a>. In the 3rd quarter of 2019, mobile advertising represented 94% of Facebook’s overall advertising revenue. And, not all of that revenue came from the “big blue” Facebook app.</p>
<p>By simplifying the concept of a “message” reaching the “right groups of people” to “drive results,” advertisers could extend their advertising campaigns to Instagram and Facebook Audience Network with no additional effort. The messages they created would simply be presented in different types of containers, on different channels. When ads on Facebook Messenger appeared, the same messages created for Facebook and Instagram “gracefully degraded” to fit the containers on that new channel.</p>
<p>Even better, ads could quite literally be a new way to start a conversation with customers - through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. It was easy. SMBs loved it.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop there - life for developers improved, too. The process of integrating with Facebook’s Ads APIs became easier, and - by rationalizing across interfaces, including APIs - developers had more headspace and capacity to innovate. New Facebook Marketing Partners emerged with innovative solutions. Some, like Wix, created solutions to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/07/14/wixs-integration-with-facebook-lets-you-create-page-post-ad-campaigns-via-wix-shoutout-newsletters/">extend the reach of email marketing campaigns to Facebook</a>. Others, like StitcherAds and Smartly.io enabled marketers to create <a href="https://stitcherads.com/digital-circulars/">digital circulars</a> and <a href="https://www.smartly.io/">data-fuelled ad creative</a>. As of March 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2019/05/17/helsinki-born-kristo-ovaska-built-smartly-io-for-a-facebook-driven-ad-world/#799bce6d23df">almost $2 billion of Facebook’s annual revenue</a> flows through Smartly.io - just one partner, based in Finland. There are more like them.</p>
<p>Facebook may have solved the “reach the right groups of people with the right message” problem well for advertisers within their own walled garden, but that doesn’t mean they’ve solved it for every business in the world. These days, the volume of inbound and outbound messages - emails, SMS, WhatsApp, and the rest - is ever increasing. A challenge for everyone, not just marketers.</p>
<p>Every team, in every business, wrestles with an infinite stream of inbound messages, and outbound messages that need to land in various apps and inboxes, on a myriad of devices, formatted in different ways. The number of “channels” is exploding, not consolidating. These days, TikTok is the new Tencent, Twilio is the new Telephone. <a href="https://www.developerecosystem.com/posts/browsers--not-apps--are-still-the-future-of-mobile/" title="Browsers, not apps, are still the future of mobile">WhatsApp and WeChat are the new browsers</a>. Email and SMS are alive and well. But, just like Facebook advertising back in the day, managing all of this can be equally intimidating, confusing and time consuming.</p>
<p>The likes of Twilio - now a $40billion market cap company - are using terms like <em>omni-channel</em>, <em>programmable conversations</em> and <em>conversational messaging</em> to describe their capability to process and route inbound messages to the right teams, and route outbound messages to recipients on the channels they are most engaged with. Channels they ingest from and output to include email, SMS, voice, WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Telegram, and many, many more.</p>
<p>If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it should be. “Graceful degradation” and orchestration of inbound and outbound messages across channels is uncannily similar to the “platform thinking” Facebook applied to create an entirely new multi-billion dollar mobile ads business.</p>
<p>This challenge, by itself, creates a market opportunity far greater than Facebook or Google's market cap. These days, the opportunity can be sized in terms of $trillions, …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <p>The reason I wrote my <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/07/08/barebones-webgl-in-75-lines-of-code.html">last</a> <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/07/21/barebones-3d-rendering-with-webgl.html">two</a> posts on WebGL is because I want to write about my undergraduate research from my time at college. My <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-165.html">original paper</a> was written with a bunch of messy C++ code, and I want to do two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Make the concepts behind my research more accessible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make the results from my research available to people without needing to compile and install additional software. That means WebGL!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Today, I’ll start with some background material: curves and moving frames. While you don’t need to install new software to play with the demos, you will at least need a sufficiently new browser that supports WebGL and modern Javascript features (like modules).</p>

<h2 id="properties-of-curves">Properties of curves</h2>

<p>When you describe a curve in any number of dimensions, there are two important properties involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>tangent</strong> vector at a given point, describing where the curve is headed from that point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>normal</strong> vector at a given point, perpendicular to the tangent. In certain cases, which I’ll talk about more below, the normal describes where the <em>tangent</em> is headed from that point.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Intuitively, the tangent points <em>along</em> the curve, and the normal points <em>away</em> from it.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with calculus, you may notice I’m describe rates of change, meaning derivatives. Indeed, based on the above definitions, the tangent is simply the derivative of the curve with respect to position and the normal is the derivative of the tangent! This also means, if we have a bunch of discrete points that define a curve, we can approximate these derivatives using finite differences:</p>

\[\begin{alignat}{2}
\vec{\mathbf{t}}(t) &amp;= \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{\mathbf{x}}}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;\approx \frac{\vec{\mathbf{x}}(t + h) - \vec{\mathbf{x}}(t - h)}{2h} \\
\vec{\mathbf{n}}(t) &amp;= \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{\mathbf{t}}}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;\approx \frac{\vec{\mathbf{t}}(t + h) - \vec{\mathbf{t}}(t - h)}{2h}
\end{alignat}\]

<p><em>(All of this is subtly wrong, but I’ll talk later about what’s wrong and how to fix it.)</em></p>

<p>Take the surrounding points, find their difference, then divide by the distance between the points. The closer the discrete points, the better the approximation. The same goes for the normal, but this time calculating the differences between the surrounding tangents.</p>

<p>Because these two vectors are rates of change, they have magnitude describing how fast the curve or the tangent are changing. For our purposes, however, we only care about the direction of the change. But, the magnitude of the normal will give us some insight, so in the following interactive demo, I’ve plotted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The fixed-size tangent vector.</li>
  <li>The “actual” normal vector (scaled so it’s visible).</li>
  <li>The fixed-size normal vector.</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll notice that the approximation gets better—the tangent and normal point in the directions you intuitively expect—with more samples along the curve. This is because the step size, the $h$ in the above formulas, gets smaller.</p>

<p>The other very important observation is how the normal behaves around the middle of the curve. In the middle is the <em>inflection</em> point, the point where the curve switches from curving in one direction to curving in the other direction. At that point, the curve approximates a straight line, meaning the tangent is not changing direction and the normal is essentially the zero vector.</p>

<p>This also means the normal points down on one side of the inflection point, getting smaller and smaller until it starts getting bigger on the other side. The unit-length normal vector suddenly switches directions, which will come back to bite us shortly.</p>

<h3 id="arc-length-parameterization">Arc-length parameterization</h3>

<p>I said above my explanation of the tangent and normal are subtly wrong. The problem is the tangent and the normal should be inherent properties of the curve, regardless of how you represent it.</p>

<p>That means the tangent and the normal are generally represented based on the <em>arc-length parameterization</em>, and the calculations above only work under this parameterization. Intuitively, we need to sample points evenly spaced along the curve, as seen in the visualization below:</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-09-08-rendering-curves-in-3d/time-vs-arc-length-parameterization.png" alt="The same curve rendered twice a series of dots. On the left, the dots are bunched up in the middle, and on the right, the dots are spread out evenly throughout the curve."></p>
  <figcaption>The time and arc-length parameterizations of the same curve</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the left, because of how the curve is defined (as a cubic Bézier curve), sampling at “evenly-spaced” intervals causes our samples to bunch up in the middle. This basically means the curve is moving slower near the middle and faster near the ends. What we actually want to do is pick samples that end up evenly-spaced, like on the right side. We want curve to move at the same speed all throughout.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, generating the arc-length parameterization is not easy to do in general. Luckily, for the applications I’m talking about, it doesn’t matter! If we take enough samples, the samples will be close enough that the finite differences approximation will work out. <strong>One caveat is that when computing the normal, you need to normalize the tangent vectors first.</strong> Remember, in the arc-length parameterization, samples are evenly-spaced, meaning the tangent is always a fixed length. Only then is the normal the derivative of the tangent.</p>

<h2 id="the-frenet-serret-frame">The Frenet-Serret frame</h2>

<p>If you want to render a 1D curve as a 3D model, you need an orientation for the various cross sections. For example, if you’re describing a snake as a curve, you need a direction that counts as “up”. You can see this in the image below:</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-09-08-rendering-curves-in-3d/curve-with-moving-frames.png" alt="A 1D curve with multiple square cross-sections along the curve. Also along the curve are arrows pointing in the chosen &quot;up&quot; direction."></p>
  <figcaption>A 3D rendering is a series of cross sections along a curve, all of which require an orientation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, how do you define the orientation of the cross sections? Well, you need one vector that’s perpendicular to the tangent. That vector doesn’t need to be your “up” vector, as long as it’s always related in the same way to the “up” vector on each cross section. And, we have such a vector: the normal!</p>

<p>This observation is the key to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet%E2%80%93Serret_formulas"><strong>Frenet-Serret frame</strong></a>. To define an oriented plane in which a cross section will lie:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Start with the unit-length normal vector at the point in question. This is our <strong>reference vector</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the tangent is perpendicular to the cross section’s plane, you can take the cross product of the tangent and the normal ($\hat{\mathbf{t}} \times \hat{\mathbf{n}}$) to get another unit-length vector on the cross section’s plane. In fact, this vector will be perpendicular to the normal vector. Call this new vector $\hat{\mathbf{b}}$ for “binormal” vector.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, you have two vectors, $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{b}}$ that define your plane, and you can orient your cross section accordingly. For example, you might just make the binormal vector your “up” direction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is where we run into the problem with the normal vector suddenly flipping directions. If the curve has an inflection point, then the cross section will suddenly rotate $180^{\circ}$. You can see that in the following demo:</p>

<figure>
  <canvas id="container-3d-frenet-serret" width="512" height="256"></canvas>
<figcaption>The Frenet-Serret frame suddenly flips orientation around an inflection point</figcaption>

<p>(<a href="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-09-08-rendering-curves-in-3d/fallback-frenet-serret.png">Link to screenshot</a> if your browser isn’t new enough.)</p>

<h2 id="the-rotation-minimizing-frame">The Rotation Minimizing Frame</h2>

<p>Luckily, we can fix this problem using the <strong>Rotation Minimizing Frame</strong> or <strong>RMF</strong>. The paper <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Computation-of-rotation-minimizing-frames.pdf"><em>Computation of Rotation Minimizing Frames</em></a> goes over both the definition and an efficient calculation of the RMF, but intuitively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of using the normal as the reference vector, we want to choose a reference vector that doesn’t rotate around the tangent so much. In fact, formally, the ideal reference vector’s first derivative is in the same direction as the tangent, meaning the reference vector only moves along the tangent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And, in order to be a reference vector for the cross section we care about, the reference vector has to remain perpendicular to the tangent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the paper explains, the RMF is defined by a set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), so finding the true solution is not trivial in general. Luckily, the algorithm presented in the paper is really easy to implement (I won’t go over the details here) and approximates the true solution <em>really</em> well. You can see how well the RMF behaves in the next demo:</p>

<figure>
  <canvas id="container-3d-rmf" width="512" height="256"></canvas>
<figcaption>The Rotation Minimizing Frame maintains its orientation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>(<a href="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-09-08-rendering-curves-in-3d/fallback-rmf.png">Link to screenshot</a> if your browser isn’t new enough.)</p>

<p>The only caveat here is we need an initial frame to start off the process. In the above demo, I’ve used the Frenet-Serret frame at $t = 0$, but in real applications, you’ll probably want to manually specify the initial frame. This is especially important for curves where the the normal is zero at the beginning of the curve because the curve starts off like a straight line.</p>

<h2 id="closed-loops-and-torsion">Closed loops and torsion</h2>

<p>A curious thing can happen if the curve is a closed loop that doesn’t lie on one plane. Take a look at the following curve:</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-09-08-rendering-curves-in-3d/closed-loop-with-mismatched-ends.png" alt="A curve that is not planar. The two ends meet, but by the time the curve comes back to itself, the RMF has rotated 180 degrees."></p>
  <figcaption>An non-planar curve might end up with misaligned ends</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>(I need to do some work before I can render this curve properly in WebGL. I’ll replace the picture with an interactive demo when I implement the necessary functionality.)</p>

<p>Even though the cross sections are created using Rotation Minimizing Frames, the starting and ending cross sections don’t line up with each other. In fact, I created this curve so that the starting and ending frames are exactly $180^{\circ}$ apart!</p>

<p>I’ll talk more about why this happens in later articles, as this very phenomenon was the subject of my research.</p>

<h2 id="technologies-used">Technologies used</h2>

<p>If you’re curious, I used the following technologies for the visualizations in this article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://preactjs.com/">Preact</a> - a React-like DOM rendering library. Used for the 2D visualization, which reacts to the sliders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> - a 3D rendering library that makes it easy to render WebGL content. It helped me to first understand WebGL (I even initially wrote all my rendering from scratch) before I started using an abstraction over it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://unpkg.com/">Unpkg</a> for making it easy to import libraries from a CDN.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

                            There are a few reasons you may need to be able to prove who you are without revealing who you are.</p><p>
                            
                            Suppose you desire to share many different pieces of information online but must remain anonymous for security reasons. Since you are anonymous, you have no reputation online and therefore no trust or credibility.<br>
                            You can release one piece of information that will later prove to be true, thus gaining credibility for yourself. People will now take your information seriously, except you were fully anonymous, so that credibility is useless to you as you can't claim it in the future when sharing future information.<br>
                            What's worse, others may impersonate you, claiming to be the original author of the first piece of information, and then share bad information thus soiling all of the credibility you built up.</p><p>
                            
                            With AnoProof you can sign your first piece of information with an AnoProof signature using your AnoProof secret key.<br>
                            Now, once it gains credibility, you can sign your future informations with your same secret key.<br>
                            Using AnoProof, anyone can verify that the future information (signed) was authored by the same anonymous author as the original credible information.
                            </p></div><hr>
                            <p>
                            AnoProof doesn't always have to be used anonymously, another great use-case for AnoProof is in proving your known identity, online, in an ever increasing world of spoofing, deep-fakes, and general impersonation.</p><p>
                            
                            Consider the <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/leoni-ag-email-scam-40-million-ceo-hack-september-2016/">case of Leoni AG</a>, in which the CEO instructed the CFO to wire transfer $40m to an offshore account, the only problem for the CFO, it wasn't a true eMail from the CEO, it was a hacker pretending to be the CEO.<br>
                            Had the company policy been that all instructions of such nature must be signed with an AnoProof signature, the CFO could have easily proven that the hackers weren't the CEO.</p><p>
                            
                            This example was just a simple eMail spoofing, but imagine a few years from now when DeepFakes, SIM spoofing, and a combination of other tools will allow a hacker to video call one of your employees, and pretend to be you not only with caller ID but visibly and audibly as well.<br>
                            Signing protocols like AnoProof will become more and more necessary in the identity verification crisis realm AI will bring us towards.</p><hr>
                            <p>
                            To use AnoProof, simply paste, verbatim, two messages that have AnoProof signatures, in the text boxes at the bottom of this page, then tap the 'Verify' button.</p><p>

<p><em>Written by Cody Burkard, Senior Security Consultant, mnemonic</em></p>

<h2>Tl;dr</h2>
<p>mnemonic researchers have discovered a new technique for escalating privileges within Azure environments through the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure Active Directory. Organizations that employ dynamic groups for assigning user roles and rights should review their Azure Active Directory configuration to ensure they are not susceptible to this attack.</p>

<h2>Cloud security != On-prem security</h2>
<p>As organizations continue to migrate parts or all of their infrastructure to the cloud, security personnel need to adapt and understand the threats related to this cloud transition. At first glance, this doesn’t appear all too complicated, and security teams can take similar approaches to networking security as they have in traditional on-premise networks: VPNs for connectivity, network segmentation, network security appliances, agents, hardened virtual machines, etc. While these are all valid security measures for cloud infrastructure, they don’t address security concerns related to the management of infrastructure and users in the cloud.</p>
<p>For example, consider an adversary that is targeting a VM on an internal Azure network. The adversary cannot gain network access to the private Azure VNet that the VM resides on, but finds the password to an account in Azure AD. If the compromised user account has access to modify the infrastructure within Azure, they can bypass network and host-level security controls. The adversary could simply update the VM so that they may access it, or directly execute code on it. This scenario is shown below:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/contentassets/1e70019b2fd44c0eaba8f5e8a3a88fff/managementplaneattack-1.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/contentassets/1e70019b2fd44c0eaba8f5e8a3a88fff/managementplaneattack-1.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This is a very simple example of pivoting into infrastructure through Azure’s “management plane”, which is used by legitimate users to manage infrastructure. This scenario is dependent on an adversary compromising an account in AAD that has privileges to run commands on VMs within the Azure infrastructure.</p>
<p>This may seem like a somewhat naïve and simple example given the requirement for a pre-compromised AAD account with special permissions in Azure. However, commonly successful techniques such as phishing, password cracking or identification of leaked secrets can lead to the compromise of an AAD account. If an account compromised using one of those techniques does not have administrative permissions, then the goal of the adversary is to identify some privileged escalation that helps them gain higher permissions.</p>
<p>The remainder of this blog post focuses on the topic of elevating privileges in Azure infrastructure with a previously compromised Azure AD account. A full summary of previous work on this topic will be contained in a future post, whereas this post will focus on a new technique targeting AAD dynamic groups.</p>

<h2>Some background on Azure Active Directory</h2>
<p>Let’s start by clearing the air about Azure vs Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD).</p>
<p>When we talk about Azure, many folks jump straight to thinking about Azure Active Directory, or even Office 365. This is a common point of confusion. Microsoft has a large cloud ecosystem that is tied together with identity management and authentication through Azure Active Directory.</p>
<p>Azure Active Directory uses “tenants” to represent different organizations and environments within a company’s Microsoft cloud ecosystem, and includes a collection of users, groups and rights.&nbsp; Any one tenant may be connected to a single Office365 account, any number of Azure subscriptions, Dynamics365, Outlook, and other Microsoft cloud services.</p>
<p>So while the same Azure AD users may be used for all of these services, Azure AD is <em>not</em> a part of Azure nor a part of Office 365. Azure AD is a separate entity that handles user management and authentication, and has tight integrations with other Microsoft services.</p>
<p>With this straight, let’s briefly cover a few other basic topics that are relevant for the privilege escalation technique.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Roles in Azure AD are top-level roles in the Microsoft Azure AD tenant for Azure AD users. At the time of writing this article, the assignment of some admin roles to Service Principal objects is also in preview. Azure AD roles allow users or service principals to perform actions including, but not limited, to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managing security groups</li>
<li>Managing users</li>
<li>Accessing Azure infrastructure</li>
<li>Creating and managing Azure AD applications (Service Principals)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot illustrates some of these Azure AD Roles in Azure Portal:&nbsp;</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/azure-2.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<h3><strong>Azure RBAC Roles</strong></h3>
<p>Azure RBAC (role-based access control) roles govern access to the infrastructure deployed within Azure. This is a large and complicated topic, but the important thing to understand here is that RBAC roles determine what actions an Azure AD principal can take on specific resources deployed in Azure. For example, to deploy a VM, a user must be assigned an RBAC role that includes that action, such as owner or contributor.</p>
<h3><strong>Azure AD Security Groups</strong></h3>
<p>In Azure AD, users can be added into logical groups to help with user and access management. Azure RBAC roles and Azure AD roles can then be assigned to these groups (Azure AD role assignments to groups is in preview at the time of writing). This means that any user that is added to a group will then inherit the roles assigned to that group.</p>

<h2>The technique – abusing dynamic groups</h2>
<p>While researching and testing Azure deployments, I stumbled upon an interesting privilege escalation vector: the abuse of dynamic groups in Azure AD.</p>
<h3><strong>What are dynamic groups?</strong></h3>
<p>Dynamic groups in Azure AD allow administrators to automatically assign group memberships to users based on attributes of that user. For example, if a company has two offices in Oslo and London, they may create security groups for each of their offices. They can use dynamic groups based on the user’s “city” attribute for this purpose, so that whenever a new user is added to Azure AD, they will automatically be added to one of these two groups.</p>
<p>The following picture shows how you would do this with a dynamic group rule:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-3.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>This use case is fairly innocent. But let’s think of a more security sensitive case.</p>
<h3><strong>A real-world scenario for the attack</strong></h3>
<p>An organization creates a dynamic group called VM Contributors, which has VM Contributor Access scoped to the subscription:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/dynamicgroup-4.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now, this organization outsources all VM management to a company called “Bluefish”, and Bluefish uses the following naming convention:</p>

<p>To automate the process of Bluefish users being assigned VM Contributor, a rule is added to dynamically add any user with “bluefish” in the userPrincipalName (UPN) to the VM Contributor group. Seems reasonable and innocuous, since users cannot modify their UPN without appropriate access rights, and the organization has locked these down.</p>



<div>

    <figure>

<h3><strong>Time to escalate some privileges</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s assume for our scenario that an adversary gains access to a low-privileged user in Azure AD, which resides in no groups or Azure RBAC roles. The compromised user has the “Global Reader” role, so the attacker can read configurations in the directory, but cannot change settings, and therefore cannot use traditional methods to change access rights to their own user, or to other users.</p>
<p>The attacker finds the dynamic membership rule, and wants to find a way to trigger the dynamic rule for an account they control. In short, the attacker needs to get the name “bluefish” in the UPN attribute of their user:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">

        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/userprofile-6.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Since users with the Global Reader role cannot edit any configurations, the attacker cannot edit their own UPN and is stuck.</p>
<h3><strong>UPN</strong></h3>
<p>User Principal Names are based on user email addresses. I have identified dynamic groups based on this attribute in the past, and on the surface seems to be okay because users generally cannot change their own email addresses. This requires administrative privileges within Azure AD and a role such as “User Administrator”. However, there is a way around this…</p>
<h3><strong>Abusing Guest Accounts</strong></h3>
<p>By default, users in Azure AD can invite guest users to the directory. Since the UPN of a guest user is still based on email addresses, an adversary can simply create a new email address from any email provider, such as Gmail, that contains “bluefish” in the address. For example:</p>

<p>If the attacker invites this email to the azure tenant:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/inviteguestuser-7.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>And then accepts the invite, the user will become a user in the local directory with an interesting UPN:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/newuser-8.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now we can go into the portal and check our group assignments:</p>



<div>
        <a href="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=1600&amp;quality=60">
    <figure>
        <img src="https://www.mnemonic.no/globalassets/blog-bilder/groupmembership-9.png?width=790&amp;factor=2&amp;quality=60" alt="" itemprop="image">
    </figure>
        </a>
</div>
<p>Now the attacker has access to the testDynamicGroup, which assigns the VM contributor role through a dynamic group membership.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attacker starts with a Global Reader in Azure AD</li>
<li>The attacker finds a dynamic group with the VM Contributor role assigned
<ol>
<li>Membership is dynamic based on the string “bluefish” existing in the UPN</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The attacker can invite guests, as per the default setting</li>
<li>The attacker invites a guest Gmail account with bluefish in the address - <span data-e="402D2F236E2C29212D27002833292625352C222432212B3235222423"></span></li>
<li>The guest account triggers the dynamic group after accepting, and inherits the VM Contributor role in Azure RBAC</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Notes on dynamic group abuse</strong></h3>
<p>In this example, we show how dynamic groups based on a UPN can be abused using a guest account. However, there are many other attributes for determining dynamic group membership, and different types of attackers could abuse each. <strong>When setting up dynamic groups, consider whether lower privileged users or external attackers could modify the attributes that define that group.</strong></p>
<p>The following are other potential attack paths to modify user attributes on dynamic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>AD Connect Sync – An attacker may modify user attributes in an on-premise system, and Azure AD Connect …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>This article is part of a running series that attempts to demystify
microservices by showing developers how they can create a set of microservice
using their favorite frameworks and protocols. Each article includes details on
how to write and run a microservice and a consuming client service in tandem.</em></p>

<p>Microservices can seem intimidating at first, but at the end of the day they're
just regular applications. They can execute tasks, listen for requests, connect
to databases, and everything else a regular API or process would do. We only
call them <em>micro</em>services colloquially because of the way we use them, not
because they are inherently small.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we'll demystify the creation and operation of microservices for
Node.js developers by creating a microservice using a popular Node.js framework,
<a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>. We won't go into detail about the design or
architecture of NestJS applications specifically, so if you're unfamiliar with
the framework I'd recommend you check out its docs first, or simply skip to
another one of our
<a href="https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli/tree/master/examples/react-app">Node.js samples</a>
that uses <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> directly.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-nestjs-microservice"><a href="#creating-a-nestjs-microservice" aria-label="creating a nestjs microservice permalink"></a>Creating a NestJS microservice</h2>
<p>NestJS is an opinionated framework for developing server-side Node.js
applications, including, but not limited to, microservices. Their default walk
throughs and tutorials all show how to create and operate a REST API using
NestJS, but in this tutorial we'll show how to use some of their other helpful
microservice libraries to create and operate a TCP-based microservice.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.architect.io/images/blog/nestjs-microservices-simple/tcp-services.png" alt="TCP services"></p>
<p>To start, let's download NestJS's CLI to help us bootstrap our new microservice
project. The CLI will do all the work to build the project skeleton making it a
lot easier for us to make the changes we need:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new nestjs-microservice</code></pre></div>
<p>Once the application has been fully initialized, we're going to install the
NestJS microservices library to help us modify the boilerplate application from
an http-based REST API to a TCP-based microservice:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i --save @nestjs/microservices</code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed, go ahead and replace the contents of your <code>src/main.ts</code> file
with the following:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> NestFactory <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/core'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> Transport <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppModule <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'src/app.module'</span><span>;</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>bootstrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> port <span>=</span> process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>PORT</span> <span>?</span> <span>Number</span><span>(</span>process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>PORT</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>8080</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> app <span>=</span> <span>await</span> NestFactory<span>.</span><span>createMicroservice</span><span>(</span>AppModule<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
    transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
    options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      host<span>:</span> <span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>,</span>
      port<span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>await</span> app<span>.</span><span>listen</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Microservice listening on port:'</span><span>,</span> port<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>bootstrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you're already familiar with NestJS, this file should be easy to read
through. The only unique part is how we're initializing the application –
instead of using the default <code>NestFactory.create()</code> method, we're using
<code>NestFactory.createMicroservice()</code> which provides us additional controls over
the protocols and contracts our application responds to:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>const</span> app <span>=</span> <span>await</span> NestFactory<span>.</span><span>createMicroservice</span><span>(</span>AppModule<span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
  options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    host<span>:</span> <span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>,</span>
    port<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above snippet, we're declaring that our microservice responds to <code>TCP</code>
requests and listens on our configurable port (defaults to <code>8080</code>). This means
our service won't be a REST API, but will respond to a more raw request format.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at the generated controller which defines the routes and
methods our API responds to, <code>src/app.controller.ts</code>. Since our microservices
responds to TCP requests instead of HTTP, we'll need to change the annotations
on our controller methods to respond to more relevant request structures. Go
ahead and paste the contents below into the file:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Controller <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> MessagePattern <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Controller</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppController</span> <span>{</span>
  @<span>MessagePattern</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> cmd<span>:</span> <span>'hello'</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>hello</span><span>(</span>input<span>?</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hello, </span><span><span>${</span>input <span>||</span> <span>'there'</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the way we define and annotate NestJS controllers remains the
same as the generated project code, but the way we annotate methods within our
controllers is different. Instead of using <code>@Get()</code>, <code>@Post()</code>, and other
http-specific annotations, we define our TCP interfaces using
<code>@MessagePattern()</code> – an annotation that maps controller methods to incoming
requests so long as they match the provided pattern. In our case, we've defined
the pattern to be any request that contains <code>{ cmd: 'hello' }</code>. We also expect
the request payload to be an optional string that will be used to enrich our
response:</p>
<div data-language="ts"><pre><code><span>hello</span><span>(</span>input<span>?</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span>Hello, </span><span><span>${</span>input <span>||</span> <span>'there'</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Great! Now let's make sure our microservice will start up. Our NestJS project
came pre-baked with a <code>package.json</code> file that includes all the appropriate
start commands, so let's use the one designed for local development:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> run start:dev
<span>[</span><span>5</span>:41:22 PM<span>]</span> Starting compilation <span>in</span> <span>watch</span> mode<span>..</span>.
<span>[</span><span>5</span>:41:27 PM<span>]</span> Found <span>0</span> errors. Watching <span>for</span> <span>file</span> changes.
<span>[</span>Nest<span>]</span> <span>6361</span>   - 08/31/2020, <span>5</span>:41:28 PM   <span>[</span>NestFactory<span>]</span> Starting Nest application<span>..</span>.
<span>[</span>Nest<span>]</span> <span>6361</span>   - 08/31/2020, <span>5</span>:41:28 PM   <span>[</span>InstanceLoader<span>]</span> AppModule dependencies initialized +20ms
<span>[</span>Nest<span>]</span> <span>6361</span>   - 08/31/2020, <span>5</span>:41:28 PM   <span>[</span>NestMicroservice<span>]</span> Nest microservice successfully started +8ms
Microservice listening on port: <span>8080</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we know the application boots correctly, let's build a <code>Dockerfile</code> for
the service. Creating a <code>Dockerfile</code> will allow our service to be built into a
portable, scalable image that anyone (or any machine) can run consistently
without issues. This means we'll be able to run it ourselves in a stable virtual
environment, we'll be able to hand it off to team members to test more easily,
and we'll be able to deploy it to production-grade environments with ease.</p>
<p>Our <code>Dockerfile</code> will inherit from an open-source node image, install npm
modules, and will run our <code>npm run build</code> command to transpile our typescript
and minimize the code footprint. Simple copy the file contents</p>
<div data-language="dockerfile"><pre><code>
<span>FROM</span> node<span>:</span>13
<span>WORKDIR</span> /usr/src/app


<span>COPY</span> package*.json tsconfig*.json ./
<span>RUN</span> npm install


<span>COPY</span> src/ src/


<span>RUN</span> npm run build


<span>RUN</span> rm <span>-</span>r src


<span>CMD</span> <span>[</span><span>"npm"</span><span>,</span> <span>"run"</span><span>,</span> <span>"start:prod"</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="creating-a-client-service"><a href="#creating-a-client-service" aria-label="creating a client service permalink"></a>Creating a client service</h2>
<p>Knowing that our microservice is booting up properly is great, but the best way
to test it in a practical setting is to see if we can extend it from another
microservice. So let's go ahead and create one!</p>
<p>Just like with the previous service, let's start by creating a new NestJS
project:</p>

<p>Let's also install two additional NestJS libraries. The first is the config
library to make it easier to parse and manage application variables, and the
second is the microservices library which contains several helper methods that
can be used to more easily access other NestJS microservices:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>npm</span> i --save @nestjs/config @nestjs/microservices</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have our required libraries installed, let's use them both together
to create a client service for accessing the microservice we created in the
previous step. Open up <code>src/app.module.ts</code> and paste in the following contents:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Module <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ConfigModule<span>,</span> ConfigService <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/config'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ClientProxyFactory<span>,</span> Transport <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> AppController <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./app.controller'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Module</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  imports<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigModule<span>.</span><span>forRoot</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  controllers<span>:</span> <span>[</span>AppController<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  providers<span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      provide<span>:</span> <span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>,</span>
      inject<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigService<span>]</span><span>,</span>
      <span>useFactory</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>configService<span>:</span> ConfigService</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        ClientProxyFactory<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
          transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
          options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            host<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_HOST'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
            port<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_PORT'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
          <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppModule</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first thing to note from the file contents above is the import of the config
module. This import allows the <code>ConfigService</code> to be utilized throughout our
application module:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>imports<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigModule<span>.</span><span>forRoot</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The next addition to the file is the <code>HELLO_SERVICE</code> provider. This is where we
use <code>ClientProxyFactory</code> from the nest microservices library to create a service
that allows us to make calls to our other microservice:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  provide<span>:</span> <span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>,</span>
  inject<span>:</span> <span>[</span>ConfigService<span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>useFactory</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>configService<span>:</span> ConfigService</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> ClientProxyFactory<span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    transport<span>:</span> Transport<span>.</span><span>TCP</span><span>,</span>
    options<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      host<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_HOST'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
      port<span>:</span> configService<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE_PORT'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the above snippet, we're registering a <code>ClientProxy</code> instance to the provider
key <code>HELLO_SERVICE</code> that points to <code>HELLO_SERVICE_HOST</code> listening on
<code>HELLO_SERVICE_PORT</code>. These two values come from the ConfigService we imported
earlier, and the values are loaded up from environment parameters. This kind pf
parameterization is crucial to enable us to run the service in multiple
environments (like dev, staging, and production) without code changes.</p>
<p>Now that we've successfully created our proxy instance, let's open up
<code>src/app.controller.ts</code> and set it up with our proxy methods. Paste the
following content into the file:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> Controller<span>,</span> Get<span>,</span> Inject<span>,</span> Param <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> ClientProxy <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/microservices'</span><span>;</span>

@<span>Controller</span><span>(</span><span>'hello'</span><span>)</span>
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>AppController</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>@<span>Inject</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>)</span> <span>private</span> client<span>:</span> ClientProxy<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>

  @<span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>':name'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>getHelloByName</span><span>(</span>@<span>Param</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span> name <span>=</span> <span>'there'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>client<span>.</span><span>send</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> cmd<span>:</span> <span>'hello'</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first thing you'll see is that we've injected an instance of our client
proxy into the controller. We registered with client under the key
<code>HELLO_SERVICE</code>, so this is the key we use to indicate which client instance we
want injected:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
  @<span>Inject</span><span>(</span><span>'HELLO_SERVICE'</span><span>)</span> <span>private</span> client<span>:</span> ClientProxy
<span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Armed with a client that points to our TCP microservice, we can start sending
requests that match the <code>@MessagePattern</code> we defined in the service:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>@<span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>':name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>getHelloByName</span><span>(</span>@<span>Para…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit. We base this on prior studies; if several large observational studies show a correlation between Vitamin D and heart disease, then this is something we should study with an RCT. </p><p id="viewer-1ofc5">
We now have results for over 1500 RCTs on Vitamin D supplementation. Some of the largest and most significant trials are listed and summarized at the end of this article. When tested on its ability to prevent disease, <strong>Vitamin D has failed to live up to expectations</strong>. </p><div id="viewer-b7fav"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Results of Vitamin D Trials "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1206,h_878,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Results of Vitamin D Trials "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">For more details, see the list of high-quality RCTs at the bottom of this page</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-en75e">One of the largest and best studies we have is called <a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VITAL</u></a>, led by Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence?postId=5f4e8bf673d853002ded6cd3" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included. Researchers do not always agree on which studies to include, and differences in inclusion criteria have led to similar meta-analyses producing opposite results. </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115934" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>This has occurred</u></a> <span>in studies of Vitamin D and fracture risk in older adults, with some meta-analyses showing zero benefit to Vitamin D and others showing a decreased risk of fracture, even though they included many of the same studies. </span></p><p id="viewer-donuf"><span>In addition to being high quality, the included studies should all try to answer the same clinical question. Many meta-analyses can only be done by combining trials that differ in important details, like the age of participants, treatment dosages, or definition of endpoints. Combining these may be feasible, but the clinical relevance may change when disparate groups are lumped together. For example, suppose we want to know if Vitamin D prevents asthma attacks in children. If a meta-analysis shows a small benefit to Vitamin D when all ages are combined, but the individual small studies in children did not show a benefit, what do I advise a 10 year old with asthma?</span></p><p id="viewer-9le66">Despite these challenges, meta-analyses of RCTs can provide meaningful insights. Unfortunately, most high-quality meta-analyses show similar results to our individual randomized controlled trials: <strong>Vitamin D does not appear to prevent disease in healthy adults.</strong> </p><p id="viewer-9hssp">But there are a few promising areas identified in meta-analyses. Note that some of these findings are not consistent with the large RCTs and will need to be studied further before definitive recommendations can be made. </p><p id="viewer-25ike">The areas in which meta-analyses have identified benefits from Vitamin D:</p><ol><li id="viewer-f3qjq"><p><strong>Fracture prevention in elderly nursing home residents </strong>(when also given with calcium):   This is not surprising.

Elderly adults who are not getting outside are more likely to be severely deficient in Vitamin D, and supplements likely help.</p></li><li id="viewer-fa0a9"><p><strong>Asthma and respiratory infection</strong>: Vitamin D seems to reduce asthma attacks in adults with mild to moderate disease, and daily or weekly Vitamin D seems to prevent acute respiratory infection in those with Vitamin D less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/l). There is considerable excitement around Vitamin D's potential role in Covid treatment, though we do not yet have enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion. </p></li><li id="viewer-d7fj2"><p><strong>Cancer mortality</strong>: Vitamin D does not appear to prevent cancer, but may reduce death rates from cancer overall (when all cancers are combined) when Vitamin D is taken for several years.

<p>I have recently come into possession of a series of exquisite miniatures which I pray are worthy of your esteemed attention. While my employers are familiar with your <em>unusual tastes</em>, they also appreciate your desire for privacy- this showing was arranged with the utmost discretion, I assure you.</p>

<p>To the untrained eye, the pieces might <em>appear</em> remarkably similar. Each canvas is a digitally-reproduced composition measuring ten pixels in height and ten pixels in width, illuminated in a strikingly intense blue.</p>

<p>To an, ahem, <em>avid collector</em> such as yourself, it is no doubt obvious that each print possesses unique <em>qualia</em>, as expounded upon by the artist’s extensive footnotes. Please, take as long as you need…</p>

</figure>

<p>In this piece, the artist used a carefully selected vintage of the <em>Macintosh</em> operating system. The desktop wallpaper color was customized to consist entirely of the desired blue, and then the <em>Preview</em> application was employed to take a screenshot and perform the necessary trimming. Tragically, <em>Preview</em> cannot save files in the <em>Graphics Interchange Format</em> (GIF).</p>

<p>In this piece, the artist manually constructed the image in the <em>Portable PixMap</em> (PPM) format using the <em>Sublime</em> text editor, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>P3

<p>The <em>ImageMagick</em> application was then used to convert it into a GIF file:</p>

<pre><code>$ convert ii.ppm ii.gif

<p>For this piece, the artist once again created a PPM image, this time using the <em>Vi, Improved</em> text editor, giving the source code a subtly crisper affect:</p>

<p>The <em>Fast Forward Moving Pictures Expert Group</em> application was then used to generate a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>$ ffmpeg -i iii.ppm iii.gif

<figcaption>Searing Light. Nano 2.0.6, POV-Ray 3.7.0</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The artist composed this piece using the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> language, composing the following script in the <em>Nano’s Another</em> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>background { rgb &lt;0, 0, 1&gt; }
</code></pre>

<p>The scene was then raytraced as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ povray +Iiv.pov +W10 +H10 +Oiv
</code></pre>

<p>As with <em>Preview</em> above, the <em>Persistence of Vision Raytracer</em> is intentionally designed not to support the creation of GIF files; output is a <em>Portable Network Graphics</em> file instead.</p>

</figure>

<p>This image was composed by the <em>Macintosh Operating System X Mach-O Gnu’s Not Unix-based assembler</em>, a utility for the creation of binary files. The <em>Sublime</em> text editor was once again employed for its neutral tone:</p>

<pre><code>.ascii "GIF89a" # magic number
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0xF0     # 2-entry global color table
.byte  0        # background color index
.byte  0        # 1:1 pixel aspect ratio

.byte  0x00     # color 0: blue
.byte  0x00
.byte  0xFF
.byte  0x00     # color 1: black
.byte  0x00
.byte  0x00

.ascii ","      # image descriptor
.long  0        # x/y offsets
.short 10       # width
.short 10       # height
.byte  0        # no local colortable
.byte  0        # minimum LZW code size
.byte  0        # end of frame

.ascii ";"      # finish
</code></pre>

<p>Curiously, the output of this assembler is prefaced with an entirely useless header, which must then be trimmed. (Hopefully future revisions of the tool will correct this obvious usability gaffe!) The composition was thus carried out as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ as v.s -o assembled.o
$ dd bs=1 skip=208 if=assembled.o of=v.gif
</code></pre>

<figcaption>Camera Obscura. oK, iKe, Safari 12.1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, the artist employed the <em>Interactive K Environment</em> (iKe), a tool based around the unfathomably esoteric programming language <em>K</em>. The tool can be used to save animated GIF images of program output; in this case, a single frame as indicated by <code>fc:1</code>. Note that <em>iKe</em> automatically doubles the size of pixels within images when rendering.</p>

<p>For this work, the artist composed an electronic mail message to a colleague as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Dear [REDACTED],
I pray this letter finds you well.

I am in grave need of your assistance. I require an opaque image file in the .GIF format,
measuring precisely 10 pixels square, consisting entirely of the hexadecimal RGB color #0000FF.
If you could provide me with such a file as an attachment, I would be immensely grateful.

Warmest Regards,
[REDACTED]

(P.S. This will make more sense later.)
</code></pre>

<p>Some time later, the artist used their electronic mail client to save the final print.</p>

<p>Here, the artist constructed a virtual machine- a sort of computing matryoshka, if you will- running the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution of the <em>Linux</em> operating system. They then proceeded to install the <em>GIMP</em> application. Despite frequent threats by the developers to remove them, the <em>GIMP</em> application had (at time of composition) some obscure and infrequently-used features permitting the creation and manipulation of image files. After its painstaking creation, the file was then transferred between the virtual machine and its host by way of a physical Universal Serial Bus mass-storage device. The mass-storage device was prepared in advance by formatting it with the 32-bit <em>File Allocation Table</em> filesystem and labeling it <em>Charon</em>, in recognition of its role in transporting the soul of the artwork between worlds.</p>

<p>The artist generated this work using the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em>, based on the following description:</p>

<pre><code>set terminal gif size 10,10
set output 'ix.gif'
set margins 0,0,0,0
unset key
unset tics
unset border
unset label
set style rectangle fs border lc rgb 'blue'
set object 1 rectangle from screen 0,0 to screen 1,1 fillcolor rgb 'blue' behind
plot 1 lt rgb 'blue'
</code></pre>

<p>Note in particular how easily a user of the <em>Gnu’s Not Unix Plotter</em> may customize the background color of a plot. The plot description may then be rendered as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$ gnuplot ix.gp 
</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-382" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Lots of applications require a Postgres database. Before you can install them, you will need a Postgres database. How do you pick the right Postgres for your application? There are a bewildering variety of possible ways to acquire a database running on a Postgres instance, but the biggest choice is “build or buy”: whether to install a Postgres version on your own or to purchase it as a service.</p><p>lakeFS is yet another Postgres application, so it requires a Postgres database. At Treeverse we decided for now to buy Postgres as a service. I’ll explain the factors why we decided, and how you might decide to whether or not to follow us.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#got-a-postgres"></a>Got a Postgres?</h2><p>If your organization already runs Postgres instances, they may well be the best choice: there can be extensive in-house experience and expertise already present. And you probably don’t need this guide.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expensive-as-a-service"></a>Expensive as a Service?</h2><p>The most common objection to buying a database as a service is sheer price: a DB instance from your cloud provider can cost more than&nbsp;<em>twice</em>&nbsp;the cost of the virtual machine instance that it runs on. Obviously you pay extra to get much more than just the virtualized resources: you get expertise, much of the ops, easier backup and clustering, sometimes even some features.</p><p>For pricing I believe we should prefer to&nbsp;<em>buy</em>&nbsp;what is not a core part of our business. Pricing can actually make this decision easy. If the cost of buying Postgres as a service is a significant expenditure, then necessarily it is a core part of business — and clearly we need to develop the requisite in-house capability to support it. Otherwise cost is not a driving factor in the decision.</p><p>Even if you decide Postgres is a core capability for your organization, you may wish buy Postgres as a service for an initial ramp-up period, planning to move away later. While migrating database installations generally requires some downtime, this too is often a good choice.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#choices"></a>Choices</h2><p>Every cloud provider provides managed Postgres as a service:</p><ul><li>AWS provide RDS as well as clustered Postgres-compatible Aurora;</li><li>Azure provide Azure Database for PostgreSQL;</li><li>GCP provide Postgres on Cloud SQL</li></ul><p>Similarly, some hosting providers also have a Postgres as a service offering. If you are already using a hosting provider that offers Postgres — Heroku is one example — this can be a convenient choice.</p><p>Postgres maintain a page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_hosting/">PostgreSQL: Hosting Providers</a>&nbsp;that list a wide range of options for purchasing hosted solutions along with support. Additionally, many hosted application platforms offer Postgres.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#expertise-and-ops"></a>Expertise and Ops</h2><p>Developing in-house expertise is often desirable, and not only as a means to save costs. For instance, by allowing rapid resolution of issues without having to go outside the organization, expertise reduces risk.</p><p>On the flip side, managing your in-house database carries an ops burden, which will include monitoring, backup, clustering, and versioning. The last can be particularly troubling: occasionally you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;need to upgrade Postgres on a running system.</p><p>A middle ground between buying a service and building it yourself is to contract the setup but manage ops in-house. I believe that unless you do database-related development, databases are generally a poor fit for this middle ground alternative. Contracting only the setup means you will take longer to build expertise in the database. Meanwhile you already start carrying the ops burden of the database.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions-and-extensions"></a>Versions and Extensions</h2><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#versions"></a>Versions</h3><p>Buying from a large service provider appears to limit available versions. Currently, for example, the latest supported Postgres version is 12.4; the major release Postgres 12 was on 2019-10-03. Service providers have been slow to provide version 12:</p><ul><li>AWS RDS started supporting Postgres version 12 on 2020-03-31, and supports Postgres versions 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10, and 11; however Aurora clusters do not support version 12 yet;</li><li>Azure still supports only versions 9.5, 9.6, 10.11, and 11.6;</li><li>GCP started providing Postgres version 12 on 2020-05-21;</li><li>ElephantSQL supports Postgres version 12, but the free tier provides version 11.9.</li></ul><p>At the same time service providers can upgrade Postgres (and underlying OS) versions more transparently. This can be particularly useful for receiving patch releases. So low availability of newer Postgres versions is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a significant detriment. Of course, certain applications may require an absolutely latest version of Postgres, which may make it impossible to buy Postgres service.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#extensions"></a>Extensions</h3><p>Numerous extensions are available for Postgres. Service providers provide the most popular of these. But they cannot provide all of them, and typically it is not possible to install new extensions that require compilation.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#applicability-to-lakefs"></a>Applicability to lakeFS</h3><p>To allow users flexibility, lakeFS requires only Postgres 11. So availability of versions and extensions does not influence choice of provider for a database intended to run only lakeFS.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#provisioning"></a>Provisioning</h2><p>Creating a new database instance with a service provider requires plenty of time. For example, on AWS RDS creating a small empty database instance can take 10 minutes. This is very reasonable for one-time setup of long-lived production and even staging environments.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#fast-setup-of-small-databases"></a>Fast setup of small databases</h3><p>For short-lived environments or for testing, it can take too long to set up a hosted database. Luckily Postgres is an isolated component and one installation may easily be replaced with another installation. If the database is small and the generated data is not particularly valuable then there are good alternatives with quick setup times. These include creating a new database on an existing Postgres database instance or even — when database instance performance is not critical — running a database instance inside a container. If you have permission to create a new database, both of these alternatives have equivalent setup times that are typically less than a second.</p><p>Using an existing database instance allows you to take advantage of existing setup and ops on that database instance. For example, it will be easy to backup your new database if the database already has backups, and clustering exists at the instance level. By the same token, an existing database instance will offer significantly lower isolation than a container.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>An example of creating new databases inside an existing database instance is the ElephantSQL free tier: you are allocated a database inside an existing instance and can see that other databases exist inside that instance. It uses Postgres roles to prevent data leakage (a side effect is that some operations are impossible, for instance any application that requires multiple roles).</p><p>An example of running a database instance inside a container is when running tests. Every test can create its own blank container running Postgres. This is probably the best solution for component testing: it offers complete isolation between tests, the database container is small, and it scales directly with the number of running tests.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/treeverse/blog-internal/blob/master/20200907-picking-postgres/20200907-picking-postgres.md#what-did-we-pick"></a>What did we pick?</h2><p>All our lakeFS instances currently use plain or Aurora Postgres on RDS:</p><ul><li>Our database usage is currently not high enough to justify the cost savings of running our own instances..</li><li>We build lakeFS, and supporting Postgres as a service is important to the product. So by design, lakeFS does not require latest-version features or esoteric extensions.</li><li>Our core business is currently to develop rather than to operate lakeFS; this is essentially the “ramp-up” time above.</li></ul><p>For isolation and speed of setup, our unit and component testing use a containerized Postgres instance.</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="407" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-768x576.jpg 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-2048x1535.jpg 2048w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-24x18.jpg 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-36x27.jpg 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/img_20200904_234025-48x36.jpg 48w"><figcaption>Picking a database, like picking an elephant, can be hard but need not be intimidating</figcaption></figure></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

<p>For healthy software ecosystems, open standards aren't
enough. They need to have low barriers to implementation.</p>

<p>High complexity barriers squeeze out alternative
implementations. They make make it harder to compete
or provide alternatives to users.</p>

<p>The inevitable result of this is that only a small
number of well funded implementations survive. And
those implementations need to be part of a larger
monetization strategy. If they're not, the costs
that go into developing them can't be justified
to the people writing the checks.</p>

<p>And the problems compound. As implementers drop off
the standard, it becomes easier for large, well funded
players to add more complexity, which raises larger
competitive barriers. There are fewer left to object.</p>

<p>This is the equivalent of regulatory capture, but
for technology.</p>

<p>Browsers are a cautionary tale.</p>

<p>Today, there are approximately two sources of
funding for browsers: Apple, and Google. While
the people working on Netsurf are doing hero's
work, the chance of them ever catching up with
the rapid explosion of complexity in browsers
is slim. Webassembly, replacing TCP, WebGL, and
thousands of other APIs have given the megacorps
a way of keeping up-and-comers out of their
playgrounds.</p>

<p>But the underlying problems apply elsewhere.
From email, to network protocols, to deployemnt
tools, complexity can grant ownership, even when
the standards are open.</p>

<p>ps: Yes, I am aware of the irony of posting
this on the internet. At least the page is simple
enough that even mothra can render it.</p>

6 minute read
</p>
<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>I read a post online recently about how some software engineer was asked to complete a technically complex, jargon-filled coding challenge over the phone in order to get a job. He did well enough on the call to get an offer, but after he started the new job, he realized it wasn’t going to be the academically challenging role he was hoping for. No, he’d just be building basic CRUD applications for the web with a legacy system haphazardly running on whatever virtual machine could be found.</p>
<p>This happens all the time during job-screening. We put engineers through rigorous screening processes and ask them intellectually stimulating questions, only to hire them and put them into the admittedly dull task of wiring up 5 or 6 services and making the screen look pretty. I’m not saying there aren’t skills involved in those tasks - I’m simply saying that those aren’t the same skills being tested for in most whiteboarding-style challenges.</p>
<p><em>PS: <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring">Here’s how I revamped my hiring process with this trend in mind</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="lets-stop-sugar-coating-it">Let’s stop sugar-coating it</h2>
<p><strong>Software is created when its presence provides more business value than its absence.</strong></p>
<p>While it’s appealing to read about software craftsmanship and strive for excellence in everything we do, when it really comes down to it, our job wouldn’t exist if we didn’t make money (or save money) for some business somewhere.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the industry’s state makes sense. Just like plumbers, <strong>we are paid to know our tools and understand how they work together to make a usable piece of equipment</strong>, not to reinvent working technology or spend 80 hours optimizing something that 5% of our users will use.</p>
<h2 id="put-it-in-perspective">Put it in perspective</h2>
<p>Small to medium sized businesses rarely deal with scaling or optimization problems anymore - partly because hardware has gotten so cheap, and partly because foundational open source software has gotten so good. This is a great thing, and we as software developers should embrace it.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the plumbing example. Imagine you owned a small restaurant with one bathroom and 10 employees. You get a few hundred customers per week and maybe 10% of them use your bathroom. Obviously, you’ve got to have a working bathroom, but does it need to be anything fancier or more advanced than your home toilet? <strong>Do you need 10 stalls, motion-activated faucets, Dyson hand dryers, and marble counters?</strong> Probably not, unless you’re just trying to project some facade of success.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9bS3JGQ.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>We do this all the time in the world of <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/roles-of-startup-cto">startup software engineering</a> though.</strong></p>
<p>A small business with 5-10 employees building a software-as-a-service web app needs to have a reliable, secure system, but does it need to be that much more robust than an off-the-shelf service provides? <strong>Do you really need AI-powered search, real-time dashboards for every internal team member, microsecond optimizations on your home page, and split testing for every feature you release?</strong> Probably not unless you’re just trying to project a facade of success…</p>
<p>Just as a good small business owner should hire a humble plumber who knows the standard tools required for small bathrooms, and will pay him market rate, <strong>a good engineering manager should hire <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hero-myth">humble team players</a> who use industry-standard tools to build reliable software, and pay them market rate.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, what I’m seeing is a lot of false projections from engineering managers. They give the impression during the interview that every person they hire must be a senior engineer, has to have “big data” experience, or has to know every sorting algorithm by heart.</p>
<h2 id="we-engineers-are-guilty-of-over-engineering">We (engineers) are guilty of over-engineering</h2>
<p>Part of the problem is that we over-engineer the software we work on. I am guilty of this as well.</p>
<p>I came to the Graide Network and immediately started breaking our legacy app into microservices. Now I’ve had to build custom tooling just to help new developers get things running on their local machines - not something that is truly worth my time this early on in our business’ lifecycle.</p>
<p>I’ve also made it harder on myself to hire people. I don’t want to limit my hiring pool to engineers who know multiple specific web frameworks, Docker containers, microservices, Redis, and MySQL, but I’ve built myself into a corner with all these choices. Lately I’ve realized this, and been starting to think of ways to simplify our stack, but that will have to come in a future blog post.</p>
<h2 id="investors-are-guilty-of-pushing-it-on-us">Investors are guilty of pushing it on us</h2>
<p>The other side is investor and media pressure. In the startup world this is especially pronounced as I’ve found investors as likely to latch onto buzzwords as reporters are.</p>
<p>“Oh, so you’re building an app? Does it use AI? Blockchain? <insert hot="" buzzy="" tech="" here="">? Take my money and do it!"</insert></p>
<p>Now you’ve sold yourself to an investor as an AI/Blockchain/etc. company, so you’ve got to hire engineers who do that thing, even if you’re not sure it’s actually going to help you build a better business or not. This means you’re going to shun candidates with 10+ years of experience in existing tech to hire slick kids who jump from buzz-word to buzz-word chasing trends. <strong>It’s like hiring a plumber with 3 years of experience who invented his own tools: high risk, very low reward.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-do-about-it">What do we do about it?</h2>
<p>So we’re here, living in a world where most “software engineering” is essentially plumbing. What should we do about it? What does it mean for our careers? Will the money keep flowing forever?</p>
<p><strong>First, we should recognize and embrace the fact that we can build more with less.</strong> What it will mean is that the crummy parts of our job will probably get automated or tools will be built that will make it possible for business people to do them for us. For example, I used to have to make code changes every time someone on our team wanted to change an automated email’s copy. Now, they just have to edit a template in Sendgrid’s nice visual editor, and I never even know that a change has been made.</p>
<p><strong>Second, we should consider the complexity required when designing systems.</strong> If an off-the-shelf solution exists, grab it, don’t build it from scratch. Get good at soldering pieces together so that you seem more productive, faster, and better at your job than the software artisans out there who have to custom-build their own framework every time they start a project.</p>
<p><strong>Third, we should set realistic expectations in our job listings.</strong> No more coding exercises that require a CS degree for jobs that require little more than importing libraries and understanding HTTP requests. Yes, some jobs will require micro-optimizations, and that’s fine, but recognize that those are few and far between. Your software is likely not as special as you think it is.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/code-notenough-karl-l-hughes/">don’t get comfortable</a>.</strong> This isn’t a popular opinion among software engineers, but I believe that many in the field are overpaid relative to the difficulty of the work they do. Sometimes it’s because they are the only people who know some obscure corner of their field, sometimes it’s because their company’s gatekeepers are preventing full access to the talent market, and sometimes it’s because other engineers insisted they overbuild things such that junior devs will take a long time to understand it. In any case, <strong>we can’t stop learning if we want to remain relevant and well-paid.</strong> Keep going deep and wide in your knowledge, and learn how to filter out the hype from the truly ground-breaking technology.</p>
<p>What do you think? I imagine many of you in the field will have a different opinion, so let me hear it on <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

But hold on. The argument for taking Vitamin D assumes a few things. First, that low Vitamin D actually causes all of the conditions it is associated with. This is not necessarily true. Low Vitamin D could cause (or contribute to) heart disease, but it could also be that heart disease causes low Vitamin D. Another possibility is that some third factor causes both low Vitamin D and heart disease. </p><p id="viewer-9g65f">Even if we can prove some causation, we then need to assume that correcting the Vitamin D deficiency will prevent the disease. This may not be true either. Low Vitamin D may be an indicator of overall poor health, which increases the risk for cardiac disease. It could appear that low Vitamin D contributes to the condition. But raising the Vitamin D will not help because it will just fix the symptom, not the underlying problem. </p><h3 id="viewer-399rj"><strong>Randomized Controlled Trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-4p68a">Fortunately we have studies that can help figure this out. Currently the best way to answer a question of clinical relevance is with a large, well-executed <strong>randomized controlled trial (RCT).</strong> An RCT works like this: enroll the participants you want to study and randomly assign half of them to receive a treatment and the other half to receive a placebo. Those receiving the treatment are called the intervention group. The other group is the control group. Ideally, the two groups will be similar in every way except the treatment – they will have the same distribution in age, income, race, gender, and health status. They will even receive pills that look identical, though half will be placebos. If, at the end of the study, there are differences between the two groups, we can attribute those differences to the treatment. </p><div id="viewer-3aoj5"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Simple randomized controlled trial "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1674,h_920,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_70919e7b7a7d480c815f451bdce6cb09~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Simple randomized controlled trial "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Simple randomized controlled trial</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-fvrr">RCTs are costly and time intensive, so generally we will only be able to study the interventions and outcomes that have the highest chance of showing a benefit. We base this on prior studies; if several large observational studies show a correlation between Vitamin D and heart disease, then this is something we should study with an RCT. </p><p id="viewer-1ofc5">
We now have results for over 1500 RCTs on Vitamin D supplementation. Some of the largest and most significant trials are listed and summarized at the end of this article. When tested on its ability to prevent disease, <strong>Vitamin D has failed to live up to expectations</strong>. </p><div id="viewer-b7fav"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Results of Vitamin D Trials "><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1206,h_878,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_a25ba8bbf26b47a096d2dc2ee7e41fcd~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png" alt="Results of Vitamin D Trials "></p></div><p><span dir="auto">For more details, see the list of high-quality RCTs at the bottom of this page</span></p></div></div></div><p id="viewer-en75e">One of the largest and best studies we have is called <a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>VITAL</u></a>, led by Dr. JoAnn Manson at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Over 25,000 adults (men age 50 and older, women age 55 and older) with no history of cardiovascular disease or cancer participated in the study. They received either 2,000 IUs of Vitamin D3 or placebo daily for five years. Researchers evaluated the rates of cancer and major cardiovascular events including stroke, heart attack, and cardiovascular death. </p><p id="viewer-f6k24"><strong>The result: Vitamin D failed to prevent cancer, stroke, heart attack, or cardiovascular death. </strong>These conditions occurred at the same rate in those receiving Vitamin D and those receiving placebo. There was one positive finding, though: in a post hoc analysis, it seemed that Vitamin D decreased the mortality from cancer when the initial two years were excluded. Post hoc (“after the event”) analyses can be quite useful, but need to be viewed with some skepticism. In high-quality RCTs (like VITAL), the outcome measures and statistical analyses are specified prior to data collection. Sometimes, as in VITAL’s case, an unexpected outcome may appear at the time the data are evaluated, prompting a post hoc analysis. In this case, when results from the first two years were excluded, the rate of cancer death was 1.2% in the placebo group, and 0.9% in the Vitamin D group - 25% reduction in cancer mortality, though the absolute numbers were low. It is not possible to draw too many conclusions from this, but it is something to note for future studies. </p><p id="viewer-3cooc"><strong>Even in studies of bone health, Vitamin D has been disappointing.</strong> We already know that Vitamin D is essential in calcium metabolism, and Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders like rickets and osteomalacia. Taking Vitamin D to treat severe Vitamin D deficiency is necessary for the treatment of these conditions. But in the large trials looking at Vitamin D's ability to prevent bone loss, the participants were taken from the general population, many of whom had normal Vitamin D levels. For severely deficient individuals (only a small percentage of the population), there are clear benefits to supplementation. These benefits do not appear to extend to those with normal levels or mild deficiencies.</p><h3 id="viewer-ct6r5"><strong>Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials</strong></h3><p id="viewer-ek5t0">Large randomized controlled trials are currently the best way to evaluate a treatment, but they are difficult to do. If done well, an RCT is expensive, time intensive, and challenging to coordinate. It is worth it if we can answer our question adequately, but sometimes we realize after the trial that we needed to account for something else, or that we need more people in the study before we can really answer our question. In addition, RCTs will not always give definitive answers. Sometimes two or more small trials of the same treatment will show opposite results, and we need to reconcile those. Simply redoing an RCT is usually not an option. Instead, scientists have developed a method of combining similar RCTs and analyzing them together, in what is called a meta-analysis. </p><p id="viewer-ab05u">Meta-analyses have exploded in popularity over the last few decades.<span> If done well, a meta-analysis of a group of trials can reveal insights that cannot be seen in the individual trials. Unfortunately there are potential problems. The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality of the studies it includes, which can lead to erroneous results when poor quality studies are present (garbage in, garbage out).</span></p><p id="viewer-9nlvf"><span>In addition, <strong>publication bias</strong> may incorrectly amplify a treatment effect. Publication bias occurs when researchers decide to publish only “positive” findings – studies that show a treatment effect. Suppose ten small trials of Vitamin D are performed. Five show a benefit to Vitamin D and five do not. Researchers and journals are much more inclined to publish positive results than negative, so it is possible that only the five positive studies will make it into the medical literature. A meta-analysis on the five published positive studies will show a much stronger effect of Vitamin D than a meta-analysis that included all ten studies. </span></p><div id="viewer-9ul9t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.devaboone.com/post/vitamin-d-part-3-the-evidence" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_900,h_373,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3e0600_1afb8b809c0446029010b53b0b7cdf14~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a6n1n"> <em>Where negative studies go to die. </em></p><p id="viewer-a6bj6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rosenthal_(psychologist)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>Robert Rosenthal </u></em></a><em>called publication bias "the file drawer problem" because important negative studies often end up here.

One of the major challenges in performing these analyses is deciding which studies to include or exclude. Ideally only high-quality, well-designed, well-executed studies will be included. Researchers do not always agree on which studies to include, and differences in inclusion criteria have led to similar meta-analyses producing opposite results. </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115934" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>This has occurred</u></a> <span>in studies of Vitamin D and fracture risk in older adults, with some meta-analyses showing zero benefit to Vitamin D and others showing a decreased risk of fracture, even though they included many of the same studies. </span></p><p id="viewer-donuf"><span>In addition to being high quality, the included studies should all try to answer the same clinical question. Many meta-analyses can only be done by combining trials that differ in important details, like the age of participants, treatment dosages, or definition of endpoints. Combining these may be feasible, but the clinical relevance may change when disparate groups are lumped together. For example, suppose we want to know if Vitamin D prevents asthma attacks in children. If a meta-analysis shows a small benefit to Vitamin D when all ages are combined, but the individual small studies in children did not show a benefit, what do I advise a 10 year old with asthma?</span></p><p id="viewer-9le66">Despite these challenges, meta-analyses of RCTs can provide meaningful insights. Unfortunately, most high-quality meta-analyses show similar results to our individual randomized controlled trials: <strong>Vitamin D does not appear to prevent disease in healthy adults.</strong> </p><p id="viewer-9hssp">But there are a few promising areas identified in meta-analyses. Note that some of these findings are not consistent with the large RCTs and will need to be studied further before definitive recommendations can be made. </p><p id="viewer-25ike">The areas in which meta-analyses have identified benefits from Vitamin D:</p><ol><li id="viewer-f3qjq"><p><strong>Fracture prevention in elderly nursing home residents </strong>(when also given with calcium):   This is not surprising. We know that Vitamin D and calcium can prevent bone loss in severe Vitamin D deficiency. Elderly adults who are not getting outside are more likely to be severely deficient in Vitamin D, and supplements likely help.</p></li><li id="viewer-fa0a9"><p><strong>Asthma and respiratory infection</strong>: Vitamin D seems to reduce asthma attacks in adults with mild to moderate disease, and daily or weekly Vitamin D seems to prevent acute respiratory infection in those with Vitamin D less than 10 ng/ml (25 nmol/l). There is considerable excitement around Vitamin D's potential role in Covid treatment, though we do not yet have enough evidence to make a definitive conclusion. </p></li><li id="viewer-d7fj2"><p><strong>Cancer mortality</strong>: Vitamin D does not appear to prevent cancer, but may reduce death rates from cancer overall (when all cancers are combined) when Vitamin D is taken for several years. It is not known whether Vitamin D itself fights cancer. It could also be that individuals with cancer are more prone to developing severe Vitamin D deficiency, which leads to bone loss, fragility, and fractures, which increase mortality.</p></li><li id="viewer-cvias"><p><strong>Atopic dermatitis (eczema)</strong>: Vitamin D …</p></li></ol></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44719608-refactoring"><em>Refactoring</em></a> and two things have gotten my gears turning.</p>



<p><strong>Thing one: refactoring moves understanding from your head back into your code.</strong> When you finally grok how something is working, refactor the code to make that understanding obvious.</p>



<blockquote><p>Read the code, gain some insight, and use refactoring to move that insight from your head back into the code. The clearer code then makes it easier to understand it, leading to deeper insights and a beneficial positive feedback loop.</p><cite>Martin Fowler</cite></blockquote>



<p>For example, if you realize that a chunk of code is determining the pricing for a soccer match, extract that into a <code>determinePrice()</code> function so that next time it’ll be obvious. </p>



<p>Or if discover two different types of Articles (Text and Video), make <code>TextArticle</code> and <code>VideoArticle</code> classes that extend the <code>Article</code> class. That way, no one will ever need to learn that lesson the hard way again.</p>



<p>Whenever you think “ah, so <em>that’s</em> what this is doing” use that as a mental trigger that you should refactor to make it self evident.</p>



<p>It’s embarrassing how obvious this seems in retrospect. I’ve used that as a trigger to write documentation or do some knowledge sharing, rather than improve the code.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Thing two: refactoring should be done in tiny steps, and the code should never be in a broken state.</strong> You make a little change, compile-test-commit, and repeat. The changes will be small, but they add up.</p>



<blockquote><p>Whenever I’ve shown people how I refactor, they are surprised by how small my steps are, each step leaving the code in a working state that compiles and passes its tests. The key to effective refactoring is recognizing that you go faster when you take tiny steps, the code is never broken, and you can compose those small steps into substantial changes.</p><cite>Martin Fowler</cite></blockquote>



<p>I never realized that I could change so much without breaking stuff in the process. I always assumed refactoring was the code equivalent of cracking eggs to make an omelette. </p>



<p>Last week, I spent a couple hours moving code around and creating classes and changing method definitions. Then I spent the next 4 hours trying to make it all work again. Oh how I wish I had read this book before that.</p>



<p>Important note: this depends on having solid and fast automated tests. <em>Writing tests is often the first step of refactoring.</em> Remember, you should compile-test-commit after each change. That’s going to be brutal if you can’t make robots do your testing for you. </p>



<p>I’m not even halfway through <em>Refactoring</em> but so far it’s fantastic. Have you read it? What did you think? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet me</a> and let me know. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I use clipboard a lot when I work with images or screenshots. It allows me to upload or transfer images that are not on my disk. For example, I can copy an image from a graphics editor to browsers, messengers, and other applications. This approach keeps my Downloads folder clean and sane.</p><p>I always thought that when you paste an image to a browser, it's content stays the same. It's not. As it turned out, when you copy a JPG image to Chrome, it converts it to PNG.</p><p>This is super bad for the web because your 400KB JPG can become a <strong>2.5MB</strong> PNG file. Many content creators paste their images to WYSIWYG editors, and they don't notice changes in file sizes. Online image editors have no other choice other than working with converted files too.</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/clipboard/api.jpg" width="600"></p><h2>Browsers and Clipboard API</h2><p>I've tested clipboard on all major browsers, and they behave differently. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/clipboard-apis/#reading-from-clipboard">W3C Clipboard API specification</a> allows browsers to interact with PNG, JPG, GIF, and SVG images.</p><p>Every operating system supports a lot of clipboard formats. For our experiment, we are interested in two general categories:</p><ol><li><p><strong>File object clipboard</strong> — When you copy a file from a system file manager, the clipboard only contains meta-information, such as name and path. The receiver of a copy is responsible for reading it from the filesystem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data clipboard</strong> — A copy of the object itself. It can be binary or text data. Usually, such a clipboard format is used when you exchange your data between applications.</p></li></ol><p>I've tested it on macOS only. To view current clipboard content in macOS, you can run the following command:</p><div><pre><span></span><code>$ osascript -e <span>'the clipboard as record'</span>
</code></pre></div><p><br> <strong>Chrome 85</strong> converts JPG to PNG but keeps SVG and GIF files as-is. It also supports the file object clipboard.</p><p><strong>Firefox 80</strong> does not support file object clipboard (you can't copy and paste an image from the file manager) and converts JPEG to PNG when pasting from other applications.</p><p><strong>Safari 13</strong> does not modify JPG files, allows any image formats, and works with both binary and file clipboards.</p><p>This result surprised me. When it comes to relatively new features, Safari is the one that lags behind Chrome and Firefox. You can use <a href="https://evercoder.github.io/clipboard-inspector/">Clipboard &amp; Drop Inspector</a> to test it on your data and operating system.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599532527250/Gm0E0xbTo.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>The most successful companies are built upon great working cultures that are thoughtful about the <a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-new-analytics-of-culture">cultural contribution</a> each hire will make to their company. If you're a candidate looking to land your dream job, you'll need to be well prepared for these cultural or behavioral interviews. </p>
<p>As a hiring manager, I've interviewed over 200 engineering candidates and a significant portion of that  has been evaluating the soft skills each candidate embodies. I've rejected extremely strong technical performers and and fought to hire some more junior candidates based on the signal I've identified from the culture interview. Because every company has their own culture, their own values, and their own questions, the culture interview can be extremely hard to prepare for. However, there's still plenty you can do to set yourself up for success instead of jumping in blind.</p>
<p>While my interviewing experience as both a hiring manager and a candidate have been primarily within engineering, I believe the tools in this kit will be mostly applicable across product, design, and other disciplines within product development organizations. </p>
<h2 id="stories-to-prepare">Stories to Prepare</h2>
<p>Why should you prepare stories instead of answers to specific questions? The simple reason is that you can't prepare and memorize an answer to every question an interviewer might ask. Often times these conversations are organic and the real signal comes from how you respond to follow-up questions. The best answers are rooted in real examples from your personal experience and by "loading" these stories into your brain ahead of time, you'll be better equipped to handle questions on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="story-1-your-career-narrative">Story #1: Your career narrative</h3>
<p>Almost everyone you talk to will give an intro of themselves and then ask you to share a brief intro as well. Depending on who you're talking to, that intro can be anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. In some cases, a hiring manager or recruiter might ask you to go deeper into your background and spend up to 30 minutes digging into your experiences.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ol>
<li>A narrative that connects your career together. While many careers are not linear, it can help to show that you were deliberate about the jobs you took and what you wanted to learn at each one. You may find that as you look back on your career, there's a story you can weave together that ties together where you started, where you're at now, and the trajectory you're on. A story that shows strong growth, surmounting challenges, and a high forward trajectory can help get companies excited about you. Finish your story such that the company you're talking to easily makes sense as the next step on your career journey.<ul>
<li>A weak narrative merely lists what's on your resume, e.g., "in 2013 I joined X and did these projects, in 2014 I joined Y and did these projects, and recently I've done Z and B. I want to join this company because it's doing really well."</li>
<li>A stronger narrative gives context on your decisions and motivations, e.g., "In college, I was excited about electronics and human-computer interfaces, so I looked for companies that specialized in consumer hardware. X company was one of the companies that stood out, and when I joined I got to work on the interface for Product P. This taught me [so and so] but after 2 years there, I really wanted to get better at [this other thing], so I reached out to Company Y. From there, I grew into [some role], helped the company do [these things], and now I'm [doing something impressive]. Going forward, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can put my front end architecture skills to good use while learning how to build complex systems at scale. I admire [company name] for being able to build high quality user interfaces while being super fast and reliable. I think this might be a great fit for my expertise and give me opportunities to grow my backend skills."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What specific things you're looking for in your next role. These should apply to more than one company to show that you're not just pandering to the company, but try to be opinionated at the same time.<ul>
<li>A weak answer is too vague, uncertain, or demonstrates that you haven't put much thought to it.<ul>
<li>e.g., "I'm looking for a place where I can advance my career." or "I wanted to get into AI and Machine Learning because it's a really hot industry right now."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A stronger answer shows that you've clearly thought about what you want, have had enough experience to know what you don't want, and implicitly show why the company you're talking to is a good fit.<ul>
<li>e.g., "Over my career, I've found that it's really important for me to have a strong sense of ownership over my work. I enjoy taking an ambiguous customer problem, breaking it down with a PM or designer, and then being able to see the whole project through from start to finish. I like to solve problems and not just execute on tasks, even if that means working through some dealing with a lot of uncertainty at times and wearing many hats."</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-the-interviewer-is-looking-for">What the interviewer is looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>For quick intros, interviewers are generally not evaluating your storytelling ability. Instead, they want to know why you might be a good fit for the role and what your motivations are.</li>
<li>For hiring managers and recruiters, your career narrative can be a useful lens to interpret the interview feedback and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.<ul>
<li>For example, if your background is primarily backend engineering and the interviews demonstrate weakness in UI implementation, then your narrative can help interviewers focus more on your strengths over your weaker areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you under-represent yourself at this stage, you may miss an opportunity to move forward in the interview process or get an offer.<ul>
<li>On the flip side, you should avoid changing your narrative too much simply to suit the role or company you're talking to. It's often better to be rejected for a role that really doesn't fit you than to get a role doing something that doesn't actually align with what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li>What are you looking for in your next role?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in [company]?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-2-two-impressive-projects">Story #2: Two Impressive Projects</h3>
<p>You should be prepared to talk in depth about at least two meaningful projects you've worked on where you played a significant role. Why two? If you use the same example for every question, the interviewer may think you're lacking experience or have a weak track record. Having at least two substantial projects in your pocket will help you balance breadth and depth to respond to a variety of questions.</p>
<p>Keep your initial explanation short (between 3-5 minutes) and offer to go deeper afterwards. This will help keep the conversation focused and avoid wasting time on unimportant details.</p>
<p>A good format to use whenever you're giving an example of something that happened is to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm">SBI framework</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf">STAR framework</a>. For these examples I'll use the SBI model. </p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation</strong>: Share context on the project before jumping into what you did.<ul>
<li>Where did the project come from?</li>
<li>Why was it important? How did you or your team prioritize it?</li>
<li>What were the goals of the project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong>: Describe your specific role on that project. If you played a technical role, describe how the system was designed.<ul>
<li>Project management<ul>
<li>What was your role in defining the scope or solution?</li>
<li>How did you ensure the project was on track?</li>
<li>What obstacles came up during the project? How did you overcome them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>System design of the project<ul>
<li>How was the system architected?</li>
<li>What were the biggest points of failure?</li>
<li>How did you approach this design?</li>
<li>Who else was involved in the design?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impact</strong>: What was the result of this project?<ul>
<li>What went well on that project?<ul>
<li>Did the project succeed?</li>
<li>How did you measure success?</li>
<li>Can you share some of your success metrics and how they performed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What did you learn on that project?<ul>
<li>What skills did you build?</li>
<li>What didn't go well on that project?</li>
<li>If you were to do the project again, what might you do differently? Try to come up with at least one or two examples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the project didn't succeed, why not?<ul>
<li>Demonstrate that you can take ownership of your mistakes and avoid blaming others. Most interviewers are looking for a growth mindset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-interviewers-are-looking-for">What interviewers are looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does the work align with the level and scope of the role?<ul>
<li>Are they applying for a role that's realistic with what they've done historically?</li>
<li>What kind of domain expertise do they have?</li>
<li>Have they had enough technical leadership experience for the role? (More relevant for senior/tech lead roles and above.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can the candidate clearly articulate the benefit and impact of their work?<ul>
<li>It's surprising how often some people don't know or think about the result of their work beyond completing the tasks that were assigned to them. Strong candidates think about the entire workflow, from idea conception to evaluating success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do they have a growth mindset?<ul>
<li>Are they able to reflect on both the successes and misses of that project?</li>
<li>Do they take credit for all the things that went well and blame others for all the things that didn't go well? (This would be a red flag.)</li>
<li>Can they clearly explain both the technical and non-technical portions of their work?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>What's the most significant project you worked on in the last year?</li>
<li>Tell me about a project that didn't go as well as you had hoped. What happened?</li>
<li>Give me an example of how you learned an area/product that you knew nothing about. What was the outcome?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599089660735/RwoSL0oEm.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599089660735/RwoSL0oEm.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-3-resolving-a-conflict">Story #3: Resolving a conflict</h3>
<p>Delivering successful projects often require working with a lot of stakeholders and collaborators. Demonstrate that you can work well with others, share critical feedback, and resolve situations on your own.</p>
<p>I've been surprised at how often candidates talk about a situation where they ultimately failed to resolve a conflict. It can be hard to think of a good example on the spot, so definitely prepare this ahead of time and consider what you want the interviewer to take away.</p>

<p>While it should come as no surprise to those who are following the rumors, Peloton has <a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/new-peloton-bike-tread/">announced</a> a new bike (Bike+) and a new lower-cost treadmill.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="An Inside Look at the Peloton Bike+" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-W5ffw24HSQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<blockquote><p>The Peloton Bike+ is the bike our Members helped build, designed to make it even easier to complement an indoor cycling class with Peloton’s strength, yoga, stretching and meditation classes, all streaming right on the Bike+. We’ve incorporated some of the most-requested hardware and software features Members told us they’d love to see, including a&nbsp;<strong>23.8” rotating HD touchscreen</strong>&nbsp;which rotates 180 degrees left and right for easy viewing when you’re off the Bike. Other new features include a&nbsp;<strong>high-fidelity four-speaker sound system</strong>&nbsp;so instructor cues and killer playlists come through loud and clear; a one-tap integration with&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://connectthewatts.com/2020/09/05/comment-apple-watch-integration-for-peloton-would-be-a-win-win-for-both-companies/">Apple Gymkit</a>™</strong>&nbsp;so you can pair your Apple Watch® with the Bike+ to keep your metrics in sync; and the<strong>&nbsp;Auto-Follow digital resistance system</strong>&nbsp;that automatically remembers your&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/our-newest-peloton-features-will-make-your-workouts-even-better/#:~:text=Target%20Metrics%3A%20Bike&amp;text=Once%20you're%20riding%2C%20if,class%20available%20on%20the%20Bike.">Target Metrics</a>&nbsp;and scales your resistance up and down based on instructor guidance, allowing you to fully lose yourself in the class.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>The original bike will remain for sale, but with a lower price of $1,895 with payments as low as $49 per month if financing. Bike Bootcamp classes will be available beginning on 9/15 taught by Robin Arzón,  Jess Sims, and Cody Rigsby.</p>



<p>If you have the existing bike, you can trade it in (US only) for $700 off the new Bike plus receive a free Yoga &amp; Toning accessories set. If you’re still within your 30 day home trial, Peloton will be refunding $350 off the purchase.</p>

<p>Also tracking with rumors, Peloton has announced a new lower-cost treadmill as well. According to Peloton, it measures smaller than most couches at 68” L x 33” W x 62” H. It’s coming in early 2021 for $2,495 in the US and Canada. In the UK, it will be available on December 26th, 2020. Visit Peloton’s <a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/new-peloton-bike-tread/">official announcement</a> for all the details. The original treadmill remains for sale and is now called Tread+.</p>



<h2>Connect The Watts Take</h2>



<p>While much of what was announced was already known, it’s exciting to see Bike+ and the treadmill in action. Of all the new features of the Bike+, the digital resistance system is the one that interests me the most. The video discusses how it works, but in short, it can follow your target metrics and increase/decrease based on what the instructor calls for in the class.</p>



<p>The key metric for Peloton will not be how many they sell, but how many they can actually deliver to customers. Peloton’s number one problem of 2020 has been meeting the demand for its products, and additional ones will certainly create excitement.</p>



<p>Are you planning to upgrade to the new bike? Are you planning to trade yours in or sell locally?</p>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>From Jerome K. Jerome’s ‘The Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow’, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idle_Thoughts_of_an_Idle_Fellow">first published in 1886</a>.
Freely available on <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/849">Project Gutenberg</a>.</em></p>

<p>All great literary men are shy. I am myself, though I am told it is hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>I am glad it is not. It used to be extremely prominent at one time, and was the cause of much misery to myself and discomfort to every one about me—my lady friends especially complained most bitterly about it.</p>

<p>A shy man’s lot is not a happy one. The men dislike him, the women despise him, and he dislikes and despises himself. Use brings him no relief, and there is no cure for him except time; though I once came across a delicious recipe for overcoming the misfortune. It appeared among the “answers to correspondents” in a small weekly journal and ran as follows—I have never forgotten it: “Adopt an easy and pleasing manner, especially toward ladies.”</p>

<p>Poor wretch! I can imagine the grin with which he must have read that advice. “Adopt an easy and pleasing manner, especially toward ladies,” forsooth! Don’t you adopt anything of the kind, my dear young shy friend. Your attempt to put on any other disposition than your own will infallibly result in your becoming ridiculously gushing and offensively familiar. Be your own natural self, and then you will only be thought to be surly and stupid.</p>

<p>The shy man does have some slight revenge upon society for the torture it inflicts upon him. He is able, to a certain extent, to communicate his misery. He frightens other people as much as they frighten him. He acts like a damper upon the whole room, and the most jovial spirits become in his presence depressed and nervous.</p>

<p>This is a good deal brought about by misunderstanding. Many people mistake the shy man’s timidity for overbearing arrogance and are awed and insulted by it. His awkwardness is resented as insolent carelessness, and when, terror-stricken at the first word addressed to him, the blood rushes to his head and the power of speech completely fails him, he is regarded as an awful example of the evil effects of giving way to passion.</p>

<p>But, indeed, to be misunderstood is the shy man’s fate on every occasion; and whatever impression he endeavors to create, he is sure to convey its opposite. When he makes a joke, it is looked upon as a pretended relation of fact and his want of veracity much condemned. His sarcasm is accepted as his literal opinion and gains for him the reputation of being an ass, while if, on the other hand, wishing to ingratiate himself, he ventures upon a little bit of flattery, it is taken for satire and he is hated ever afterward.</p>

<p>These and the rest of a shy man’s troubles are always very amusing to other people, and have afforded material for comic writing from time immemorial. But if we look a little deeper we shall find there is a pathetic, one might almost say a tragic, side to the picture. A shy man means a lonely man—a man cut off from all companionship, all sociability. He moves about the world, but does not mix with it. Between him and his fellow-men there runs ever an impassable barrier—a strong, invisible wall that, trying in vain to scale, he but bruises himself against. He sees the pleasant faces and hears the pleasant voices on the other side, but he cannot stretch his hand across to grasp another hand. He stands watching the merry groups, and he longs to speak and to claim kindred with them. But they pass him by, chatting gayly to one another, and he cannot stay them. He tries to reach them, but his prison walls move with him and hem him in on every side. In the busy street, in the crowded room, in the grind of work, in the whirl of pleasure, amid the many or amid the few—wherever men congregate together, wherever the music of human speech is heard and human thought is flashed from human eyes, there, shunned and solitary, the shy man, like a leper, stands apart. His soul is full of love and longing, but the world knows it not. The iron mask of shyness is riveted before his face, and the man beneath is never seen. Genial words and hearty greetings are ever rising to his lips, but they die away in unheard whispers behind the steel clamps. His heart aches for the weary brother, but his sympathy is dumb. Contempt and indignation against wrong choke up his throat, and finding no safety-valve whence in passionate utterance they may burst forth, they only turn in again and harm him. All the hate and scorn and love of a deep nature such as the shy man is ever cursed by fester and corrupt within, instead of spending themselves abroad, and sour him into a misanthrope and cynic.</p>

<p>Yes, shy men, like ugly women, have a bad time of it in this world, to go through which with any comfort needs the hide of a rhinoceros. Thick skin is, indeed, our moral clothes, and without it we are not fit to be seen about in civilized society. A poor gasping, blushing creature, with trembling knees and twitching hands, is a painful sight to every one, and if it cannot cure itself, the sooner it goes and hangs itself the better.</p>

<p>The disease can be cured. For the comfort of the shy, I can assure them of that from personal experience. I do not like speaking about myself, as may have been noticed, but in the cause of humanity I on this occasion will do so, and will confess that at one time I was, as the young man in the Bab Ballad says, “the shyest of the shy,” and “whenever I was introduced to any pretty maid, my knees they knocked together just as if I was afraid.” Now, I would—nay, have—on this very day before yesterday I did the deed. Alone and entirely by myself (as the school-boy said in translating the “Bellum Gallicum”) did I beard a railway refreshment-room young lady in her own lair. I rebuked her in terms of mingled bitterness and sorrow for her callousness and want of condescension. I insisted, courteously but firmly, on being accorded that deference and attention that was the right of the traveling Briton, and at the end I looked her full in the face. Need I say more?</p>

<p>True, immediately after doing so I left the room with what may possibly have appeared to be precipitation and without waiting for any refreshment. But that was because I had changed my mind, not because I was frightened, you understand.</p>

<p>One consolation that shy folk can take unto themselves is that shyness is certainly no sign of stupidity. It is easy enough for bull-headed clowns to sneer at nerves, but the highest natures are not necessarily those containing the greatest amount of moral brass. The horse is not an inferior animal to the cock-sparrow, nor the deer of the forest to the pig. Shyness simply means extreme sensibility, and has nothing whatever to do with self-consciousness or with conceit, though its relationship to both is continually insisted upon by the poll-parrot school of philosophy.</p>

<p>Conceit, indeed, is the quickest cure for it. When it once begins to dawn upon you that you are a good deal cleverer than any one else in this world, bashfulness becomes shocked and leaves you. When you can look round a roomful of people and think that each one is a mere child in intellect compared with yourself you feel no more shy of them than you would of a select company of magpies or orang-outangs.</p>

<p>Conceit is the finest armor that a man can wear. Upon its smooth, impenetrable surface the puny dagger-thrusts of spite and envy glance harmlessly aside. Without that breast-plate the sword of talent cannot force its way through the battle of life, for blows have to be borne as well as dealt. I do not, of course, speak of the conceit that displays itself in an elevated nose and a falsetto voice. That is not real conceit—that is only playing at being conceited; like children play at being kings and queens and go strutting about with feathers and long trains. Genuine conceit does not make a man objectionable. On the contrary, it tends to make him genial, kind-hearted, and simple. He has no need of affectation—he is far too well satisfied with his own character; and his pride is too deep-seated to appear at all on the outside. Careless alike of praise or blame, he can afford to be truthful. Too far, in fancy, above the rest of mankind to trouble about their petty distinctions, he is equally at home with duke or costermonger. And valuing no one’s standard but his own, he is never tempted to practice that miserable pretense that less self-reliant people offer up as an hourly sacrifice to the god of their neighbor’s opinion.</p>

<p>The shy man, on the other hand, is humble—modest of his own judgment and over-anxious concerning that of others. But this in the case of a young man is surely right enough. His character is unformed. It is slowly evolving itself out of a chaos of doubt and disbelief. Before the growing insight and experience the diffidence recedes. A man rarely carries his shyness past the hobbledehoy period. Even if his own inward strength does not throw it off, the rubbings of the world generally smooth it down. You scarcely ever meet a really shy man—except in novels or on the stage, where, by the bye, he is much admired, especially by the women.</p>

<p>There, in that supernatural land, he appears as a fair-haired and saintlike young man—fair hair and goodness always go together on the stage. No respectable audience would believe in one without the other. I knew an actor who mislaid his wig once and had to rush on to play the hero in his own hair, which was jet-black, and the gallery howled at all his noble sentiments under the impression that he was the villain. He—the shy young man—loves the heroine, oh so devotedly (but only in asides, for he dare not tell her of it), and he is so noble and unselfish, and speaks in such a low voice, and is so good to his mother; and the bad people in the play, they laugh at him and jeer at him, but he takes it all so gently, and in the end it transpires that he is such a clever man, though nobody knew it, and then the heroine tells him she loves him, and he is so surprised, and oh, so …</p></div></div>

<p><span>T</span>he average fintech startup founder faces a taxing to-do list: raise seed funding, scope out a user base, recruit talent, build something people will actually use. For the Indonesian entrepreneur, the Muslim-majority market presents an additional hurdle: build an app that is compliant with Islamic religious law, or Sharia.</p>



<p>New fintech startups must present themselves before the Indonesian Ulema Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, or MUI, in Bahasa Indonesian), composed of religious clerics from across the archipelago, for Sharia certification, in order to reach Indonesia’s 220 million Muslim users, who generally seek out products that fit their faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MUI shapes much of Indonesian life. The body has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/bjpwwm/indonesia-just-got-its-first-halal-fridge-heres-a-list-of-everything-else-that-needs-a-stamp">conducted halal audits on household products</a>, verifying that milk, moisturizer, and instant ramen meet strict religious criteria. Its <em>fatwa</em> commission also regularly intervenes in the moral life of Indonesians, promulgating headline-making rulings on <a href="https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/asia-pacific/indonesia/87440-bhimanto-suwastoyo-fatwa-homosexuality-indonesia-death-penalty">homosexuality</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jis/article-abstract/18/2/202/726927">secularism</a>. Since the late 1990s, when Indonesian politics began a turn toward Islamic conservatism, the council’s influence has grown, according to Syafiq Hasyim, a Jakarta-based scholar of MUI and the political economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now MUI is using its policing power to shape a new sector of Indonesian society: consumer technology. In November 2019, Vice President Ma’ruf Amin declared the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3044601/how-sharia-economy-shapes-democracy-indonesia">“Shariatization” of the economy</a> — i.e., the growth of digital financial services catering to Muslim users — a priority for the country’s development. Indonesian Muslim consumers currently spend $224 billion annually. When fintech companies build platforms for these users — whether peer-to-peer lending apps, mobile money services, or online stock-trading portals — MUI acts as the arbiter of their religious legitimacy. MUI’s National Sharia Council (Dewan Syariah Nasional, or DSN) issues certificates that verify platforms are compliant with Sharia. The chairman of DSN just happens to be the vice president himself.</p>



<p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech. New fatwas are added every year on digital finance topics that now include commodities trading online and cryptocurrencies. In the certification process, MUI’s religious scholars become embedded in the early evolution of a company’s digital products, their background not in software engineering or UX design but the traditions and teachings of Islam.</p>

<p>In Sharia, for example, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/riba.asp#:~:text=Riba%20is%20prohibited%20under%20Shari,and%20helping%20others%20through%20kindness.">charging interest, or <em>riba</em></a><em>,</em> is strictly prohibited. Sharia promotes charitable financial dealings and labels interest and guaranteed profits inherently unjust. Instead of a conventional credit model, Sharia lending platforms operate according to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091931230X"><em>mudarabah</em></a>. Under this model, rather than a lender extracting a profit from a borrower, the borrower and lender enter a more equitable contract. For a small-business loan, for example, the lender receives a predetermined share of profits but must also share in the losses, since the borrower has invested labor and knowledge in the business. This model underpins a host of peer-to-peer lending apps targeting Muslim users in Indonesia.</p>



<p>For Sharia stock trading, MUI mandates, under <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxTl-lNihFyzZUxIbkR3RXV4TWc/view">Fatwa No. 80</a>, that traders invest only in halal companies. Online stock trading platforms like MNC Trade Syariah vet all potential listings accordingly, removing any that deal in gambling, alcohol, or pork products.</p>



<p>For some companies, compliance is more of a challenge. Take LinkAja. <a href="https://kr-asia.com/linkaja-ceo-danu-wicaksana-ready-to-be-the-biggest-mobile-payment-platform-in-indonesia">Launched in June 2019</a> and currently serving 45 million registered users, it’s one of the country’s largest mobile money services <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/adv-longform/2019/12/27/why-gojek-users-leave-their-cash-behind-and-turn-to-gopay.html">behind leaders like GoJek’s digital wallet</a> GoPay and OVO. Customers can send, store, or receive electronic money on the LinkAja app. </p>



<p>Late last year, the company announced it was building the first Sharia mobile money product in Indonesia, a digital wallet for Muslim consumers to be called LinkAja Sharia Services. Standard LinkAja app users would be able to go into their settings and switch to a parallel platform built for Sharia compliance. But before they even created a prototype, LinkAja’s team knew they needed to consult MUI.</p>



<p>Most Islamic fintech companies have an appointed head of Sharia, a taskmaster who manages the compliance process. At LinkAja, that person is Widjayanto Djaenudin. While he had no experience in Sharia technology per se, he spent more than a decade at Telkomsel, Indonesia’s largest telecoms operator, developing mobile products for the unbanked. His task at LinkAja was to liaise with MUI and guide the company through its certification process, a challenge, considering the tenuous status of Sharia scholarship on mobile money apps. </p>



<p>Some clerics have argued that <a href="http://www.ikim.gov.my/new-wp/index.php/2019/08/22/some-sharia-considerations-concerning-e-wallet/">digital wallets are a form of <em>haram</em></a>, a term for practices forbidden by Islamic law<em>. </em>The<em> </em>digital-only cash-back rebates and other discounts with partner retailers commonly found on these apps are considered, by some clerics, a form of interest payment between businesses — riba in disguise. MUI has ruled sending and storing money in digital wallets acceptable, but only under strict terms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>To earn a certificate, new startups must adhere to the council’s combined 154 fatwas, a rule book for anyone attempting to build Sharia fintech.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>After conducting a rigorous product-proposal review, MUI appointed a three-member supervisory board to Djaenudin’s team well-versed in the nuances of its rulings. The board included Anwar Abbas, chairman of an Islamic reformist organization in Southern Java’s Yogyakarta and author of a national bestseller promoting the vice president’s “Shariatization” worldview, <a href="https://www.tokopedia.com/dojobuku/ma-ruf-amin-way-sahala-panggabean-by-anwar-abbas"><em>The Ma’ruf Amin Way</em></a><em>. </em>“They are all Sharia experts,” said Djaenudin. “They gave us guidance and consultations about the product.” </p>



<p>Starting in November 2019, shortly after the vice president’s Shariatization initiative, Djaenudin was required to brief these scholars on market research, product testing, and the ins and outs of engineering every month. MUI’s supervisory board would share their insights and ensure the technological infrastructure of the app followed MUI’s rulings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MUI fatwa issued in 2017 was of particular concern to Djaenudin. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPAvhhziJ61Pt8EFxxTFfDPNmRHJoQDG/view">Fatwa No. 116</a> begins with verses from the Quran published in both classical Arabic script and Bahasa Indonesian. “O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write it between you in justice,” reads one verse. They are followed closely by <a href="https://yaqeeninstitute.org/emadhamdeh/are-hadith-necessary/">quotations from books of <em>hadith</em></a>, records of the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: “Do not sell gold for gold, and do not sell silver for silver, except in case of like for like.”</p>



<p>These threads of theological precedent are woven together to create a set of rulings reinterpreting classical verse for the new digital economy. According to the fatwa, these Quranic lines have a specific implication for fintech: floating funds must be housed in certified Islamic banks. Contracts between all parties — users, banking institutions, or the app itself — must be grounded in Sharia contract law. Any promotional campaign cannot include riba.</p>

<p>The supervisory board had other suggestions for LinkAja’s parallel Sharia platform, Djaenudin told <em>Rest of World</em>. The new version of the app embedded a <em>zakat </em>payment feature, <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/zakat/">a form of religious tithing and worship</a> performed through charitable donations, customarily amounting to 2.5% of one’s total savings. After the board signed off on the feature, LinkAja partnered with 240 MUI-approved charitable institutions and 1,000 mosques nationwide <a href="https://news.detik.com/adv-nhl-detikcom/d-5019749/wahai-umat-muslim-ini-cara-mudah-berzakat-lewat-layanan-syariah-linkaja">to launch the zakat feature</a>. Months of vetting culminated in a full audit of LinkAja’s operations at its Jakarta headquarters by MUI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Widjayanto, LinkAja paid a $300 (4 million rupiah) charge to MUI for its Sharia certificate, which lasts three years, including a $20 transportation fee for the auditor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LinkAja Sharia Services <a href="https://www.idnfinancials.com/news/33503/link-aja-launches-linkaja-sharia-services">launched on April 14</a>, just one week before the start of Ramadan. In its first month, it saw 100,000 user registrations. Djaenudin credits the MUI Sharia certificate for this first wave of customers. Most Indonesians prefer to use a Sharia-branded service, even if few understand the particulars of riba or mudarabah, according to LinkAja market research. “From the customer’s perspective, as long as they see the halal logo or Sharia certificate from a trusted body, which is MUI, it gives them clearance and trust,” said Djaenudin.</p>



<p>For Indonesian fintech entrepreneurs hoping to establish their Sharia credentials, the MUI certificate has become the gold standard. Ronald Yusuf Wijaya, the founder of two Sharia-compliant crowdfunding startups, converted to Islam while building his business. “It’s been almost nine years, and I’m learning all of this from the day I started my business,” he said. Wijaya is chairman of the <a href="https://fintechsyariah.id/en">Indonesian Sharia Fintech Association (AFSI)</a>, a trade association that lobbies on behalf of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-digitalpayments-islam/sharia-fintech-startups-race-to-tap-indonesia-growth-by-aligning-with-islam-idUSKBN20Q0IA">this burgeoning pocket of the Indonesian economy</a>. Since converting, Wijaya has successfully navigated MUI Sharia certification with both his companies. “Some customers, they ask, ‘Are you certified, or are you just Sharia?’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For most Sharia fintech startups, MUI certificates are not only commercially advantageous but legally required by the Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK), the state financial regulator. Other areas of the Sharia digital economy, like <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesian-e-commerce-giant-tokopedia-aiming-for-10-of-total-transactions-to-come-from-new-islamic-m">halal e-commerce</a> and <a href="https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/indonesia-gets-first-diy-umrah-platform-e-commerce-giant-starts-selling-pilgrimage-packages"><em>umrah </em>sites</a>, travel-booking platforms for Islamic pilgrimages, do not require this certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ir. H. Nadratuzzaman Hosen, vice chair of DSN MUI, told <em>Rest of World</em> that MUI is a passive actor in the development of new apps — waiting idly for companies to seek its approval rather than imposing fatwas on companies as a theocratic …</p></div></div>

        <p>Navigation menus are one of the most-viewed and most-clicked-on pieces of interface. Let’s look at some principles of nav design that will help our users have a better experience.</p>

<h2 id="1-placement-matters">1) Placement matters</h2>

<p>The web has developed a clear pattern for where navigation goes (very top, left side, or in the footer). When menus are placed outside of these areas, it feels awkward, confusing, and hard to find.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-1.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="2-show-them-where-they-are">2) Show them where they are</h2>

<p>Clearly communicate the user’s current location. Use multiple clues, like the ones below, to help them orient themselves. Our users should never have to wonder where they are.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-2.png">
</figure>



<p>Research shows that mega menus provide a better experience than list dropdowns because they show everything at a glance, are able to utilize imagery, allow for better grouping, and feel more engaging.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-3.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="4-effective-link-titles">4) Effective link titles</h2>

<p>A user should be able to easily predict where a link will take them before they click it (this is called information scent). The single biggest factor in this is how good of a job we do at link labeling.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-4.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="5-how-many-items">5) How many items?</h2>

<p>The right number of items in your menu depends on a few things, like how complicated your product is or how savvy your users are. But try to get to fewer than 6 or 7 items. The order also matters.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-5.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="6-dont-hide-it">6) Don’t hide it</h2>

<p>Navigation menus are one of the most-clicked-on pieces of interface, and they provide major contextual information to the user, so it should always be visible.</p>

<p>The default on mobile these days seems to be the hamburger menu, but there are alternatives that don’t hide the nav completely: tabs, progressive collapsing, scrollable lists, and so on.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/ux-design-for-navigation-menus/post-6.png">
</figure>

<h2 id="7-visual-design-tips">7) Visual design tips</h2>

<p>Good UI design makes a big difference. Below are a few tips to create a better experience. When in doubt, test! And don’t forget about accessibility.</p>

<article>
  <p>This blog post discusses the support for Rightward assignments in ruby.</p>

<h3 id="before">Before</h3>

<p>Historically, all of the early programming languages were designed by Mathematicians. It’s a common practice in mathematics to say <code>let x = 4y + z</code>, which is read as let <code>x</code> be equal to <code>4y + z</code>.</p>

<p>So the same pattern is followed in programming languages as well.</p>

<p>For assigning a value to a variable, we typically do <code>age = 42</code> in ruby. Here we are assigning the <code>Rvalue</code> <code>42</code> to an <code>Lvalue</code> <code>age</code>.</p>

<p>While the above pattern has become standardized, it feels somewhat unnatural as we read most of the spoken languages from left to right.</p>

<p>We were not able to do something like <code>42 =&gt; age</code>.</p>

<h3 id="after">After</h3>

<p>With the recent <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/1b2d351b216661e03d497dfdce216e0d51474664#diff-8312ad0561ef661716b48d09478362f3">changes</a>, Ruby supports the <strong>Right ward assignments</strong> as demonstrated below.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>3</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>box_height</span> <span># This is equivalent to box_height = 3</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a look at few more examples:</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>traits</span>
  <span>[</span><span>170</span><span>,</span> <span>65</span><span>]</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>traits</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>height</span><span>,</span> <span>weight</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>



<h3 id="additional-notes">Additional notes:</h3>

<p>There are already some languages which support rightward assignment.</p>

<p><code>TI-BASIC’s</code> uses STO (“store”) operation to achieve this, as demonstrated below:</p>

<p><code>42→age</code></p>

<p><code>R language</code> also has a similar way of doing this  <code>42 -&gt; age</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is added as an experimental feature in Ruby, which means it could be removed depending on the feedback received.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started being developed internally at Facebook back in 2012, before being publicly released as open-source in 2015. <strong>GraphQL is a query language for APIs</strong>, its main advantage is allowing clients to query exactly for the type of data that is required. The definitions of all the data clients can query through the service are stored in GraphQL schema. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.</p>
<p>GraphQL is language-agnostic which makes it fairly easy to be adopted across different technologies, one of its successful implementations is done in Rust, by a library called Juniper.</p>
<h2>Code- first, fast &amp; type-safe GraphQL Servers in Rust</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper">Juniper</a></strong> is a code-first approach that allows you to write <strong>type-safe and super fast GraphQL servers in Rust</strong>, keeping declaring and resolving GraphQL schemas as easy as possible.</p>
<p>GraphQL query language is fully supported, including interfaces, unions, schema introspection, validations, as well as some basic Rust crates integrations allowing you to use popular Rust types as <code>uuid</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>chrono</code>, or <code>bson</code> out of the box. </p>
<p>As previously mentioned <strong>Juniper is a code-first library</strong>, if you prefer the schema-first approach you can use <a href="https://github.com/davidpdrsn/juniper-from-schema">juniper-from-schema</a> to <strong>auto-generate resolvers</strong> for your GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>Although Juniper does not provide a built-in web server functionality it comes with building blocks to make integration with your servers as seamless as possible, as well as optionally providing pre-built integration for popular Rust web frameworks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actix,</li>
<li>Hyper,</li>
<li>Iron,</li>
<li>Rocket, </li>
<li>Warp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example of Juniper integration for Actix</h2>
<p>Below you can find a sample Juniper integration with the <strong>Actix web framework</strong>. The servers run on <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> and has built-in GraphiQL for easier testing. Star it with:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>cd examples/juniper
cargo run (or ``cargo watch -x run``)</code></pre></div>

<p>On September 1st, Gartner released the first edition of the Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services. This Magic Quadrant contained many interesting analyses, but one stood out to me - not in the least because I’ve experienced it firsthand. AWS needs to step up its DevOps game.</p>
<p>You can find the full Gartner report <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-242R58F3&amp;ct=200902&amp;st=sb">here</a>.</p>
<h3>CIaaS to CIPS</h3>
<p>“Wait” you might say. “Doesn’t Gartner release a Magic Quadrant for public cloud every year?”. And yes, they they do. But it used to be called the Magic Quadrant for <strong>Cloud Infrastructure as a Service</strong>, or CIaaS. They deprecated that series in favor of the new Magic Quadrant for <strong>Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services</strong>, or CIPS.</p>
<p>This is a logical, but significant change. CIaaS focused on the public cloud services that could replace the infrastructure in your existing data center; virtual machines, databases, networking, hard drives and so on. Every modern public cloud provider offers a strong IaaS foundation. But what differentiates the public cloud providers are their platform services, which are unavailable in most private clouds: databases as a service, infinite object storage, integrated monitoring, and so on. Using these additional PaaS offerings lead to higher availability, better security, better performance, more advanced features and better integrations, while reducing operational overhead. As such, the quality and broadness of these features often define the value of a public cloud provider to a business.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scope of the Magic Quadrant for CIPS includes IaaS and integrated platform as a service (PaaS) platforms. These include application PaaS (aPaaS), functions as a service (FaaS), database PaaS (dbPaaS), application developer PaaS (adPaaS) and industrialized private cloud offerings that are often deployed in enterprise data centers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Development tools</h3>
<p>From that statement, the term ‘application developer PaaS (adPaaS)’ stood out to me. To fully benefit from the features offered by public cloud, application developers will need to deploy new features often, quickly, and consistently. Often a new feature release requires changes in the infrastructure as well: think deploying new SQS queues or S3 buckets, or updating the launch configuration of an autoscaling group.</p>
<p>To optimize the development workflow and receive quick feedback on new features, deployment tools often integrate with version control systems (can we just say Git? Everybody uses Git). Examples are automatically running tests and integrations, automatically deploying branches to test environments, and automatic notifications and rollbacks when an issue arises.</p>
<p>The functionality for managing all these automated steps is provided by application developer tools. In AWS, these can generally be recognized by their <code>Code</code> prefix: CodePipeline, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and a few others.</p>
<p>For application developers with a DevOps workflow, the quality and feature richness of these tools is even more significant. For these users, every step in the development and deployment flow needs to be automated and executed as soon as possible. And new solutions or insights for the deployment pipeline need to be tested and deployed as soon as possible as well. For this group of developers, the versatility of the tooling might be one of the biggest differentiators in choosing a public cloud.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All the providers offer basic cloud IaaS — compute, storage and networking resources as a service. They also offer additional value-added capabilities, notably cloud software infrastructure services — typically middleware and databases as a service — including PaaS capabilities. These services, along with IT operations management (ITOM) capabilities as a service (especially DevOps-related services), are a vital differentiator in the market, especially for Mode 2 agile IT buyers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Current state</h3>
<p>This is a significant risk for AWS - because their tooling simply is not that versatile.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle to dynamic workflows is Amazon’s CodePipeline - ostensibly the glue and management layer for all the other application development services in the AWS ecosystem. This is a diagram from CodePipeline’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/">product page</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/6asEvn3tLQKyl6BnH5onvC/6ec55a160e00b17460480946fe613c5e/codepipeline.png" alt="CodePipeline"></p>
<p>From this overview we can deduce that CodePipeline should be able to take your source code, build it, test it, deploy it to a staging environment, and promote it to a production environment. And this is definitely possible, as long as you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use one of the supported Git providers (not self-hosted or GitLab)</li>
<li>Build based on branches, not tags</li>
<li>Always use the same branch</li>
<li>Don’t have parallel builds</li>
<li>Don’t need a choice step</li>
<li>… and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>But it’s not all doom and gloom. CodePipeline is also:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the few pipeline providers (maybe the only one) that can be completely defined in code (CloudFormation)</li>
<li>Completely serverless</li>
<li>Pay as you go and very affordable ($1.00 per pipeline per month)</li>
</ul>
<p>A recent customer had some requirements that couldn’t be fulfilled by CodePipeline. We didn’t want to host and maintain a Jenkins or GitLab server (hooray for serverless), and didn’t want to pay the subscription cost for online hosted services because they are very expensive. So we ended up building our own deployment management solution. The end result is shown below. I wish I was kidding.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/7q41Vx0buq7BZMrMftmo5v/ee5638306dcbafccf20d40e08551c555/Gartner_MQ2020_Post.jpeg" alt="CICD Diagram"></p>
<p>In a nutshell, because CodePipeline does not allow for dynamic pipelines and does not have a dynamic frontend, we had to build Lambda functions for the different deployment steps and a frontend to access these functions. We used DynamoDB to store history (for rollbacks), CodeBuild for compilation and deployments, and Cognito for user management.</p>
<p>In researching and designing the solution above, I’ve seen many suggestions to adjust your Git workflow to better fit the CodePipeline feature set. The worst of these is “use branches, not tags” (related to another example than the one above). These “solutions” would force you to adjust your developer workflow to the tooling you’re using, which should never be necessary.</p>
<h4>The Azure side of things</h4>
<p>I am not very familiar with Azure, but I hear and read great things about their family of deployment tools: Azure DevOps. Additionally, Microsoft made the <em>extremely</em> smart strategic decision to acquire GitHub in 2018. GitHub Actions is a great example of how powerful DevOps tools should work, and having that in their portfolio bodes well for Microsoft’s future.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft is making a concerted effort to better serve software developers, particularly through its efforts with OSS. Microsoft leads the hyperscale cloud providers in terms of market share in the application developer PaaS segment with its suite of tools that include Azure DevOps and Github.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>An opportunity to differentiate</h3>
<p>For AWS, the risk of being behind in this segment might actually be larger than just being a bit less appealing to developers. In fact, the developers tools segment might become the big differentiator between the leaders in the CIPS sector. Let me explain.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/5qra1wuY3Y2noQKGxUEog3/48f931aa7c92dc8f9f470d2130599bf0/evolving_market.jpg" alt="Evolving Market"></p>
<p>In this diagram you see a number common technologies available in public clouds. On the left you see technology used by almost everyone: there are very few workloads that don’t use some virtual machines, networking, databases or object storage solutions. These technologies are very mature and offered by every cloud provider. This means it is very hard to differentiate in this area.</p>
<p>On the right you see more exotic technologies like quantum computing and machine learning. There are relatively few businesses using these technologies, and the market is still evolving. It is a lot easier to differentiate or to come up with a completely new service offering in this area. The demand will be low, however, so public cloud providers won’t be winning over a large segment of the public cloud market with these technologies.</p>
<p>The sweet spot is in the middle - for these technologies the market is still evolving, but there is also significant demand for solutions in this space. Just google for “Deployment pipeline software” and count the number of providers. Having a solid offering of versatile deployment tools will help win over application builders, software development managers, product managers, or, as Gartner said: “Mode 2 agile IT buyers”.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>So what’s next for AWS? Well, Gartner marked them as the absolute leader on both the ‘Completeness of Vision’ and ‘Ability to Execute’ axes. In this case, they need to execute. They can do this in two ways.</p>
<p>First option: empower and motivate the Developer Services team to significantly extend the feature set of CodePipeline or release them as a new, more powerful service (AWS DevOps?).</p>
<p>Or, my preferred suggestion: <strong>acquire GitLab</strong> and offer its functionality as a new, serverless, pay-as-you-go, fully managed and cost-effective AWS service (AWS DevOps?).</p>
<p>This would bring AWS back to the frontlines of developer services and make them a worthy adversary to Azure DevOps. It would technically be a war-by-proxy between GitHub and GitLab - our own nerdy version of Batman vs. Superman!</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/28eULnZrYzpDWaNzD9wCZr/7ebed4999b927274bc73e28ef46cbc77/batman_superman.jpg" alt="Batman vs Superman"></p>
<h3>Other thoughts about the Magic Quadrant</h3>
<p>There is a lot more to the new Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure and Platform Services report. Some tidbits that jumped out:</p>
<h4>1. Managed and professional services are an optional but important accelerator for customer success</h4>
<p>I wrote a post about this exactly two weeks ago and could not agree more. Read it here: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/the-difference-between-managed-services-and-professional-services-and-why">the difference between managed services and professional services - and why you need both</a>.</p>
<h4>2. Microsoft has the lowest ratio of availability zones to regions of any vendor in this Magic Quadrant</h4>
<p>I was not aware of this. There were some other related statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google’s much-vaunted network capabilities have been the source of a number of GCP outages during the last year, with devastating impact on customers. One outage was multiregional in scope, affecting GCP customers and Google consumer services, such as G Suite and YouTube. This resulted in complete GCP network …</li></ol></div></div>

					<p>The LinkedIn Ads network is likely awash in mistaken clicks and bot traffic that make the platform’s value extremely dubious, according to a new study from global digital agency RMG that the company shared exclusively with me.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, RMG founding partner Ryan Gellis <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryan-gellis_theory-the-linkedin-ad-network-is-full-of-activity-6700077824360910848-LysO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a thread</a> wondering if LinkedIn “is full of fraudulent accounts and unchecked misclicks that artificially inflate the cost of advertising and result in poor performance compared to other ad networks.” The ensuing discussion inspired him to look into the issue further.</p>
<center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKuyxgWuiRM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center><p>Gellis goes through his findings <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKuyxgWuiRM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in this YouTube video</a>. For the test, RMG promoted a webinar by targeting c-certain c-suite executives at large companies in the United States based on their job titles. The ad encouraged them to click to sign up for for event for free.</p>
<p>The first issue the agency found was the projected versus actual cost per click. LinkedIn estimated a $25 average CPC. The actual campaign CPC was nearly $45.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of forecasting if you project one cost and then the actual cost ends up being 200% the projection?” Gellis asks in the video.</p>
<p>But the real issue was the source of the clicks themselves. LinkedIn’s ad platform reported 11 clicks. RMG’s logs showed ten clicks. <a href="https://www.fullstory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStory</a>, the digital experience analytics platform that RMG uses, stated that eight people registered for the webinar. However, the true number of registrations was zero.</p>
<p>“Zero people signed up for the webinar from that specific campaign,” Gellis told me in an interview. “That’s kind of the punch line and why I believe this is newsworthy. Nobody signed up. In fact, nobody even exhibited what I believe is real user behavior on the site after clicking the ad. That is also true of all the other ads we ran on LinkedIn. We had a total of 0 people ever “sign up” on any ad we ran during our testing on LinkedIn — regardless of the ad format or messaging.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rmgmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMG</a> suspects bot activity or misattributed misclicks had been the cause because visitors would bounce away from the webinar’s landing page before it even had a chance to render — in other words, they would click the LinkedIn advertisement and then leave the website in less than 1.3 seconds. In addition, FullStory reported mouse movements that were nothing like what an actual human would do.</p>
<p>“As far as we’re concerned, the LinkedIn ad network basically has fraudulent clicks and/or misclicks that don’t get attributed to the users that are being passed through as leads in campaigns,” Gellis says in the video.</p>
<p>Of course, the simple size in RMG’s one-day test was extremely small. The target audience size was 16,000. The number of impressions would be between 680 and 2,000. The cost was $250. But Gellis told me that the results match a prior, larger test.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png" alt="linkedin ads" width="660" height="197" data-eio="l" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 660 197'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.samueljscott.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/linkedin-ads.png"></p>
<p>During a $3,000 campaign in March, LinkedIn reported 256 clicks with an average CPC of $11. The company received zero leads from all of the clicks.</p>
<p>“You’ll see the call to action is ‘Request Demo,'” Gellis said. “So, arguably, a user who sees this ad and clicks legitimately on it will be looking to get a demo of the analytics tool we were marketing. If the ads were giving us behavior like this on a $3,000-per-month budget, it’s unlikely they would have performed any better with additional budget.”</p>
<p>RMG charges that LinkedIn’s advertising is on a closed network and does not follow the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s <a href="https://www.iab.com/guidelines/iab-measurement-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards for digital advertising</a>. (The IAB did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>After reviewing RMG’s findings, a LinkedIn spokesperson sent me the following company statement.</p>
<p>“LinkedIn is a members-first organization and our&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/ads-policy&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFsmfrYAHwHhV6tM-nG54kogFWEw">Ads program</a></u>&nbsp;is designed to ensure that only high-quality, relevant ads are served to our members. We prohibit the use of bots or other automated fraudulent methods to access our services, as they are in violation of the&nbsp;<u><a title="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1599566456486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErEgCF6J2mC2B2u6Rnd32Ialafiw">User Agreement.</a></u>&nbsp;Additionally, LinkedIn is a&nbsp;member of the IAB&nbsp;and works closely with the organization and its members to help develop standards for the digital advertising industry.”</p>
<p>But when summarizing his findings in the video, Gellis is skeptical of LinkedIn.</p>
<p>“As far as we can tell, LinkedIn is basically a money pit,” he says. “You’re not going to get the performance that you would expect out of the network.”</p>
<p><strong>(Note: For more, <a href="https://www.samueljscott.com/2019/02/26/fake-online-fake-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see my recent talk on how much of the Internet is fake</a>.)</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a href="https://www.ego-cms.com/tags/xamarin"><p>Xamarin</p></a><h2>Native vs Hybrid vs Cross-platform Mobile app – What to Choose?</h2><p>Understand how native apps differ from hybrid mobile apps. See what makes cross-platform apps exceedingly functional with this highly informative guide to choosing the right mobile app for your next project. 
</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>With the surging enthusiasm towards the development of apps for mobile devices, there has been a myriad of questions &amp; lots of confusion over cross-platform vs native vs hybrid app development approaches, particularly from novice developers. The lack of enough end-to-end resources for<strong> </strong>choosing the right mobile app approach has continued to serve as a major barrier to finding a lasting solution for the iOS vs Android banter.&nbsp; <br></p><p>Even so, given that both platforms are critical for a fruitful mobile app strategy, <strong>cross platform mobile app development might seem to be the best answer for this debate.</strong> Today it is no longer tenable to simply build an app that targets only one platform – we need multi-platform apps that can support both Android and iPhone smartphones and ensure no one is left out.<br></p><h2>Cross-Platform Mobile Apps</h2><p>There are distinct operating systems running on various smartphones with Android and iOS featuring as the most widely used. Each of these platforms utilizes a distinctive programming environment with its own language and API.<br></p><p>As such, the need by mobile developers to reach the largest possible user-base, regardless of their preferred platform has given rise to more value being seen in a cross platform mobile app. Tools like Xamarin have made cross-platform app development widely popular and accessible.&nbsp;</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1110px"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d1dce88a848086dd0875bab_Cross-Platform-Mobile-Apps.jpg"></p></figure><h4>What is Cross-Platform Application?</h4><p>Cross-Platform Application<strong> </strong>simply alludes to the advancement of mobile applications that can be utilized across a variety of different operating systems. It is the process of developing apps compatible with multiple mobile platforms using a solitary codebase, rather than having to create the app on multiple occasions using the respective native technologies for each platform.</p><h4>Why a Cross-Platform App?</h4><p>Applications created utilizing a cross-platform framework are free from OS impulses and thus offer multi-platform usefulness.&nbsp;They provide an incredible solution when you need to release a mobile app on different platforms at a low cost or constrained budget in terms of money, time and effort.&nbsp;</p><h4>Pros of Developing a Cross-Platform Mobile App</h4><ul><li><strong>It’s cost-effective. </strong>The issue of native app vs cross platform apps can be debated but when it comes to cost efficiency, cross-platform development beats the latter hands down. In addition to most cross-platform development tools being unreservedly available, the approach further spares the cost of having to contract separate developers to create apps for different platforms.</li><li><strong>It’s reusable.</strong> With cross-platform apps, developers no longer have to write unique code for each operating system. They can instead use a common codebase to transfer the code to different platforms.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>It allows you to reach a wider audience</strong>. Creating a multi platform app frees developers from the need to choose among platforms - they can target both Android and iOS users without losing the potential audience.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consistent app performance across platforms</strong>. If a developer writes a native app for each operating system, the two might require significant changes when it comes to UI and features supported due to the differences in how the two platforms implement functions. With cross-platform apps, drastic changes between the applications on various systems are not much of an issue as the two share a common codebase. This way there will be fewer visible performance and UI changes, so your brand identity will remain coherent.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Cons of Developing a Cross-Platform Mobile App</h4><ul><li><strong>Complex development process</strong>. It takes a skilled developer to create an application that would be well-adapted to a few platforms. Basically, there’s a need to keep all the little differences between operating systems and the hardware they run on especially when it comes to implementing a complex interface and features.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Challenging integration.</strong> Developers can experience difficulties while integrating cross-platform applications to local setting and engaging a third-party cloud service provider. The code of an HTML5 cross-platform app is complicated as the result of callback-style programming used to communicate with native plugins.</li><li><strong>User experience might be somewhat limited</strong>. A cross-platform app might not be able to offer a wide array of user journeys. This is mainly caused by the fact that there are features that are supported only by a particular operating system.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4><strong>Times when you should consider developing a cross-platform app:</strong></h4><ul><li>When it’s not clear right away which platform is more lucrative to go with</li><li>Your app doesn’t have any sophisticated features that would be to challenging to maintain over different platforms&nbsp;</li><li>Budget constraints don’t allow you to hire separate teams to create both Android and iOS applications <br></li></ul><h3>Cross-Platform App Examples</h3><p>There are dozens of cross-platform apps that we use every day. They prove the efficiency of cross-platform development as well as the benefit from creating products for a few platforms with tools like React or Nativescript simultaneously.</p><h4>Facebook <a href="https://code.fb.com/android/dive-into-react-native-performance/" data-rt-link-type="external">↗</a></h4><p>Back in 2012, Mark Zuckerberg stated at a TechCrunch Disrupt conference: <em>“The biggest mistake we’ve made as a company is betting on HTML5 over native.”</em> He noted that the experience of maintaining a native app on iOS has proven to be faster in the long run and more liberating than the hybrid approach the company used before. Hybrid apps are known to be quite slow for users, and, as a high-traffic application, Facebook needed to provide as fast and seamless of an experience as possible. That’s why the company has shifted from HTML to React Native - a framework designed to create native Android and iOS apps.</p><h4>Skype <a href="https://dev.skype.com/react" data-rt-link-type="external">↗</a></h4><p>Skype has been around for quite a while now - it is widely used across various devices and operating systems. In fact, a famous communication tool is a cross platform app developed with Electron. On a PC scale, it shares a codebase between Windows and Linux. When it comes to smartphones, Skype has a cross-platform iOS/Android app.&nbsp;</p><p>The user experience of Skype doesn’t suffer from system limitations or a complex codebase. In fact, last year, the development team completely redesigned the app to make sure it looks native-alike.&nbsp;</p><h4>Slack <a href="https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/137078/most-popular-xamarin-apps" data-rt-link-type="external">↗</a></h4><p>Slack is proof that a cross-platform app can still have a ‘native’ feel to it. Apart from simplifying the group communication process, Slack enables access to bots and can help operate various day-to-day work tasks.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Over the span of just a few years, the platform has become everyone’s favorite collaboration service. If they would have had to choose one operating system, Slack would’ve lost a huge chunk of its audience and would never have arrived at its current peak.&nbsp;</p><h4>Alibaba <a href="https://medium.com/fuzzycloud/cross-platform-mobile-development-c9f3c2448ad8" data-rt-link-type="external">↗</a></h4><p>The app of a largest online retailer is a cross-platform app created with Flutter. There are dozens of features available - a shopper’s account, a reliable payment framework with a checkout system, shipping integrations, the display of user ratings and reviews, etc.&nbsp;This array of features supported proves that frequent complaints about the lack of features in cross-platform apps at times don’t have their merit.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hybrid Mobile Apps</h2><p>Hybrid apps are the golden mean between native and web applications. They consist of two parts - backend code and a native viewer that can be downloaded to display the backend in a web view. Unlike web apps, hybrid mobile apps don’t require a browser for access and can take advantage of any plugin and the APIs of a device. They are cheaper in development than native apps but their performance is mostly slower as well.&nbsp;</p><figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="1110px"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d1dcec3c38e0d62d557bed9_Htbrid_app.jpg"></p></figure><h4>What is a Hybrid Application?</h4><p>A hybrid application allows a developer to combine the speed of web development with the ability to use the functions of a device - access to the camera, GPS, etc. - to provide an enhanced user experience.&nbsp;Hybrid apps are built using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS - similar to web-applications.

Due to the fact that hybrid apps are essentially web-based, they don’t work without the Internet connection.

<h2>Neuromorphic Computing: The Next-Level Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/neuromorphic-computing.jpg" title=""></p>

<p>Can AI function like a human brain? - Researchers have been asking this question for decades and their long-drawn-out pursuit has invoked doubts, ridicule, scorn, and what not.</p>
<p>But now, armed with Neuromorphic Computing, they are ready to show the world that their dream can change the world for better. As we unearth the benefits, the success of our machine learning and AI quest seem to depend to a great extent on the success of Neuromorphic Computing.</p><h4>How Neuromorphic Computing Can Help Contemporary AI</h4><p>The technologies of the future like autonomous vehicles and robots will need access to and utilization of an enormous amount of data and information in real-time. Today, to a limited extent, this is done by machine learning and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/quantum-computing-feedstock-for-artificial-intelligence">AI that depend on supercomputer power</a>. But these needs are extending and speed, power, and size are emerging as prime impediments.</p>
<p>Neuromorphic Computing chips can process multiple facts, learn tasks and patterns at high speed. These chips are expected to consume less power (up to 1000 times less) and can work with the efficiency of supercomputers.</p>
<p>Neuromorphic Computing chips, a crucial upgrade in traditional systems, are compact, portable, and energy-efficient. They are the perfect sidekick ML and AI models need.</p>
<p>Researchers know it and so they are leaving no stone unturned. While a few are getting as literal as copying the physical form of the human brain, others are trying to replicate its function. It’s the latter we are optimistic about as they are expected to replace Gordon Moore’s groundbreaking idea of “packing transistors onto substrates”.</p>
<p>Neuromorphic computing involves the production and use of neural networks to function like a human brain, making decisions and also memorizing information and analyzing facts. It “demonstrates an unprecedented low-power computation substrate that can be used in many applications."- <span>IBM neuromorphic patent application</span></p>
<h4> Recent Developments</h4>
<p>Though many innovators are driven to the cause, a few are leading the race. Here’s a look at important developments:</p><p><b>Intel’s Loihi - The Future of GPUs</b></p>
<p>A 14-nanometer chip with over 2 billion transistors and three managing Lakemont cores. “It contains a programmable microcode engine for on-chip training of asynchronous spiking neural networks (SNNs). Total, it has 128 cores packs. Each core has a built-in learning module and a total of around 131,000 computational “neurons” that communicate with one another, allowing the chip to understand stimuli.”</p>
<p>Loihi can identify ten hazardous materials by smelling them faster than sniffer dogs. It can also detect toxic fumes and diseases around it and can re-wire itself to facilitate different forms of learning.</p>
<p>In the future, it is expected to learn from experiences and make decisions on its own. Icing on the cake, it uses a fragment of energy and is expected to replace GPUs.</p>
<p><b>IBM’s TrueNorth - The Hercules of Transistor Count</b></p>
<p>It has 4,096 cores, Samsung’s 28nm process with 5.4 billion transistors. It is IBM’s largest chip in transistor count and uses less than 100Mw of power while simulating complex recurrent neural networks. It has a power density of 20mW / cm2.</p>
<p>TrueNorth’s architecture can address the problems of “vision, audition, and multi-sensory fusion, and has the potential to revolutionize the computer industry by integrating brain-like capability into devices where computation is constrained by power and speed.”</p>
<p>IBM says it can efficiently process “high-dimensional, noisy sensory data in real-time”. TrueNorth consumes less power than a conventional computer.</p>
<p><b>MIT’s - Brain on A Chip</b></p>
<p>A chip built from silicon geranium and with “more than 100 trillion synapses that mediate neuron signaling in the brain”. In one simulation it represented human handwriting with 95 percent accuracy. It could be used in making humanoids and autonomous driving technology.</p>
<p><b>Qualcomm’s - Zeroth processors</b></p>
<p>Working on three main goals of “biologically inspired learning; enabling devices to see and perceive the world as humans do and; creating and defining Neural Processing Unit—NPU”, Qualcomm is developing new computer architecture that dismantles the traditional mold.</p>
<h4>The Road Ahead</h4>
<p>Neuromorphic computing can greatly impact the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/ai-and-machine-learning-are-reshaping-the-global-banking-industry">future of machine learning and AI</a>. “These new kind of chips should increase dramatically the use of machine learning, enabling applications to consume less power and at the same time become more responsive.”-Deloitte market analysis</p>
<p>With Neuromorphic Computing at its side, the future of AI sure looks bright.</p>
<h4>Trivia:</h4>
<p>Did you know?</p>            
<ul>
<li><p>Neuromorphic Computing is the 5th generation of AI.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1st generation AI defined rules and followed classical logic to arrive at conclusions within a specific, narrowly outlined problem domain.</p></li>
<li><p>The 2nd generation AI used deep learning networks to analyze the inputs and were focused on sensing and perception.</p></li>
<li><p>The 3rd generation AI interpreted and adapted like the human thought process.</p></li>
<li><p>The 4th generation AI used a mix of different machine learning algorithms and other forms of Artificial Intelligence algorithms to achieve their goal or mission.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A small list of methods for fast file system navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t advocate for one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>

<p>At the beginning, just after learning to use the command line, my terminal navigation included a lot of <code>cd</code> and a lot of <code>ls</code>.
I jumped around folders, learned shortcuts like, <code>cd ~</code>, <code>cd -</code>, and started becoming familiar with the shell.
Having multi-argument commands for quick file manipulation felt powerful and fresh, or so I remember.</p>

<p>After going to command line you no longer have to open folders in a graphical window manager, scan their names, use <code>&lt;ctrl + mouse click&gt;</code> to select them, and then drag the mouse to move those selected folders to another place.
You do <code>'mv pattern* place/'</code> instead.
All is nice.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Along the way I started organizing my folders using a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── bitbucket
    │   └── user1
    │       ├── repo1
    │       └── repo2
    ├── github
    │   ├── user1
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user2
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user3
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   ├── repo2
    │   │   ├── repo3
    │   │   └── repo4
    │   └── user4
    │       └── repo1
    ├── teaching
    │   ├── class1
    │   │   ├── lecture1
    │   │   └── lecture2
    │   └── class2
    │       ├── lecture1
    │       └── lecture2
    ├─── clients
    │   ├── client1
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   ├── client2
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   └── client3
    │      └── project1
    └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>I often had to go in and out of various project folders and my <code>cd</code> + <code>ls</code> navigation became tedious.
Reaching a project involved navigating a big tree of directories.
On top of that a lot of directories had similar names which got in the way of tab completion.
This is where I found “z” - a command line utility that tracks your most visited folders based on frequency and recency<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>.</p>

<p>“z” keeps a database of your most frequently used folders and allows to quickly jump to these folders even if you don’t remember their full name.
Instead of doing a lot of <code>cd</code> + <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> all you have to do is type <code>'z proj'</code> and <code>z</code> will take you to your most frequently/recently accessed folder that has <code>proj</code> somewhere in its name.
It takes a short amount of time for “z” to learn about your most visited places but after that it becomes quick and convenient.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>

<p>“z” didn’t always take me where I wanted to be.
It worked, I would say, around 95% of the time or more.
But those other times it took me to an unrelated directory and distracted from the work at hand forcing to navigate my way back using the old <code>cd</code>.
Moreover, sometimes I moved and renamed various folders which likely contributed to its disorientation.</p>

<p>After this experience I decided that the terminal should be dumb and deterministic without any fuzziness or smart guessing.
And here I found <code>marks</code> - a short and sweet command line script for keeping manual directory bookmarks.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a>
It consisted of 4 tiny functions: one for creating a mark, one for removing, one for listing all the marks, and one for jumping to the bookmarked folder:</p>

<pre><code>export MARKPATH=$HOME/.marks

function mark {
  mkdir -p "$MARKPATH"; ln -s "$(pwd)" "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function unmark {
  rm -i "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function marks {
  ls -l "$MARKPATH" | sed 's/  / /g' | cut -d' ' -f9- | sed 's/ -/\t-/g' &amp;&amp; echo
}

function jump {
  cd -P "$MARKPATH/$1" 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "No such mark: $1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as a function generating completion suggestions after pressing <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>_completemarks() {
  local curw=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
  local wordlist=$(find $MARKPATH -type l -printf "%f\n")
    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${wordlist[@]}' -- "$curw"))
    return 0
}

complete -F _completemarks jump unmark
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow of marks is manual but convenient.
You have to go into the directory you want to bookmark and execute the <code>mark</code> command followed by the custom name, like <code>'mark myproject'</code>.
After that you can quickly jump back to this bookmarked folder using <code>'jump myproject'</code> and when the bookmark is no longer relevant you can get rid of it with <code>'unmark myproject'</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach the user is in control.
There is no secret smart behaviour which means no auto-magic and no surprises.
And after moving a project to another place the bookmark can be easily adjusted to point to its new location immediately, without waiting for a hidden automatic process to update its location, frequency, and recency.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

<p>Neither of those <code>jump</code> nor <code>z</code> commands could take me everywhere I needed to go.
So the typical workflow would start with jumping to a project via the <code>jump</code> command but then switching to the old navigation via <code>cd</code> once inside it.
Which meant that for navigating the file system I always had to keep using both: <code>jump</code> and <code>cd</code>.
And having two distinct commands for doing the same thing felt a bit weird.
This is where I learned about the <code>$CDPATH</code><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>◦</sup></a> variable and rolled out my own solution.</p>

<p>All you have to do is add this to your .bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>export CDPATH=.:~/.marks/
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add a bookmark called <code>@name</code> pointing to a <code>"dir"</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>ln -sr dir ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p>To delete a bookmark:</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p>To jump to its location:</p>

<pre><code>cd @name
</code></pre>

<p>And to list all available bookmarks:</p>

<pre><code>cd @&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$CDPATH</code> solution works best when all the bookmarks are started with a special symbol which in my case was <code>@</code>.
This solves a couple of problems.
One, the bookmarked directories, if prefixed with <code>@</code> symbol, will not interfere with directories in the current folder.
Second, all the available bookmarks will be displayed by typing <code>'cd @&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.
And third, all bookmarks are now part of <code>cd</code> and so they gain tab completion for free.
You can even use tab completion for jumping directly to folders nested within bookmarks by doing <code>'cd @bookmark/subfolder/'</code>.</p>

<p>Using this method you no longer have to maintain a short list of custom bookmark functions and their autocompletion in your .bashrc.
And command for “change directory” can always be done with the same old and familiar <code>cd</code> command, independant of context.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="springagain">Spring again</h2>

<p>After working with the <code>$CDPATH</code> approach for a while I began noticing something peculiar.
At no point in time did I have a list with a dozen or more bookmarks.
Instead I found myself constantly going to the same 2 or 3 projects, finishing them, removing them from <code>~/.marks/</code> folder, adding new ones, and repeating the cycle again.
Why would someone keep bookmarks for 3 directories?</p>

<p>This time, instead of changing the command, I tried to do something different and changed the folder structure.
My projects moved from the state of being relevant to being archived so why not create an archive directory and organize folders based not on their name or type but on state?
Thus the <code>"zzz"</code> folder was born.
And now my project structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── active_project1
    ├── active_project2
    └── zzz
        ├── bitbucket
        │   └── user1
        │       ├── repo1
        │       └── repo2
        ├── github
        │   ├── user1
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user2
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user3
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   ├── repo2
        │   │   ├── repo3
        │   │   └── repo4
        │   └── user4
        │       └── repo1
        ├── teaching
        │   ├── class1
        │   │   ├── lecture1
        │   │   └── lecture2
        │   └── class2
        │       ├── lecture1
        │       └── lecture2
        ├─── clients
        │   ├── client1
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   ├── client2
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   └── client3
        │      └── project1
        └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>With this structure the bookmarking systems no longer provide big benefits as most frequent and recent folders are always under ~/work/some_project.
And since at any timepoint only a few of them are visible the tab completion will do its job: <code>'cd ~/w&lt;tab&gt;/s&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>"zzz"</code> might seem strange but is convenient: the letters “zzz” symbolically mark the projects within as being in a “sleeping” state while the 3 “z” letters in a row make sure that this folder is always placed at the very end of your active project list.
A nice folder structure is still maintained in the archive but for the ease of access all active folders are layed flat under the <code>~/work/</code> directory.
When the project is paused or completed it is moved to its place within the <code>"zzz"</code> hierarchy, maintaining the previous structure.
There is one extra benefit - contents of the <code>"work"</code> directory act as a reminder about all the projects that are in progress.
If necessary a to-do list with concrete details might be placed at the same level.</p>

<p>And just like that, like a newbie, I navigate the file system with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> again.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Computer vision is an incredibly fast growing field, and recent developments have made it possible to quickly start experimenting with almost no previous experience. In this post we’ll show you how to set up a practical computer vision analytic system using the $99 Nvidia Jetson Nano Developers Kit, running OpenDataCam. With OpenDataCam we can recognise, track and count people and a variety of vehicles from a USB webcam feed. We will send the collected data to InfluxDB for visualization and analysis, and set up the Jetson Nano for remote operation and management using a cellular modem and a Hologram SIM.<br></p><p>The video below shows a recording of a live field test I did outside a filling station, counting vehicles and pedestrians travelling in different directions.<br></p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/bjrMs8JFYdo">https://youtu.be/bjrMs8</a><br></p><p>To get started, you will need the following hardware:</p><ul role="list"><li>Jetson Nano Developers kit</li><li>5V 4A Power Supply with barrel connector</li><li>Micro SD Card, class 10 or better, 64 GB recommended</li><li>Wi-Fi adaptor (<a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15449">Edimax N150</a> or <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15841">Intel 8265.NGWMG M.2 card</a> recommended) or Ethernet cable</li><li>USB Webcam</li><li>4G Modem - USB or Raspberry Pi Hat (Tested with D-Link DWM-222)</li><li>Hologram SIM Card</li><li>HDMI monitor</li><li>USB Mouse and Keyboard</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2c5dacd16d7c48f0c455f9_20200724_143026.jpg" alt=""></p></figure><h2>How to set up the Nvidia Jetson Nano<br></h2><p>The Nvidia Jetson Nano is a powerful little single board computer with a GPU for running neural networks to do things like image classification, object detection or speech processing. It’s size and low cost means that it’s perfect for edge computing applications like retail analytics or various industrial uses. Combined with a cellular modem and USB webcam, it allows for quick and easy remote deployments, with the only field requirement being a power supply.<br></p><p>The Jetson Nano has no shortage of documentation and online resources, with Nvidia really having put effort into making machine learning approachable for almost anyone. It’s possible to get a basic object demo running in <a href="https://news.developer.nvidia.com/realtime-object-detection-in-10-lines-of-python-on-jetson-nano/">10 lines of python code</a>.</p><ol role="list"><li>Download the latest <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads">SD card image</a> for the Jetson Nano</li><li>Flash the image to the SD Card from your computer. On a Windows PC I prefer <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">BalenaEtcher</a>. If you haven’t done this before, complete instructions are on the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write">Nvidia website</a>.</li><li>If you're using the barrel socket power supply, place a jumper on the J48 pins, just behind the barrel socket. This deactivates the micro USB port as a power supply.</li><li>Insert the micro SD card into the slot on the Nano</li><li>Plug in the power supply, mouse, keyboard, and Wi-Fi adaptor or network cable<br></li></ol><p>The Jetson should now start up, and direct you through the system and network configuration, and login credentials set up. On the user setup page select the “Log in automatically” to allow all services to start without user intervention.<br></p><p>Once done, you should see the desktop. Open a terminal window and do the following:</p><p>Check for updates, and update all packages. This might take a while.</p><p><code>
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>Install the Nano text editor and curl</p><p><code>
sudo apt install nano curl
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>For deployment a cellular connection is really convenient, but for testing and initial setup and ethernet or WiFi connection is quicker to set up. If you are using a Wi-Fi adaptor for testing, disable Wi-Fi power management to improve connection stability.</p><p><code>
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf
</code></p><p>‍</p><p>It will open a file with the following file</p><p><code>
[connection]
wifi.powersave = 3
</code></p><p>Disable Wi-Fi power saving by changing <strong>3</strong> to <strong>2</strong>.<br></p><p>‍</p><p>Get the IP address of your Jetson Nano by running</p><p><code>
ifconfig
</code></p><p>Restart the Jetson before continuing. Any command line operation from this point forward can be done either directly on the Nano with the keyboard, mouse and monitor, or you can use SSH from any computer on the same network.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you have a running Nano, it’s time to jump into the computer vision software.<br></p><h2>How to Install OpenDataCam</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam">OpenDataCam</a> is an open source tool for computer vision analytics, that can track and count objects in almost any video feed. It is probably the easiest to use and setup tool that I have seen for this purpose. It is licensed under the permissive MIT license, which allows for use in commercial products.</p><p>‍<br>OpenDataCam runs on the Docker platform, and requires access to CUDA, Nvidia’s tool for running parallel processing tasks on GPUs. First we need to make sure CUDA is defined in the PATH on the Nano, by editing the <em>.bashrc</em> file</p><p><code>
sudo nano .bashrc
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Add the following two lines to the end of the file, then save and close it.</p><p><code>
export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda/lib64
</code></p><p>Increase swap partition size of the Jetson to 6 GB to improve performance and reliability</p><p><code>
git clone https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/installSwapfile
cd installSwapfile
chmod 777 installSwapfile.sh
./installSwapfile.sh
</code></p><p>‍<br></p><p>Install Docker-compose and dependencies</p><p><code>
sudo apt install -y python3-pip libssl-dev libffi-dev python-openssl
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
</code></p><p>Allow docker to run on startup</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable docker
</code></p><p>Install OpenDataCam. You will be asked for your sudo password during this process, and it may take a while.</p><p><code>
mkdir ~/opendatacam
cd ~/opendatacam
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/v3.0.1/docker/install-opendatacam.sh
chmod 777 install-opendatacam.sh
./install-opendatacam.sh --platform nano
</code></p><h2>How to configure OpenDataCam</h2><p>Once the installation is complete, open Chromium and go to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network. Once OpenDataCam has started, you will see the following video feed. It is a demo file included in OpenDataCam and demonstrates its object detection capabilities. We’ll use this as an example to get familiar with the interface before changing the video feed for our specific use case.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889973b49b0b09f6e922_UFzR3FTem-uv1i--ef_6ImhdEpBDpt2KfhSRH-nKZV0pb-fzcXfRg8O0PQY3TbOj2PztqHk-4w3Vd2TxSfclRoaW-4s2Y4LzfuUgjATLtWqQF4bczSNDX8J6xo4QGwdqlm1tRpqq.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Click on the “Pathfinder” button in the upper left corner, and you will see the “tracks” generated by each car as it’s identified and tracked.<br></p><p>To count the vehicles, click the “Counter” button to add counting lines as shown below. These lines act as checkpoints, counting objects that pass over them. In the example below, I’ve added lines for oncoming, leaving, and crossing traffic. You can also toggle the direction of travel for objects to be counted, by clicking on the arrow in the centre of the line. To start counting, click the “Start recording” button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298899354fcf9d9df68f0d_GLWKyNi1Xs8Jq7lWGDHkCKCNnvh9syNBk2Lk-1gC1OEQEvHgJEs21VJ8oPYtk1Wc-nbns8Kj_GdcqaA25lKE2UaPU82ZRAQzUcFRCuBuUh23XW0RZsZaK3c3CIqIKH6-UhMRzuhd.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>To increase the reliability of the counters, it is important to place them in areas with high detection confidence. By clicking the hamburger menu in the upper right-hand corner, you can activate the tracker accuracy heatmap, which will highlight the areas with the <strong>lowest</strong> detection confidence levels.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f2988983b96a20a4ae37c21_D6BXJhyf_Dj-V7Ee6Xfa5q2Np7CTB_E5WITOkrOwuLSi73JBZjK2gWLf5Iz36E1Bn71D6-om6ao_-lE2HugxczT_NT_y0ojc_2DHNJGRQnvQ3adJOsHddTUM8LhB3z7tXt8GVYzL.png" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889972d197251894544b_BuLB_wQ_upuv3Vg3rZMNuyXJmQ0GNx0UyaJB5cmIJ-uJbQEcKPVdKE56PmnNvJBW_ft_Dl2oio5QcaScWLRZoK506Yx-L4BfFnNc8uAo4cmMGXlW1jBLDMBAA_D5DD02V-ZifngK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This means that you should avoid these areas when placing counting lines. It might also be a good idea to move the camera to a different perspective, or even improve the detection model using <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/training-yolo-for-object-detection-in-pytorch-with-your-custom-dataset-the-simple-way-1aa6f56cf7d9">transfer learning</a>.<br></p><p>If you have a sample video file that you want to test, you can simply drag and drop it into the OpenDataCam window and it will start playing the new file.<br></p><p>To use a webcam or IP camera stream, you need to <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">edit the config.json</a> file in ~/opendatacam/ to specify the desired video source. Complete details are available on the <a href="https://github.com/opendatacam/opendatacam/blob/master/documentation/CONFIG.md#video-input">OpenDataCam Github page</a>, including all the other settings you can change. For now will stick to the demo file while we link all the different parts of the project together, and I will describe the final setup I did for deployment at the end of the post.</p><p>To load and updated config file, restart the Docker container</p><p><code>
sudo docker-compose restart
</code></p><h2>How to Install Node-RED for Cloud Data Collection and Analysis</h2><p>I want to collect traffic data in set intervals and store it for analysis. InfluxDB is a database solution built specifically for time series data, which is exactly what we get from OpenDataCam. It also has some built-in visualisation tools. You can install and run InfluxDB locally on the Jetson, but in a production environment we will likely have multiple sources of data, so sending it to the cloud for analysis makes more sense.<br></p><p>OpenDataCam provides a simple but effective <a href="https://opendatacam.github.io/opendatacam/apidoc/">API </a>for interacting with it and extracting data, but we need to create a simple app to do this. I’ll be using Node-RED, flow-based GUI wrapper for Node.js, which also allows us to see at a glance how data flows through the app, and quickly make changes</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f298898cf4cb2839161f831_wUmPP-WAF2sNZpv2qt-pTAv6j4twJzsVmUR3MPQSDpX9roRV8JLq8PxcGqSejBnJc7z-RTxFWb7XIFEDAJNGIBgcPjBmHh4DDmMNuapQ3jL2agcDopb5UghwI4yRnsSB_TFLrEIp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The above screenshot gives you a good idea of how the flow works. First it checks the status of OpenDataCam (ODC), and starts it if it is not running yet, and if no recording is active, it starts one. If a recording is running, it retrieves the recording and then stop it, and immediately starts a new recording. The data from the completed recording is retrieved, and sent to InfluxDB.<br></p><p>This process is repeated at intervals set in the blue <em>timestamp</em> inject node. The dark green nodes provide output for debugging purposes.<br></p><p>To install Node-RED, open a terminal on your Jetson, and run:</p><p><code>
bash (curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/node-red/linux-installers/master/deb/update-nodejs-and-nodered)
</code></p><p>Install additional nodes for easy interaction with InfluxDB</p><p><code>
cd ~/.node-red &amp;&amp; npm install node-red-contrib-stackhero-influxdb-v2
</code></p><p>We want to let Node-RED start automatically when the Jetson starts</p><p><code>
sudo systemctl enable nodered.service
</code></p><p>Start Node-RED as a background service</p><p><code>
node-red-start
</code></p><p>Open the Node-RED UI by going to <em>localhost:1880</em> from the Jetson, or <em>*JetsonIP*:1880</em> from any computer on the same network.</p><p>To import the flow, click the menu icon in the upper right corner, and select <em>Import</em>.</p><p>Copy the flow code from this <a href="https://github.com/CuriousMongoose/opendatacam-nodered-influxdb/blob/master/nodered-flow.json">GitHub repo</a>, paste it into the import window, and click <em>Import</em>. The flow will now show in your Node-RED editor. Before we can deploy it, we need to set up InfluxDB to receive data, and get its authentication details.</p><h2>How to configure InfluxDB Cloud</h2><p>Now we need to set up a InfluxDB instance to receive the data. First go to the <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-cloud/">InfluxDB Cloud page</a>, register for a free account, and create an instance on the cloud platform of your choice. I used AWS.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d716c2c4df04f586b7912e3/5f29889817f6f13ef9861283_iy66hKVJonggHuEE97zGCmEVwrBnvAR0HzJKug2-sTenFZKkAqmzCzpErKJZ_FLEBe6JGaS8v3kr9Kg05pUCwDJKJtK-cwoFw27Jr4ULD90M90_tiYSn5X5kffZhbMXp1udSCsFR.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Once the instance is created and you are logged in, go to the <em>Buckets</em> tab on the <em>Dat…</em></p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Secrets in version control systems (VCS) like git is the current state of the world <strong>despite widely being recognized as a bad practice</strong>. Once source code enters a git repository, it can organically spread into multiple locations. This includes any secrets that may be included within. But why then are secrets in git repositories so common? </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p><em>This is the second in a series of articles about secrets within source code and will look specifically at why secrets within git repositories is such a plague, why it is so dangerous and how to prevent it. </em></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="1"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-end-up-in-git">Why secrets end up in git</h2><p>A seasoned developer may be scratching their heads wondering why anyone may put secrets inside a git repository. <strong>But the fact is, secrets inside git repositories is the current state of the world. </strong></p><p><a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/secret-sprawl/">Last article</a> we talked about how it is common to choose the path of least resistance when it comes to accessing and distributing secrets. <strong>Git acts as the central point of truth for a project</strong>, so it makes sense, at least from a convenience point of view, that secrets are stored inside a private git repository to make distribution and access easy. </p><blockquote>But storing secrets like this is playing with fire, it only takes a very small incident to get burnt. </blockquote><p>In addition to intentionally storing secrets in git, <strong>when secrets are not managed properly, it is very easy to lose track of them</strong>. Secrets may be hardcoded into source code, stored as text file, shared over Slack or buried inside a debug application log. In addition, developers can be in large distributed teams with access to a plethora of secrets while being faced with reduced release cycles and an ever growing number of technologies to master. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="2"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="why-secrets-in-git-is-dangerous">Why secrets in git is dangerous</h2><p>Source code, we have to remember, is very leaky. Code is copied and transferred everywhere. Git is designed in a way that allows, even promotes, code to be freely distributed. </p><p>Projects can be cloned onto multiple machines, forked into new projects, &nbsp;distributed to customers, made public so on and so forth. <strong>Each time it’s duplicated on git, the entire history of that project is also duplicated.</strong></p><p>Why storing secrets in public repositories is bad will be obvious. They are freely available to everyone on the internet and it is very easy to monitor public repositories, GitHub has a public API to fetch all public commits for example. <br></p><p><strong>But what about private git repositories?</strong><br></p><p>Private repositories don’t publish your source code to the internet openly, but it doesn’t have adequate protection to store such sensitive information either. <strong>Imagine if there was a plain text file with all your credit card numbers within it, you hopefully wouldn’t put this into the companies git repository, secrets are just as sensitive. </strong></p><p><strong>A few things to consider when storing secrets in private repositories:</strong></p><ul><li>Everyone in the organization with access to the repo has access to the secrets within (one compromised account can provide an attacker access to a trove of secrets).</li><li>Repositories can be cloned onto multiple machines or forked into new projects.</li><li>Private repositories can be made public which can have secrets buried in the git history.</li></ul><p>Another important consideration is that <em><strong>code removed from a git repository is never actually gone.</strong></em></p><p>Git keeps track of all changes that are made. Code that is removed - or more technically correct: code that is committed over - still exists within the git history.</p><p>Interestingly enough, code is removed from a project at near equal volume that is added. This means that the code within repositories are much deeper than the first layer and secrets could be buried deep within the git history under a mass of commits that have been long forgotten. </p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/iPPNU4jrj_CRg3G1zdZ8dFranXUHL7uDUvUk3c3IoLgp-Ub4iNPrpxe8JGjXBl1ntarRIy1Izu5FByy8OFzOOQr8gQA5OCnnvaG_p20IOPQQmaDpHX2LyLJ6IRI0laPFlIs-Ez0O" alt="git history added files and deleted files"><figcaption>git contributions graph</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency"><em>https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/graphs/code-frequency</em></a><em> </em><br></p><blockquote>Comment: The contributions graph that you see above from HashiCorp Vault repository is a typical view of a project's history.

Attackers are constantly exploiting personal services through secret keys too. In one example, <strong>bad actors scanned GitHub for AWS keys and used them to mine cryptocurrency, leaving <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots/">developers with thousands of dollars in debt</a></strong>.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[RESEARCH IN PROGRESS] We "forgot" to hide AWS keys in the code of a public repo on <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> .

</figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><hr id="4"><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="detecting-secrets-in-reviews-or-not-">Detecting secrets in reviews (or not)</h2><p>One great advantage of git is to be able to quickly and clearly see changes made and compare previous and proposed code states. It’s therefore common to believe that if secrets are leaked in source code, they of course will be detected within a code review or in a pull request.</p><blockquote>Code reviews are great for detecting logic flaws, maintaining good coding practices and keeping code quality high. But they are not adequate protection for detecting secrets. </blockquote><p>This is because reviews generally only consider the net difference between the current and proposed state. Not the entire history of a branch. Branches are commonly cleaned before being merged into the master branch, temporary code is added then deleted, unnecessary files added then removed.. But now these files, which are high risk candidates for containing secrets, are not visible to the reviewer (unless they want to go through the entire history of a branch). <br></p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XZOq-SU3EwpmQM6YEo52h7jk1vUM99PL-IJSs5wbRfioPpiAqIl8Ss2zm6MhZPWGLQ8bv_52YMcMB-qPGhb98e0b52cYMNJQYJB8-FXTE1URxxa9g5_2gpwmqT2iqySjDYXhrfCe" alt="Looking for secrets in git history"><figcaption>Git code review diagram</figcaption></figure><p>Let's walk through the example above. While this is over simplified it tells a familiar story. </p><p><br>Commit B a file named main.py is added. A new branch is created to add a new function to main.py in commit C, this feature uses an API key so to save time for testing this is hardcoded. Once the feature is working the hardcoded API key is replaced with an env variable and the file is cleaned. Finally a pull request is made and accepted because the reviewer looks at the net difference between commit B and D, ignoring commit C. Now undetected secrets are buried in the git history of the project.</p><p>While this scenario is very basic, add in hundreds of commits and files between master and a development branch and you can see how easy it is to miss secrets in code reviews. </p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wow.

While automation is not always the answer, detecting secrets, in particular secrets inside git, automated secrets detection is a clear solution to this widespread problem. </p><p>Unfortunately detecting secrets in git is not quite as easy as it first seems because of the probabilistic nature of secrets.

A great dashboard with native GitHub and GitLab integrations, a CLI tool called <a href="https://github.com/GitGuardian/gg-shield">GG-Shield</a> or you can even build custom your own git secrets scanner using the <a href="https://api.gitguardian.com/">GitGuardian API</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>Let’s have a quick review of what we have gone through. Git repositories are very common places to find secrets and they remain the perfect incubator for secrets to sprawl into multiple locations. Git keeps a track of a project's history which can be deep making finding secrets difficult. Because of the workflow git creates, it is common for any secrets to be missed during manual checking procedures and automated secrets detection should be introduced into the SDLC.</p><p>Curious of how secrets detection works? Next episode in the secrets in source code series we are going to dive into the mechanics of secrets detection including why probabilistic algorithms are so tricky and the secret sauce behind making them work.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->

        <p><span>E</span>ven though mathematicians have spent over 2,000 years dissecting the structure of the five Platonic solids—the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron—thereâ€™s still a lot we donâ€™t know about them.<br></p>

<p>Now, a trio of mathematicians has resolved one of the most basic questions about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Suppose you stand at one of the corners of a Platonic solid. Is there some straight path you could take that would eventually return you to your starting point without passing through any of the other corners? For the four Platonic solids built out of squares or equilateral triangles—the cube, tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron—mathematicians&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012365X16302254?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">figured out</a>&nbsp;that the answer is no. Any straight path starting from a corner will either hit another corner or wind around forever without returning home. But with the dodecahedron, which is formed from 12 pentagons, mathematicians didnâ€™t know what to expect.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jathreya/" target="_blank">Jayadev Athreya</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://userhome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/aulicino/" target="_blank">David Aulicino</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/people?name=Pat_Hooper" target="_blank">Patrick Hooper</a>&nbsp;have shown that an infinite number of such paths do in fact exist on the dodecahedron. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10586458.2020.1712564" target="_blank">paper</a>, published in May 2020&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Experimental Mathematics,</em>&nbsp;shows that these paths can be divided into 31 natural families.</p>
<p>The solution required modern techniques and computer algorithms. â€œTwenty years ago, [this question] was absolutely out of reach; 10 years ago it would require an enormous effort of writing all necessary software, so only now all the factors came together,â€� wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~anton.zorich/" target="_blank">Anton Zorich</a>, of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris, in an email.</p>
<p>The project began in 2016 when Athreya, of the University of Washington, and Aulicino, of Brooklyn College, started playing with a collection of card stock cutouts that fold up into the Platonic solids. As they built the different solids, it occurred to Aulicino that a body of recent research on flat geometry might be just what theyâ€™d need to understand straight paths on the dodecahedron. â€œWe were literally putting these things together,â€� Athreya said. â€œSo it was kind of idle exploration meets an opportunity.â€�<br></p>
<p>Together with Hooper, of the City College of New York, the researchers figured out how to classify all the straight paths from one corner back to itself that avoid other corners.</p>
<p>Their analysis is â€œan elegant solution,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/~masur/" target="_blank">Howard Masur</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago. â€œItâ€™s one of these things where I can say, without any hesitation, â€˜Goodness, oh, I wish I had done that!â€™â€�</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Symmetries</strong></p>
<p>Although mathematicians have speculated about straight paths on the dodecahedron for more than a century, thereâ€™s been a resurgence of interest in the subject in recent years following gains in understanding â€œtranslation surfaces.â€� These are surfaces formed by gluing together parallel sides of a polygon, and theyâ€™ve proved useful for studying a wide range of topics involving straight paths on shapes with corners, from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-shapes-solve-infinite-pool-table-problem-20170808/" target="_blank">billiard table trajectories</a>&nbsp;to the question of&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2975" target="_blank">when a single light</a>&nbsp;can illuminate an entire mirrored room.</p>
<p>In all these problems, the basic idea is to unroll your shape in a way that makes the paths you are studying simpler. So to understand straight paths on a Platonic solid, you could start by cutting open enough edges to make the solid lie flat, forming what mathematicians call a net. One net for the cube, for example, is a T shape made of six squares.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_b5cfddf2f49d5db00b5bd785f76c12dc.jpg" alt="nautilus paper dodecahed"><figcaption><span>A paper dodecahedron constructed in 2018 by David Aulicino and Jayadev Athreya to show that straight paths from a vertex back to itself while avoiding other vertices are in fact possible. </span><br><span>Patrick Hooper</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine that weâ€™ve flattened out the dodecahedron, and now weâ€™re walking along this flat shape in some chosen direction. Eventually weâ€™ll hit the edge of the net, at which point our path will hop to a different pentagon (whichever one was glued to our current pentagon before we cut open the dodecahedron). Whenever the path hops, it also rotates by some multiple of 36 degrees.<br></p>
<p>To avoid all this hopping and rotating, when we hit an edge of the net we could instead glue on a new, rotated copy of the net and continue straight into it. Weâ€™ve added some redundancy: Now we have two different pentagons representing each pentagon on the original dodecahedron. So weâ€™ve made our world more complicated—but our path has gotten simpler. We can keep adding a new net each time we need to expand beyond the edge of our world.</p>
<p>By the time our path has traveled through 10 nets, weâ€™ve rotated our original net through every possible multiple of 36 degrees, and the next net we add will have the same orientation as the one we started with. That means this 11th net is related to the original one by a simple shift—what mathematicians call a translation. Instead of gluing on an 11th net, we could simply glue the edge of the 10th net to the corresponding parallel edge in the original net. Our shape will no longer lie flat on the table, but mathematicians think of it as still â€œrememberingâ€� the flat geometry from its previous incarnation—so, for instance, paths are considered straight if they were straight in the unglued shape. After we do all such possible gluings of corresponding parallel edges, we end up with what is called a translation surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/abstractions_14ff01eeeec2fbef4da8d0a223f2a3e2.jpg" alt="nautilus arthreya"><figcaption><span>Athreyaâ€™s right arm bears a tattoo of his favorite translation surface — a double pentagon. </span><br><span>Radhika Govindrajan</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The resulting surface is a highly redundant representation of the dodecahedron, with 10 copies of each pentagon. And itâ€™s massively more complicated: It glues up into a shape like a doughnut with 81 holes. Nevertheless, this complicated shape allowed the three researchers to access the rich theory of translation surfaces.<br></p>
<p>To tackle this giant surface, the mathematicians rolled up their sleeves—figuratively and literally. After working on the problem for a few months, they realized that the 81-holed doughnut surface forms a redundant representation not just of the dodecahedron but also of one of the most studied translation surfaces. Called the double pentagon, it is made by attaching two pentagons along a single edge and then gluing together parallel sides to create a two-holed doughnut with a rich collection of symmetries.</p>
<p>This shape also happened to be tattooed on Athreyaâ€™s arm. â€œThe double pentagon was something that I already knew and loved,â€� said Athreya, who got the tattoo a year before he and Aulicino started thinking about the dodecahedron.</p>
<p>Because the double pentagon and the dodecahedron are geometric cousins, the formerâ€™s high degree of symmetry can elucidate the structure of the latter. Itâ€™s an â€œamazing hidden symmetry,â€� said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~eskin/" target="_blank">Alex Eskin</a>&nbsp;of the University of Chicago (who was Athreyaâ€™s doctoral adviser about 15 years ago). â€œThe fact that the dodecahedron has this hidden symmetry group is, I think, quite remarkable.â€�</p>

</center>
<p>The relationship between these surfaces meant that the researchers could tap into an algorithm for analyzing highly symmetric translation surfaces developed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/iag3/~finster/en" target="_blank">Myriam Finster</a>&nbsp;of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany. By adapting Finsterâ€™s algorithm, the researchers were able to identify all the straight paths on the dodecahedron from a corner to itself, and to classify these paths via the dodecahedronâ€™s hidden symmetries.<br></p>
<p>The analysis was â€œone of the most fun projects Iâ€™ve gotten to work on in my whole career,â€� Athreya said. â€œItâ€™s important to keep playing with things.â€�</p>
<p>The new result shows that even objects that have been studied for thousands of years can still hold secrets, Eskin said. â€œI think even for [the three mathematicians], it was very, very surprising to say something new about the dodecahedron.â€�</p>

        <p>A story on Hacker News recently argued that webpage speeds haven't improved, even as internet speeds have gone up.</p>
<p>This article explains why that conclusion can't be drawn from the original data.</p>
<p>We'll also look at how devices and the web have changed over the past 10 years, and what those changes have meant for web performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/hn-article.png" alt="Webpage speeds article on Hacker News"></p>

</ol>
<h2 id="interpreting-the-http-archive-data">Interpreting the HTTP Archive data</h2>
<p>This chart from the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-need-for-speed/">Nielsen Norman Group article</a> suggested that increasing mobile network bandwidth hasn't resulted in faster page load times.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart.png" alt="Chart showing increasing bandwidth along increasing page load times"></p>
<p>However, <strong>the connection speed used by HTTP Archive has not actually increased over time.</strong></p>
<p>Instead it went down in 2013, <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#what-changes-have-been-made-to-the-test-environment-that-might-affect-the-data">switching from wifi to an emulated 3G connection</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/nngroup-mobile-webperf-chart-annotated.png" alt="Annotation for page loads time showing when methodology changed"></p>
<p>The onLoad metric has increased 55% since 2013, from 12.7s to 19.7s. If you bought a phone in 2013 and have been on a 3G connection ever since, then the web has become slower for you.</p>
<p>Before looking at how devices and the web have changed over the last 10 years, here are a few notes on how to think about this data.</p>
<h3 id="why-look-at-on-load">Why look at onLoad?</h3>
<p>The <code>load</code> event is emitted by the page when all page resources like scripts or images have been downloaded.</p>
<p>If the top of a page renders quickly, but the page also loads 20 images further down, then the onLoad metric will suggest that the page is slow.</p>
<p>A different page might not initially render anything useful at all, and only start loading additional resources and rendering content long after the onLoad event. Yet this page will appear fast.</p>
<p>As a result, onLoad doesn't do a good job measuring whether a user experiences the page as fast.</p>
<p>So why do we even look at this metric? <strong>Because it's been around for a long time</strong>, and HTTP Archive has been tracking it since 2010. Newer metrics like <a href="https://www.debugbear.com/docs/metrics/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> or Time to Interactive were only added to HTTP Archive in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="should-we-expect-increasing-bandwidth-to-result-in-faster-page-load-times">Should we expect increasing bandwidth to result in faster page load times?</h3>
<p>Increasing bandwidth will only make a page load faster if bandwidth is the bottleneck at some point. It won't help if you're on a Gigabit connection with a 1s network roundtrip time.</p>
<p>However, the 1.6Mbps 3G connection emulated by HTTP Archive is very slow, so we should expect significant performance improvements as bandwidth improves. The average website downloads 1.7MB of data in 2020, which will take at least 9s to download on the HTTP Archive connection.</p>
<h3 id="some-more-http-archive-caveats">Some more HTTP Archive caveats</h3>
<p>I'll talk a lot about "the average website" in this article. It's worth noting that HTTP Archive only collects data on homepages, not pages deeper down in the site. The corpus of tested domains has also grown over time.</p>
<p>The tests weren't always run on the same device. Initially a physical iPhone 4 was used, today the tests are run on an emulated Android device.</p>
<p>We'll look at median metric values in this article. If most websites are fast but one in five websites freeze your phone for 20s we won't be able to pick this up.</p>
<h3 id="performance-on-desktop">Performance on desktop</h3>
<p>This article will focus on mobile performance in the US. However, if you're looking at the desktop data from the original article, it's worth noting that the test bandwidth was increased and latency was reduced in 2013.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/desktop-performance.png" alt="Chart showing desktop connection speeds and when emulated connection speed changed"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-mobile-networks-and-devices-changed-over-the-last-10-years">How have mobile networks and devices changed over the last 10 years?</h2>
<p>Let's look at 4 factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>network bandwidth</li>
<li>network latency</li>
<li>processor speeds</li>
<li>browser performance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mobile-network-bandwidth-in-the-us">Mobile network bandwidth in the US</h3>
<p>This chart shows average mobile bandwidth in the US by year, according to different sources. It increased from 1 Mbps to around 30 Mbps.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-bandwidth.png" alt="Mobile bandwidth in the US by year"></p>
<p>(I've not been very careful when collecting this data. For example, I didn't consistently distinguish when data was collected from when it was published. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ifZ_ngADpT3YzezNQLpXKCsr74-BvaBJUkYm6PGpv1g/edit?usp=sharing">You can find my sources here</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="mobile-network-latency-in-the-us">Mobile network latency in the US</h3>
<p>This was harder to find data on, but the results indicate that latency dropped from around 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/us-mobile-latency.png" alt="Mobile latency in the US by year, going down from 200ms in 2011 to 50ms in 2020"></p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-cpu-speeds">Mobile device CPU speeds</h3>
<p>I've not been able to find data on average mobile device speeds in the US. But <a href="https://infrequently.org/">Alex Russel</a> and <a href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> have published a <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/1233275220275818498">chart showing GeekBench 4 scores alongside the release years of different phones</a>.</p>
<p>Even budget phones have become 4x faster, with iPhones now being up to 20x more powerful.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/mobile-cpu-benchmark.jpeg" alt="Mobile CPU performance over time"></p>
<h3 id="how-have-browsers-changed">How have browsers changed?</h3>
<p>A lot of work has been done on browsers over the last 10 years. JavaScript has become a larger part of the web, so many improvements have focussed here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/10-years">this chart from the V8 blog</a>, page CPU usage for gone down by a factor of 4.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/v8-performance.png" alt="V8 Speedometer 1 benchmark results 2013 to 2018"></p>
<h4 id="networking">Networking</h4>
<p>Browser networking has also improved, for example with the introduction of HTTP/2 in 2015. 64% of requests are now served over HTTP/2.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/http2.png" alt="HTTP/2 adoption over time"></p>
<h2 id="how-have-websites-changed">How have websites changed?</h2>
<p>Let's look at some data from HTTP Archive to see how websites have changed.</p>
<h3 id="page-weight">Page weight</h3>
<p><a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight">Mobile page weight</a> increased by 337% between 2013 and 2020. This is primarily driven by an increase in images and JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Other resources also increased a lot –&nbsp;I suspect these are mostly videos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/page-weight.png" alt="Page weight by resource type over time"></p>
<p>The chart starts in 2013 as HTTP Archive changed its methodology in October 2012. Before page weight was undercounted, as the test stopped when the page load event was triggered, even if more data was still being loaded.</p>
<h3 id="java-script-execution-time">JavaScript execution time</h3>
<p>JavaScript would be the most likely culprit if pages are getting slower despite faster mobile networks. Unfortunately, HTTP Archive only started collecting this data in late 2017, and it seems to have been mostly stable since then.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/javascript-execution-time.png" alt="HTTP Archive JavaScript execution time chart"></p>
<p>The drop in mid-2018 can probably be attributed to a URL corpus change.</p>
<p>Note that the absolute run duration (0.5s) is less than what you'd normally see in a tool like Lighthouse. These tools normally slow down JavaScript execution to emulate a mobile device, but <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#lighthouse">this was broken for the HTTP Archive tests</a>. So while this number might be realistic for mid-range phones, a common assumption is that budget phones are around 4x slower.</p>
<h2 id="answering-whether-the-web-has-become-slower">Answering whether the web has become slower</h2>
<p>Has the web become slower? Well, it depends on what your device, network connection, and most-used websites are.</p>
<p>We'd need to weigh real-world performance data to get a distribution that shows how different users experienced the web over time. And should the experience of someone opening thousands of pages a day count as much as someone who only visits Facebook once a week?</p>
<p>I don't have detailed per-user data, but we can take a look at the question in a few different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Real-user data from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report (CrUX)</a></li>
<li>Naive modelling based on how websites and devices have changed</li>
</ol>
<p>I also tried downloading old page versions from archive.org and testing them with Lighthouse, but wasn't able to get meaningful results in the time I had available. For example, often some images are missing from the page archive.</p>
<h2 id="data-from-the-chrome-user-experience-report">Data from the Chrome User Experience Report</h2>
<p>The big limitation of CrUX data is that it's only been collected since late 2017. But we can still use it to see if the web has become slower in the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike HTTP Archive, CrUX looks at the whole domain instead of just homepages.</p>
<p>The data we'll look at is the 75th percentile, meaning pages load at least this fast for 75% of users.</p>
<p>(I'm taking the average across websites rather than the median, which is not great.)</p>
<h3 id="us-page-load-times">US page load times</h3>
<p>CrUX data for the US does not show page performance getting worse.</p>
<p>The onLoad metric shows a slight improvement, maybe due to an increase in bandwidth. Or maybe more activity is now happening after the initial page load.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-us.png" alt="Page load speeds in the US"></p>
<p>The paint metrics seem fairly stable. Largest Contentful Paint is a new metric that has only been collected since mid-2019.</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-the-world">The rest of the world</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the US onLoad metric is matched by the global data. There are however signifianct differences in page load times across countries, with onLoad timings in India being almost twice those in South Korea.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/crux-global.png" alt="Page load speeds globally, in the US, UK, Korea, and India"></p>
<p>We can use CrUX data to put HTTP Archive data into perspective. In January 2020 HTTP Archive reported a median (50% percentile) load time of 18.7s, based on its synthetic data.</p>
<p>In contrast, CrUX suggests a load time of just 5.8s –&nbsp;and this is the 75th percentile.</p>
<p>(Note that the Global values here just take an average and are not weighed by population.)</p>
<h2 id="modelling-page-load-times">Modelling page load times</h2>
<p>We can create a theoretical model of how changes in devices, networks, and websites might affect overall performance.</p>
<p>This won't be a great model, but hopefully it will still provide some insight.</p>
<h3 id="theoretical-page-download-time">Theoretical page download time</h3>
<p>Page weight has increased over time, but so has bandwidth. Round-trip latency has also gone down.</p>
<p>Downloading a file the size of the median mobile website would have taken 1.7s in 2013. If your connection hasn't improved since then downloading this much data would now take 4.4s. But with an average connection today it would only take 0.9s.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.debugbear.com/public/blog/is-the-web-getting-slower/minimum-page-download-time.png" alt="TCP download time"></p>
<p>In practice, a website wouldn't consist of just a single request, and other factors like CPU processing or server latency would also affect how quickly the page loads. The onLoad times reported by HTTP Archive are 2-3 times this lower bound.</p>
<p>But we can still use this as an indicator that reduced latency and increased bandwidth have helped make websites load faster overall.</p>
<p>(I'm starting in 2013 rather than 2011, as the HTTP Archive page weight metric has only been measured consistently since then.)</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>I'm not quite sure how to think about this, but I'll make some guesses anyway.</p>
<p>Someone who used a Galaxy S4 in 2013 and now uses a Galaxy S10 will have seen their CPU processing power go up by a factor of 5. Let's assume that browsers have become 4x more efficient since then. If we naively multiply these numbers we get an overall 20x improvement.</p>
<p>Since 2013, JavaScript page weight has increased 3.7x from 107KB to 392KB. Maybe minification and compression have improved a bit …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.

<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>MAE and RMSE are some of the most common error metrics for regression problems.</p>
<p>Despite being used for the same task (understanding the errors in your predictions) there are important differences between the two. Choosing the right metrics for your model can make a huge difference in your ability to solve a problem.</p>
<p>The algorithms you'll use to create models use the error metric to perform optimizations. Your choice of error metric will affect the final model and the way you evaluate its performance, so it's important to understand the difference between error metrics.</p>
<p>MAE and RMSE are both extremely common in practice, that's why we will talk about them in this article. Before starting, let's have a quick recap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A regression model is a model that predicts a continuous value. The most common way of training a regression model is using supervised learning: you have a set of examples with the 'right answers'. You use this training set to teach the model how to produce those answers with a set of inputs in the hopes of finding general rules you can apply outside of the training set.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="meanabsoluteerrormae">Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h2>
<p>The mean absolute error (MAE) is defined as the sum of the absolute value of the differences between all the expected values and predicted values, divided by the total number of predictions. In equation form, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/MAE.png" alt="MAE"></p>
<p>The expected values are the answers you already know that are part of the training, validation or test sets, and the predicted values are the results predicted by the model for such inputs.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you run your model on a validation set and get the following result:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Expected value</th>
<th>Predicted Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>19</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>37</td>
<td>32</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>48</td>
<td>43</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>33</td>
<td>21</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25</td>
<td>22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each row in the table represents a prediction and its associated expected value.</p>
<p>For example, in the first prediction, the right answer is 5, but our model predicted a 10, the prediction is off by 5. In the third prediction, our model predicted a 32, where the right answer is 37, the prediction is off by -5.</p>
<p>You can summarize this in another table with the results of the error for each prediction.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Expected value</th>
<th>Predicted Value</th>
<th>Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>5</td>

<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td>19</td>

<p>How do we calculate the mean absolute error?</p>
<p>Easy, just average the absolute value of the errors. With the data of our table, it would be like this:</p>
<p>MAE = (|5|+|8|+|-5|+|0|+|9|+|-5|+|-12|+|-3|+|3|)/9 = (5+8+5+0+9+5+12+3+3)/9 = 50/9 =~ 5.55</p>
<p>You might be wondering why we use absolute values. This is important to take into consideration the fact that we have two types of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The predicted value is lower than the expected value.</li>
<li>The predicted value is higher than the expected value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The absolute value ensures that both types contribute to the overall error. Without it, the positive and negative errors would cancel each other. This is bad: your regression model might perform terribly and still return a very low overall error.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, repeat the calculation for total error using the data in the table, but this time don't use the absolute values:</p>
<p>Total Error = (5 + 8+ -5 + 0 + 9 + -5 + -12 + -3 + 3)/9 = 0</p>
<p>Yes, a total value of 0 despite making several mistakes.</p>
<p>MAE is a very simple and useful metric for error, and now you know almost everything there is to know about it.</p>
<p>Let's talk about RMSE.</p>
<h2 id="rootmeansquareerrorrmse">Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE)</h2>
<p>RMSE is defined as the square root of the average of the squared errors. In equation form, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/RMSE.png" alt="RMSE"></p>
<p>Don't worry if that sounds a bit confusing, it's much easier to understand with an example. Let's calculate it, step by step, using the same error table from before.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1: Square the error values</strong></li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Error</th>
<th>Squared Error</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>64</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td>81</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-5</td>
<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-12</td>
<td>144</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-3</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 2: Sum the squared errors and divide the result by the number of examples (calculate the average)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>MSE = (25 + 64 + 25 + 0 + 81 + 25 + 144 + 9 + 9)/9 =~ 42.44</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3: Calculate the square root of the average</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>RMSE = square_root(42.44) =~ 6.51</p>
<p>Calculating both the MAE and RMSE is quite simple, and both summarize the total error as a single number. Now that we know how to calculate both, let's discuss their main differences and when to use each one.</p>
<h2 id="maeorrmse">MAE or RMSE?</h2>
<p>First, let's list the things they both have in common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both are used to measure the error produced by a predictive model.</li>
<li>Both are quick and easy to calculate.</li>
<li>Both summarize the error as a single numeric value that is easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the two metrics is the <strong>contribution of individual error values to the final result</strong>.</p>
<p>In the case of MAE, the contribution follows a linear behavior. This means that an error of 10 contributes twice as much as an error of 5. An error of 1000 contributes 10 times as much as an error of 100.</p>
<p>RMSE has a different behavior: due to the squaring operation, very small values ( between 0 and 1) become even smaller, and larger values become even larger. This means that big error values are magnified, whereas small ones are ignored.</p>
<p>If you were to plot the contribution of single values to the error in our example, MAE and RMSE would follow a behavior like the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.brainstobytes.com/content/images/2019/12/MAE_RMSE.png" alt="MAE_RMSE"></p>
<p>In brief, you want to use MAE for problems where the error gets worse linearly, like a model that predicts monetary loss. An error of $100 is twice as bad as an error of $50. MAE doesn't have a <em>predilection</em> for small errors or big errors.</p>
<p>RMSE is used when small errors can be safely ignored and big errors must be penalized and reduced as much as possible. RMSE gives much more importance to large errors, so models will try to minimize these as much as possible.</p>
<p>MAE and RMSE are both very simple and important concepts, and now you are another step ahead in your data science literacy.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In August, Veloren 0.7 was released! Airshipper, Veloren's launcher, also got
updated to 0.4.0. Veloren was featured in the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://rustgamedev.com/episodes/interview-with-team-veloren">Rust
Game Dev Podcast</a>. Although the 0.7 release party saw the
largest number of concurrent players at 57, it ran into some significant issues
which you can read about below.</p>
<p>The largest merge in Veloren so far also happened in August. It included
monumental changes to lighting and added level of detail functionality to see
far-off mountains. Lots of work has been done on the animation, combat, SFX, and
UX front. Animations for movement and combat were added and improved. Work
continued on particle systems, which have been added to Veloren in places like
campfires, fireworks, and weapons.</p>

<p>In September, work on 0.8 will continue. Some large systems being worked on
include networking, improved persistence stability, and player experience. Game
design is working on improving the connection between the experience a new
player has, and the current game design. The in-progress 0.8 version will likely
be completed more quickly than 0.7, as to not include too many changes.</p>

Egregoria was previously known as Scale,
but was renamed to fit the theme better.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://douady.paris/blog/egregoria_5.html">5th devlog</a> was published, talking about
the renaming, project management, buildings and scripting.</p>

<hr>
<p>When linking to a page for the <strong>purpose of reference</strong>, it seems better to me to <em><strong>link to the <a href="https://archive.org/">archive</a> of a given page</strong></em>, rather than to the original site itself.</p>
<p>This ensures that after some years have gone by, <strong>my article is guaranteed to be consistent</strong>. Due the  changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link could lead to a:</p>
<ul>
<li>404 /  Not Found (most common)</li>
<li>Changed or edited content, or entirely replaced content</li>
<li>Content that, due to a rise in popularity, is now shielded, demanding the user to make an account to read the entire article.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<p>Take defensive measures. To future-proof your content, rather than reference the general web, its far more reliable to link to an archive.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example:</h2>
<p>The Epoch Times wrote an article on Smartphones data-mining their users. This is the archived article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190214015500/https://www.theepochtimes.com/smartphone-app-users-are-data-mined-even-when-not-using-the-apps_2787202.html">The Archive Version (fully readable)</a></p>
<h3 id="article-content-before">Article Content Before</h3>
<p>You can see its perfectly “normal” readable useful  content.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-before.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<h3 id="article-content-after">Article Content After</h3>
<p>Now it’s spam from a site suffering financial need.</p>
<p><img src="https://hawaiigentech.com/post/commentary/why-i-link-to-waybackmachine-instead/link-content-after.png" alt="Article Link Content Before"></p>
<p>So in Feb 14 2019 your users would have seen the content you intended. However in Sep 07 2020, your users are being asked to support independent Journalism instead.</p>
<h2 id="if-an-archive-record-doesnt-exist-make-one">If an Archive Record Doesn't Exist, Make One</h2>
<p>Its worth the extra moment, in referencing a site, to make an archive of the page you wish to reference, if one does not exist. After that, immediately use the link from the archive.org entry, rather than the blog, news, info, or forum site you wish to refer to.</p>
<h2 id="in-unstable-times-take-measures-for-stability">In Unstable Times, Take Measures for Stability</h2>
<p>The web is a fast changing place. Even more during the Covid pandemic and suffering financial markets. Since times are financially harder, websites are disappearing, heaping up advertising, demanding user response, and things like this.</p>
<p>To avoid your content losing quality due to these things, linking to a solid, unchanging static copy of the page is far more reliable.</p>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-the-lessaudiogreater-tag">2. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>⁣<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element provides a way to add audio resources to a web page without the need to use any other plugin.⁣ It's used to play a sound much as music or an audio stream. It supports mp3, wav and ogg.
⁣
A fallback text is enclosed within the tag to be shown to browsers that don't support the element.⁣
⁣
By default, the browser does not show any controls. ⁣
To add the ability for users to play, pause, adjust volume, etc. the 'controls' attribute can be used.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>audio</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"music.mp4"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/mp4"</span>&gt;</span>

<p>By now, many people have run across the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016.pdf">Invisible Salamander</a> paper about the interesting property of AES-GCM, that allows an attacker to construct a ciphertext that will decrypt with a valid tag under two different keys, provided both keys are known to the attacker. On some level, finding properties like this isn’t too surprising: AES-GCM was designed to be an AEAD, and nowhere in the AEAD definition does it state anything about what attackers with access to the keys can do, since the usual assumption is that attackers don’t have that access, since any Alice-Bob-Message model would be meaningless in that scenario.</p>



<p>What is interesting to me is that this property comes up more often than one would think, I ran across it several times now during my work reviewing cryptographic designs, it’s far from an obscure property for real world systems. The general situation these systems have in common is that they involve three parties: Alice, Bob, and Trent. Trent is a trusted third party for Bob, who is allowed to read messages and scan them, with details like when and why depending on the crypto system in question. While Trent and Bob agree on the ciphertext<em>—</em>say because Trent hands Bob the ciphertext or because Alice presents Trent’s signature on it<em>—</em>Alice has the option of giving Trent and Bob different keys. The challenge for Alice is to come up with a ciphertext that has a valid authentication tag and still decrypts to different messages for Trent and Bob.</p>



<h4>Mitigations</h4>



<p>Before I dive deeper into how to construct invisible salamanders for AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV, a few words on how to defend against these problems. The easiest option here is to add a hash of the key to the ciphertext. This technically violates indistinguishability, as the identity of the key is leaked, i.e. an attacker now knows which key was used for the message. If indistinguishability is necessary, using the IV as a salt for the hash works well, constructions like <code>HMAC-SHA-2(key=IV, message=key)</code> (i.e. aka HKDF-expand) work well here, as long as attention is paid on whether or not this key hash can be used in any other context. In general, it shouldn’t because the key already should only be used for AES-GCM/AES-GCM-SIV, but real world systems sometimes have weird properties.</p>



<h4>Constructing Salamanders</h4>



<p>With the mitigation out of the way, onto the fun part: Constructing the messages. In order to understand why and how these attacks work, we first have to talk about <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> and the way AES-GCM and AES-GCM-SIV use this field to construct their respective tags. As a finite field <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{F}_{2^{128}}</span> supports addition, multiplication, and division, following the usual field axioms. The field has characteristic 2, which means addition is just the xor operator, and subtraction is the exact same operation as addition. Multiplication and division is somewhat more complicated and not in scope for this article, it suffices to say that multiplication can be implemented with a very fast algorithm if the hardware supports certain instruction sets (carryless multiplication). The division algorithm uses the Euclidean algorithm and will at most take 256 multiplications in a naive implementation, so while slower than the other operations, it will still be extremely fast. I will use <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> for the addition operation and <span data-katex-display="false">\cdot</span> for the multiplication operation. The most important caveat is to not confuse these operations with integer arithmetic.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM</h5>



<p>Next, on to <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf">AES-GCM</a>. This AEAD is a relatively straightforward implementation of an AEAD that uses a UHF based MAC for authentication. Our IV is 12 byte long, we use a 4 byte counter and CTR mode to encrypt the message. The slightly odd feature is that we start the counter at 2, for reasons we will see later. For authentication, we first derive an authentication key <span data-katex-display="false">H</span> by encrypting the zero block (This is why we don’t start the counter at zero, otherwise the zero IV would be invalid). Now, using the ciphertext blocks, additional data blocks (both padded with zeros as needed for the last block), and adding a special length block containing the size of the additional data and the ciphertext, we get a collection of blocks, all of which I will refer to as <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span>. To compute the tag, we now compute the polynomial</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H, C, T) = C_0\cdot H^{n+1} + C_1\cdot H^{n}+\dots + C_{n-1}\cdot H^2+C_n\cdot H+T</span></p><p>The constant term, <span data-katex-display="false">T</span> is the encrypted counter block associated to the counter variable of 1 (Which is why we started at 2 for the CTR mode). Remember that in characteristic 2 <span data-katex-display="false">+</span> is xor, so we could equivalently say that we compute the polynomial without the constant term and then encrypt it with CTR mode as the first block.</p>



<p>Now, how do we get two different plaintexts to agree on both ciphertext and tag, we first choose two keys and produce the corresponding keystreams, choosing the plaintexts so that the ciphertexts agree (If you want two plaintext that make sense, this part is the hardest step, you first brute force the first few bytes in order to be valid in one format and a comment opening statement in the other, so that you can switch which parts of the ciphertext will appear as valid plaintext and which parts appear as commented out). We leave one ciphertext block open for now, as a sacrificial block that we will modify in order to make the tags turn out to be the same. Next derive the corresponding authentication keys <span data-katex-display="false">H_1</span> and <span data-katex-display="false">H_2</span> and our constant terms <span data-katex-display="false">T_1, T_2</span>. This means, we have <span data-katex-display="false">C_i</span> fixed, except for a specific index, say <span data-katex-display="false">j</span>, and can now solve</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">GHASH(H_1, C, T_1) =GHASH(H_2, C, T_2)</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_1^{n+1-i}+T_1=\sum_{i=0}^n C_i\cdot H_2^{n+1-i}+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j\cdot\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)=\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2</span>



<span data-katex-display="true">C_j=\left(H_1^{n+1-j}+H_2^{n+1-j}\right)^{-1}\cdot\left(\sum_{\substack{i=0\\i\neq j}}^n C_i\cdot \left(H_1^{n+1-i}+H_2^{n+1-i}\right)+T_1+T_2\right)</span></p><p>by solving for the sacrificial block <span data-katex-display="false">C_j</span>.</p>



<h5>AES-GCM-SIV</h5>



<p>So far so good, but, what about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452">AES-GCM-SIV</a>? GCM is famous for having many weird properties that make it extremely fragile, like leaking the authentication key on a single IV reuse, or allowing for insecure tags smaller than 128 bits. In many ways, AES-GCM-SIV is how AES-GCM should look like for real world applications, much more robust against IV reuse, only revealing the damaging properties of an UHF with a reused IV if both IV and tag are the same. This is accomplished through using the tag as a synthetic IV, meaning the tag is computed over the plaintext, and then used as IV for CTR mode to encrypt. Even though this kind of SIV construction uses MAC-then-Encrypt, they are secure against the usual downsides due to CTR mode always succeeding in constant time, independent of the plaintext. This means the receiver can decrypt the message and validate the tag without revealing information about the plaintext in case of an invalid tag. The library needs to take care that the plaintext is properly discarded and not exposed to the user in case the tag does not validate.</p>



<p>The actual IV for AES-GCM-SIV is used primarily derive a per message key. This means that if the IV of two messages is different, both encryption and authentication keys will be unrelated and can not be used to infer things about each other.</p>



<p>All in all AES-GCM-SIV works like this:</p>



<ul><li><span data-katex-display="false">H, K_E = \operatorname{KDF}(K, IV)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">T=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, P_0\cdot H^{n+1}+\dots+P_n\cdot H)</span></li><li><span data-katex-display="false">C=\operatorname{AES-CTR}(K_E, IV=T)</span></li></ul>



<p>where the plaintext blocks <span data-katex-display="false">P_i</span> again contain additional data and length, and some extra hardening and efficiency tricks having been stripped for clarity.</p>



<p>Our previous approach of first creating the ciphertext and then balancing things out to get the tags to agree clearly cannot work here anymore. The keystream, and therefore the ciphertext, depend on the tag, so if we want to have any chance of finding a salamander, we have to fix the tag before we do any calculation at all. So after having chosen <span data-katex-display="false">T</span>, we decrypt it under each of our keys to get the result of our polynomial <span data-katex-display="false">S_i=\operatorname{AES}^{-1}(K_{E,i}, T)</span>. What we are left with is finding plaintexts <span data-katex-display="false">P_1, P_2</span> such that</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">S_i=\sum_{j=0}^n P_{j, i} H_i^{n+1-j}</span></p><p>which gives us a system of two linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> unknowns. But this isn’t all constraints we need to satisfy, since we still need to encrypt these plaintexts once we have the tag balanced. Here, we are lucky that everything is over characteristic 2: The CTR encryption is just an addition of the plaintext and the encrypted counter block <span data-katex-display="false">C_i=\operatorname{AES}(K_E, CB_i)+P_i</span>. To say that two plaintexts result in the same ciphertext under two different keys is just fulfilling the equation</p>



<p><span data-katex-display="true">\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 1}, CB_{j, 1})+P_{j, 1}=\operatorname{AES}(K_{E, 2}, CB_{j, 2})+P_{j, 2}</span>.</p>



<p>This, like our two equations for the tag, is a linear equation. So in the end, for a plaintext that has a size of <span data-katex-display="false">n</span> blocks, we get <span data-katex-display="false">n+2</span> linear equations with <span data-katex-display="false">2n</span> variables. This means, in almost all cases, we can construct an invisible salamander with only adding two sacrificial blocks, with the same caveat that the two plaintexts need to be partially brute forced.</p>



<h4>Test Code</h4>



<p>I’ve put this to the test and have written code to produce <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/FunWithGcm.java">AES-GCM</a> (Java) and <a href="https://github.com/sophieschmieg/fun-with-gcm/blob/master/fun_with_gcm_siv.cc">AES-GCM-SIV</a> (C++) salamanders.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Anyone with any programming experience understands that computers are deterministic machines. If you provide the same input, you’ll always get the same output. That’s why having computers generate something by chance is trickier than it may seem.</p>
<p>Computers use random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling, generative algorithms, video games, and more. However, computers are inherently incapable of being random. Instead, programmers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). These are simply a category of algorithms that programmatically generate new random numbers from a given starting value called the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These algorithms are not without their own limitations. Since the random numbers are programmatically generated, if someone were able to identify the seed value and the PRNG algorithm you were using, they’d be able to predict the next random number in the sequence. This would allow an attacker to break encryption, predict the next playing card in a sequence, cheat in a video game, etc. </p>
<p>Despite this concern, PRNGs are extremely useful in situations involving modeling and simulations as it allows you to “replay” a series of random events by initializing your random number generator with the same seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations where the randomness of the random numbers is critical, we use a “true” random number generator (TRNGs). Unlike PRNGs that have an arbitrary seed value, TRNGs pick a seed value from their environment / external data. </p>
<p>Here are a few potential options:</p>
<ul><li>Mouse movements</li><li>Fan noise</li><li>Atmospheric pressure</li><li>Number of microseconds since the last whole second</li></ul>
<p>We just need to pick a seed that an attacker wouldn’t be able to predict. This seed value will then be passed into an algorithm, similar to PRNGs, that will generate a random number to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case will generally dictate whether a PRNG will suffice or if a “true” RNG is needed. Regardless, it’s important to understand the practical differences between both approaches. </p>
<p>PRNGs are faster than TRNGs and their determinism is extremely useful in cases where you want to replay a series of “random” events. Additionally, some PRNGs are periodic in nature, but modern PRNGs with the right initialization parameters have a period long enough that it’s not a major concern. Conversely, TRNGs are slower than PRNGs, are non-deterministic, and are not periodic.</p>
<h2>Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at implementing a simple PRNG. We’ll implement a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG) algorithm. LCG was previously one of the most commonly used and studied PRNGs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">more info</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the recurrence relation for LCG:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNcDHvHA6BvD1fpYntUkZ-11dzW6EYoW5dHv7mMhPZhDNo5fJaIMZXUh7SmZq0AoobvHxg7K5MMvqoWav7ee0xHase0fhAjWmNWoW7RcT5GzAao1jVwtGY11q2yL6iuvWiYFgyHS" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Wikipedia page on LCG</a> documents a few commonly used values for modulus, multiplier, and increment. There’s no consensus on the best values to use hence the differing values across implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be mindful of what values we use for these parameters. Choosing the wrong values can create a period that is too short which would render our random number generator useless. </p>
<p>In the image below, you can see that small changes to our parameters can greatly impact the period length.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FVum2kuYt4oMYjOdzHx2txpQH0NgheDDSUSxyQJamzGbZgPcUALt3Mmv4H-BElodwXwTzcLaqicG8IdsPFAgolV4DK8NkZXtghDQ_hX6MyMsxU_irWeOxR1ijaoYgecOU3fbuPbQ" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>For our implementation, we’ll use the values documented in previous standards of the C languages (C90/C99/ANSI C,&nbsp; and C11).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>a = 1103515245</code></p>
<p><code>m = 2³¹</code></p>
<p><code>c = 12345</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever PRNG algorithm you choose should result in a uniform distribution of random numbers and a sufficiently long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple implementation in Swift:</p>

<h2>Simulating Dice Rolls</h2>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to simulate a dice roll. </p>
<p>It might seem reasonable to change the modulus to 6, but this would create a period far too short to be usable. We need to stick with well-chosen and tested values for our parameters. </p>

<p>Instead, using the approach in the code above, we can simulate 10,000 dice rolls:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVT2lMlmWHcYIio5WmgkMMXz9nkkA_P4lzIVWeyVETxasCDn5s_5qQWgBh5FAvfPDwHipyMaqHWmb_lOp_J7oOXiRdxo_3lywqvrIo4Ky40QoDUYIrJ15w5mC6B9XWVLWvyySRWr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Dice Value: 10,000 Roll Simulations</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the results, we can see that it is indeed a uniform distribution of values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Generating Random Numbers In A Range</h2>
<p>Next, let’s consider generating random numbers that fall in a range. Again, we shouldn’t change our parameters without fully understanding how it affects the period. </p>
<p>Instead, we should map our PRNG’s results to values in our desired range.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A2h_s4Z_eN-qGkjEZabgPwWpOjMmIDdD9fQlYcdM344voNTlxPIvammtm6RRXJ6aDgG83h67zZYf4E4olN7jz5VRiIK10D_XeRTf0whcfHLZhn8Q9142vJBZU9Ma40DIvFVw7FdU" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>After a million simulations across the specified range [30, 80)</p>
<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators">more modern PRNGs</a>, I’d recommend exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> approach. It’s currently the most popular PRNG algorithm and currently used in Python (numpy), Ruby, PHP, R, and C++.&nbsp;</p>

In general, there are a variety of options that are commonly used to implement this type of requirements, which typically fall into two categories: <br>1). Two separate UIs (one public app and the other one only accessible by admins)<br>2). Restrict the application pages/sections based on the users’ permissions.</p><p id="6c6a">I recently came across a situation while implementing a health care web application, where we had a bunch of UI components that were intended to be utilized from both medical personnel (admins) views as well as from the patients’ UI, so the second approach of the aforementioned ones made the most sense in that case.</p><p id="101d">One important issue we happen to have, however, was that even though we’ve got a lot of generic React components to be used across the entire app, a massive amount of them was not being rendered in all the pages our users were supposed to be interacting with, meaning that they’d end up downloading a <em>bundle.js </em>file containing lots of unneeded fragments of code. If a patient is <em>simply</em> filling out a form to schedule a doctor’s appointment, they won’t need the huge Google Maps component to locate the clinics they went to before, which might be only required by navigating to the <strong>/previousAppointments</strong> route for example.<br>So the idea is quite simple, just don’t have the users download code until they need it.</p><p id="4fe2">Now, you might be thinking that something like this would do the trick:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="f6b4">If you’re familiar with JavaScript and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES modules</a> it wouldn’t take you so long to figure out that the above naive approach is not going to work, since by definition the modules are static, and therefore we must declare what we’re importing/exporting at compile-time, not at run time. In other words, they may only be specified at the top level of the files and not in other places such as an <em>if</em> statement.</p><p id="7003">That being said, let’s pretend for a moment that the above conditionally imported module worked. Can you think of any benefits of doing so? Certainly, instead of having to load all the application modules/components up-front, we’d be allowed to import them on demand depending on what page our visitors are at any given time, so that’d be a reasonable approach towards only downloading code the user requires.</p><p id="7676">Chances are you don’t care about IE11 anymore. But in our case, IE11 support was a must. So we concluded that if we ever find out a way to get the modules loaded conditionally, we might apply the same idea to execute legacy code <strong>only</strong> when the IE11 users landed on our web.</p><h2 id="1885">Dynamic EcmaScript modules to the rescue</h2><p id="367a">It turns out that there is a way to overcome the above-described issue: using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Dynamic_Imports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic</a> <em>import()</em> syntax. The difference with the normal import is that instead of using it as we’d normally do, we use it <strong>like </strong>a function that returns a promise — although <code>import()</code> looks like a function call, it is not actually, it’s a special syntax that just happens to use parentheses similar to <code>super()</code>.<br>Using this expression, we can load the module and return a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all of its exports. Getting back to our example, it would be something like:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="e8c8">We can even use <em>await</em> if the <em>import</em> statement were inside an <em>async</em> function:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="fcb5">One thing to be aware of, though, is that this syntax is not officially added to the EcmaScript specification yet, and at the time of this writing it’s in <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stage 4 of the process</a>. If you’re using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Create React App</a> it’s already supported by default, otherwise, you just need to install a babel plugin named <code>plugin-syntax-dynamic-import</code></p><pre><span id="2a9e">npm install — save-dev @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import</span></pre><p id="e59f">and then use it in the <code>.babelrc</code> configuration file:</p><pre><span id="9713">{ "plugins": ["@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import"] }</span></pre><p id="f653">OK so now that we all know how to import modules dynamically, you might be wondering how to use this knowledge with React, and consequently, where should we split our application at? Well, there are a couple of approaches to address this question:</p><ol><li id="d3cd">Route level splitting</li><li id="a560">Component level splitting</li></ol><h2 id="21e7">Route level splitting</h2><p id="f42a">This is the most popular way when it comes to code splitting our app. Assuming you have some experience with any kind of routing tools, this should feel pretty natural after all, isn’t it? So this is where the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>React.lazy</em></a><em> </em>function comes into play. It accepts a function which must call the dynamic import, and returns a promise which resolves to a module with a <em>default</em> export containing a React component. This means that we don’t need to render the lazily loaded component by ourselves, instead, we render what <em>React.lazy</em> returns and it’ll take care of actually rendering the component.<br>Let’s take a look at how this would look like — I’m using <a href="https://reach.tech/router/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach-router</a> instead of the typical React Router, but it shouldn’t make any difference for this example:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="d3ff">And that’s all that it takes to code split our app at the route level. In the snippet, we’re just dynamically importing the <strong><em>PreviousAppointments</em></strong> route component, but we can also use the same approach on the other two routes if we wanted to. Below is the output when we build our app — <code>yarn run build</code> or <code>npm run build</code> depending on what the package manager of your choice is.</p><pre><span id="57f0">Asset                 Size       Chunks</span><span id="7475">app.91ac87d5.js       114  KiB   0 [emitted] <br>1.19z8duj4.chunk.js   7.97 KiB   1 [emitted] <br>vendors.j8z7cn1q.js   869  KiB   2 [emitted]</span></pre><p id="37a8">You’ll get one <code>chunk</code> file per each dynamic <code>import()</code> in the app.</p><p id="5d15">What if we wanted to show some content to the users while the components are being loaded dynamically? That’s what the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>React.Suspense</em></a> component is used for. Anytime we want to import dynamic components we can wrap them all into a <code>Suspense</code> instance and pass it a <code>fallback</code> prop which is a React element that is rendered <strong>until</strong> all of its children’s components get successfully loaded. Now let’s give it a shot at Suspense by turning all of our routes into dynamic components and passing it a <code>&lt;Loading /&gt;</code> element as a fallback:</p><figure><div></div></figure><h2 id="1dee">Component level splitting</h2><p id="1003">Code splitting your application at the routes level might represent a significant improvement in terms of the size of files that webpack builds out, so you may consider it as good enough in a few cases. However, there is still a more granular way of dynamically importing code in React — at the Component level.<br>Inside a single component, you might need to render a child component based on a certain state. Assuming our <code>Map</code> component is tremendously heavy, we can get it loaded <em>if and only if</em> it’s necessary — so we’d first show a button to the users and if they want to get the Map functionality in place on the current page then they can click on it to load the component based on that action.<br>At a glance, it might sound a little bit tricky to achieve, but in practice, it’s pretty straightforward:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6d43">As you might have seen, there’s one small caveat in the above code.<br>If the module we’re dynamically importing is using ES modules (export default), it’ll have a <code>.default</code> property; this is only the case for ES modules, meaning that if the module is using commonjs (module.exports), it won’t.</p><p id="6499">Besides the dynamic <em>import()</em> proposal, another common approach to performing code splitting in client-side JavaScript is using the <code>require.ensure</code> method from webpack, but as stated in their <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs</a> the <em>import() </em>syntax should be preferred.</p><h2 id="fe43">Final thoughts</h2><p id="e534">A big gain we got in our application was the fact that we managed to optimize the bundles’ sizes since each of them ended up including only the sufficient modules/components depending on the type of users coming through the portal.</p><p id="86b4">React <code>lazy</code> and <code>Suspense</code> is definitely not a good fit if you’re using server-side rendering (SSR) in your project as this is not supported yet — I believe that might be one of the primary reasons for which those are still experimental features and are not included as part of the stable version of React. For SSR needs, React recommends a library named <a href="https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loadable Components</a>. It has a nice <a href="https://loadable-components.com/docs/server-side-rendering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide for bundle splitting with server-side rendering</a>.</p><p id="a68a">Another advantage of using code splitting was the ability to exclude administrative code for regular users to hide potentially sensitive data, which is a must while developing health care applications.</p><p id="36bc">Last but not least, be careful and use dynamic imports only when it makes sense. The static form is preferable for loading initial dependencies and can benefit more readily from static analysis tools and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tree shaking</a>.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p>Azure Bicep is an abstraction built on top of Azure ARM Templates and Azure Resource Manager that offers a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep moves away from the JSON syntax used by ARM Templates and is much easier to both read and write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Azure! This is the latest tool from Microsoft for deploying Azure resources in a DevOps process, and its even open source!</p>



<p>Let’s get started!</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Warning</strong>: Before you start using Azure Bicep, know that it is in an early Alpha state and is not supported for use in production environments just yet. Also, it doesn’t support all the functionality it eventually will. However, it does support some really great features already that makes Azure<a href="https://build5nines.com/what-is-infrastructure-as-code/"> Infrastructure as Code </a>(IaC) even easier to write and read!</p></blockquote>







<br><h2><span id="what_is_azure_bicep"></span>What is Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a new declarative Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources. The goal of this new language is to make it easier to write Infrastructure as Code (IaC) targeting Azure Resource Manager (ARM) using a syntax that’s more friendly than the JSON syntax of Azure ARM Templates.</p>



<p>Azure Bicep works as an abstraction layer built on top of ARM Templates. Anything that can be done with Azure ARM Templates can be done with Azure Bicep as it provides a “transparent abstraction” over ARM (Azure Resource Manager). With this abstraction, all the <code>types</code>, <code>apiVersions</code>, and <code>properties</code> valid within ARM Templates are also valid with Azure Bicep.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Azure Bicep is a transpiled language. This means that the Azure Bicep code converted into ARM Template code. Then, the resulting ARM Template code is used to deploy the Azure resources. This transpiling enables Azure Bicep to use it’s own syntax and compiler for authoring Azure Bicep files that compile down to Azure Resource Manager (ARM) JSON as a sort of intermediate language (IL).</p>



<p>The way that Azure Bicep is transpiled into ARM JSON is similar to how there are many different languages that can be written in, then transpiled into JavaScript that can be run within the web browser. One popular example of this type of transpiled language is TypeScript. A transpiled language offers benefits of adding an abstraction layer to make it easier and / or more feature full to write code that then gets compiled down to IL code that gets executed. This is also similar to how C# and VB.NET code compile down to MSIL in .NET code.</p>



<p>In the development world, it’s common to encounter the use of transpiled languages. It’s also common in the DevOps world where YAML and JSON are converted between one or the other. Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p>



<blockquote><p>Azure Bicep offers some similarity in how it’s transpiled into ARM JSON. This enables you to use an alternative syntax and feature set for writing declarative Infrastructure as Code than the often-cumbersome ARM JSON syntax.</p></blockquote>



<p>Azure Bicep will have limits in its ability to support features that are not natively supported by ARM Templates when deploying Azure resources. However, Azure Bicep will also be able to implement additional code reuse and other features that the Azure Bicep compiler will be able to translate into valid ARM JSON features. Through all this, Azure Bicep has a goal of offering a cleaner syntax along with better support for modularity and code re-use than is offered by ARM JSON.</p>



<h2><span id="why_use_azure_bicep"></span>Why use Azure Bicep?<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates are written in a JSON syntax that can be cumbersome to work with. Azure Bicep is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that offers a transparent abstraction over Azure Resource Manager and ARM Templates that offers support for a cleaner code syntax with better support for modularity and code re-use. Azure Bicep offers a few improvements for authoring Azure IaC over the use of ARM Template JSON.</p>



<br><h3><span id="azure_bicep_benefits"></span>Azure Bicep Benefits<span></span></h3>



<p>Here are the primary benefits of using Azure Bicep that are integrated as core goals into the Azure Bicep project and are the foundations for why Microsoft is building Azure Bicep:</p>



<ol><li>Create a better language for writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for describing, validating, and deploying Azure resources.</li><li>The Azure Bicep language is a transparent abstraction that does not require any updates or onboarding to the underlying platform in order to support a new Azure resource <code>type</code> and / or <code>apiVersion</code>.</li><li>Azure Bicep code should be easily understood and straightforward to learn for those both new and experienced with other programming languages.</li><li>Code re-use should be a primary feature allowing users freedom to modularize and re-use code without ‘copy/paste’.</li><li>Azure Bicep tooling should offer a high level of discoverability and validation. The tooling should also be developed alongside the compiler; rather than added afterwards.</li><li>Azure Bicep should enable users to have high confidence that the code is ‘syntactically valid’ before it’s deployed.</li></ol>



<p>Also, Azure Bicep is being specifically designed so that it is not a general-purpose language for meeting any need. It is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) meant for writing declarative IaC. It’s also not meant to provide a model for non-Azure related tasks.</p>



<h2><span id="install_azure_bicep"></span>Install Azure Bicep<span></span></h2>



<p>Azure Bicep is a DevOps tool built for authoring IaC used to deploy Azure resources from any environment. As a result, this means Azure Bicep supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>



<p>The primary component for Azure Bicep is the Bicep CLI. This is the required tool used for compiling Bicep code into ARM JSON; plus, it’s open source and cross-platform.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at installing Azure Bicep in different environments!</p>



<h3><span id="download_bicep_cli_binaries"></span>Download Bicep CLI Binaries<span></span></h3>



<p>When installing Azure Bicep, you will need to first download the Bicep CLI binary built for your operating system. All the binaries for the different supported operating systems can be downloaded from the official <a href="https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases page</a> of the Azure Bicep open source project.</p>



<p>You can either manually download the Bicep CLI binary and install it, or you can use the following helper script examples to install Azure Bicep more easily.</p>



<h3><span id="install_on_windows"></span>Install on Windows<span></span></h3>



<p>On Windows machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using PowerShell with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Create the install folder
$installPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.bicep"
$installDir = New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $installPath -Force
$installDir.Attributes += 'Hidden'
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-win-x64.exe", "$installPath\bicep.exe")
# Add bicep to your PATH
$currentPath = (Get-Item -path "HKCU:\Environment" ).GetValue('Path', '', 'DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames')
if (-not $currentPath.Contains("%USERPROFILE%\.bicep")) { setx PATH ($currentPath + ";%USERPROFILE%\.bicep") }
if (-not $env:path.Contains($installPath)) { $env:path += ";$installPath" }
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command.
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_macos"></span>Install on macOS<span></span></h3>



<p>On macOS machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the terminal with the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-osx-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add Gatekeeper exception (requires admin)
sudo spctl --add ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_on_linux"></span>Install on Linux<span></span></h3>



<p>On Linux machines, Azure Bicep can be installed using the following script:</p>



<pre><code># Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep
# Add bicep to your PATH (requires admin)
sudo mv ./bicep /usr/local/bin/bicep
# Verify you can now access the 'bicep' command
bicep --help
# Done!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="install_in_azure_cloud_shell"></span>Install in Azure Cloud Shell<span></span></h3>



<p>The Azure Cloud Shell runs on Ubuntu server, so to install Azure Bicep, you will need to install the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI. However, you cannot simply use the above script for installing Azure Bicep on Linux due to a limitation of the Azure Cloud Shell that prevents you from modifying the PATH.</p>



<p>Here are some steps you can follow to basically “install” Azure Bicep for use in the Azure Cloud Shell environment:</p>



<ol><li>Connect to the Azure Cloud Shell; either within the Azure Portal or at <code><a href="https://shell.azure.com/" rel="nofollow">https://shell.azure.com</a></code>.</li><li>First, you likely want to create a directory within the Azure Cloud Shell environment to save the Bicep CLI to. For example, creating a <code>~/tools</code> directory:<br><code>mkdir ~/tools</code></li><li>Next, navigate to the directory created and download the Linux binary for the Bicep CLI into the Azure Cloud Shell environment into this directory:</li></ol>



<pre><code># Navigate to "tools" directory
cd ~/tools
# Fetch the latest Bicep CLI binary
curl -Lo bicep https://github.com/Azure/bicep/releases/latest/download/bicep-linux-x64
# Mark it as executable
chmod +x ./bicep</code></pre>



<p>Using the above steps will place the Azure Bicep CLI in the location of <code>~/tools/bicep</code> within you Azure Cloud Shell environments. Once placed here, you can execute the Bicep CLI from anywhere within the Azure Cloud Shell environment by referencing it within the <code>~/tools</code> directory.</p>



<p>For example, when located within the <code>~/bicep</code> directory, you can run the following command to utilize the <code>~/tools/bicep</code> executable to build some Azure Bicep code in the <code>main.bicep</code> file:</p>



<pre><code>chris@Azure:~/bicep$ ~/tools/bicep build main.bicep</code></pre>



<p>With the Azure Bicep CLI installed into the Azure Cloud Shell environment, then you’ll be able to utilize Azure Bicep easily from anywhere without the need to install it on your local machine.</p>

If you're a candidate looking to land your dream job, you'll need to be well prepared for these cultural or behavioral interviews. </p>
<p>As a hiring manager, I've interviewed over 200 engineering candidates and a significant portion of that  has been evaluating the soft skills each candidate embodies. I've rejected extremely strong technical performers and and fought to hire some more junior candidates based on the signal I've identified from the culture interview. Because every company has their own culture, their own values, and their own questions, the culture interview can be extremely hard to prepare for. However, there's still plenty you can do to set yourself up for success instead of jumping in blind.</p>
<p>While my interviewing experience as both a hiring manager and a candidate have been primarily within engineering, I believe the tools in this kit will be mostly applicable across product, design, and other disciplines within product development organizations. </p>
<h2 id="stories-to-prepare">Stories to Prepare</h2>
<p>Why should you prepare stories instead of answers to specific questions? The simple reason is that you can't prepare and memorize an answer to every question an interviewer might ask. Often times these conversations are organic and the real signal comes from how you respond to follow-up questions. The best answers are rooted in real examples from your personal experience and by "loading" these stories into your brain ahead of time, you'll be better equipped to handle questions on the spot.</p>

<h3 id="story-1-your-career-narrative">Story #1: Your career narrative</h3>
<p>Almost everyone you talk to will give an intro of themselves and then ask you to share a brief intro as well. Depending on who you're talking to, that intro can be anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. In some cases, a hiring manager or recruiter might ask you to go deeper into your background and spend up to 30 minutes digging into your experiences.</p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ol>
<li>A narrative that connects your career together. While many careers are not linear, it can help to show that you were deliberate about the jobs you took and what you wanted to learn at each one. You may find that as you look back on your career, there's a story you can weave together that ties together where you started, where you're at now, and the trajectory you're on. A story that shows strong growth, surmounting challenges, and a high forward trajectory can help get companies excited about you. Finish your story such that the company you're talking to easily makes sense as the next step on your career journey.<ul>
<li>A weak narrative merely lists what's on your resume, e.g., "in 2013 I joined X and did these projects, in 2014 I joined Y and did these projects, and recently I've done Z and B. I want to join this company because it's doing really well."</li>
<li>A stronger narrative gives context on your decisions and motivations, e.g., "In college, I was excited about electronics and human-computer interfaces, so I looked for companies that specialized in consumer hardware. X company was one of the companies that stood out, and when I joined I got to work on the interface for Product P. This taught me [so and so] but after 2 years there, I really wanted to get better at [this other thing], so I reached out to Company Y. From there, I grew into [some role], helped the company do [these things], and now I'm [doing something impressive]. Going forward, I'm looking for an opportunity where I can put my front end architecture skills to good use while learning how to build complex systems at scale. I admire [company name] for being able to build high quality user interfaces while being super fast and reliable. I think this might be a great fit for my expertise and give me opportunities to grow my backend skills."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What specific things you're looking for in your next role. These should apply to more than one company to show that you're not just pandering to the company, but try to be opinionated at the same time.<ul>
<li>A weak answer is too vague, uncertain, or demonstrates that you haven't put much thought to it.<ul>
<li>e.g., "I'm looking for a place where I can advance my career." or "I wanted to get into AI and Machine Learning because it's a really hot industry right now."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A stronger answer shows that you've clearly thought about what you want, have had enough experience to know what you don't want, and implicitly show why the company you're talking to is a good fit.<ul>
<li>e.g., "Over my career, I've found that it's really important for me to have a strong sense of ownership over my work. I enjoy taking an ambiguous customer problem, breaking it down with a PM or designer, and then being able to see the whole project through from start to finish. I like to solve problems and not just execute on tasks, even if that means working through some dealing with a lot of uncertainty at times and wearing many hats."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-the-interviewer-is-looking-for">What the interviewer is looking for</h4>
<ul>
<li>For quick intros, interviewers are generally not evaluating your storytelling ability. Instead, they want to know why you might be a good fit for the role and what your motivations are.</li>
<li>For hiring managers and recruiters, your career narrative can be a useful lens to interpret the interview feedback and make a decision on whether or not to move forward.<ul>
<li>For example, if your background is primarily backend engineering and the interviews demonstrate weakness in UI implementation, then your narrative can help interviewers focus more on your strengths over your weaker areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you under-represent yourself at this stage, you may miss an opportunity to move forward in the interview process or get an offer.<ul>
<li>On the flip side, you should avoid changing your narrative too much simply to suit the role or company you're talking to. It's often better to be rejected for a role that really doesn't fit you than to get a role doing something that doesn't actually align with what you want.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questions-that-interviewers-may-ask">Questions that interviewers may ask</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
<li>What are you looking for in your next role?</li>
<li>Why are you interested in [company]?</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599088479939/uCQDKllBU.png"></p>
<h3 id="story-2-two-impressive-projects">Story #2: Two Impressive Projects</h3>
<p>You should be prepared to talk in depth about at least two meaningful projects you've worked on where you played a significant role. Why two? If you use the same example for every question, the interviewer may think you're lacking experience or have a weak track record. Having at least two substantial projects in your pocket will help you balance breadth and depth to respond to a variety of questions.</p>
<p>Keep your initial explanation short (between 3-5 minutes) and offer to go deeper afterwards. This will help keep the conversation focused and avoid wasting time on unimportant details.</p>
<p>A good format to use whenever you're giving an example of something that happened is to use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm">SBI framework</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vawizard.org/wiz-pdf/STAR_Method_Interviews.pdf">STAR framework</a>. For these examples I'll use the SBI model. </p>
<h4 id="what-to-prepare">What to prepare</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation</strong>: Share context on the project before jumping into what you did.<ul>

<ul>
<li>Does the work align with the level and scope of the role?<ul>
<li>Are they applying for a role that's realistic with what they've done historically?</li>
<li>What kind of domain expertise do they have?</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Can the candidate clearly articulate the benefit and impact of their work?<ul>
<li>It's surprising how often some people don't know or think about the result of their work beyond completing the tasks that were assigned to them. Strong candidates think about the entire workflow, from idea conception to evaluating success.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do they have a growth mindset?<ul>
<li>Are they able to reflect on both the successes and misses of that project?</li>
<li>Do they take credit for all the things that went well and blame others for all the things that didn't go well? (This would be a red flag.)</li>

<h3 id="story-3-resolving-a-conflict">Story #3: Resolving a conflict</h3>
<p>Delivering successful projects often require working with a lot of stakeholders and collaborators. Demonstrate that you can work well with others, share critical feedback, and resolve situations on your own.</p>
<p>I've been surprised at how often candidates talk about a situation where they ultimately failed to resolve a conflict. It can be hard to think of a good example on the spot, so definitely prepare this ahead of time and consider what you want the interviewer to take away.</p>

<p>In this blog post we will take a look inside the Wyze Outdoor Base Station and see whats going on. Many people were very excited to hop on board the Wyze train when they announced the outdoor camera – however it has mostly been met with bad reviews and buggy, half baked features. </p>

<p>Lets get this thing out of the plastic case to take a closer look, carefully removing the RF1.13 IPX connectors for the antenna signal wire.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-1024x483.jpg" alt="" width="1068" height="503" srcset="https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-1024x483.jpg 1024w, https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-300x141.jpg 300w, https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-768x362.jpg 768w, https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-1536x724.jpg 1536w, https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-2048x965.jpg 2048w, https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-1200x566.jpg 1200w, https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside2-1980x933.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px"><figcaption>The guts</figcaption></figure>



<p>We can see that the board is labeled 9531_HL_CORE_AM7</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="403" height="318" src="https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside1-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside1-2.jpg 403w, https://illumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/WyzeOutdoorBasestationInside1-2-300x237.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"><figcaption>The SoC is a Qualcom QCA9531-BL3A</figcaption></figure>



<p>Qualcomm marketing says:</p>



<blockquote><p>The QCA9531 is a highly integrated and feature-rich IEEE 802.11n 2×2 2.4 GHz System-on-a-Chip (SoC) for advanced WLAN platforms.</p><cite><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/qca9531">https://www.qualcomm.com/products/qca9531</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>The Specifications sheet on Qualcomms website is very light on details, but this looks like a common SoC for low end networking and cheapo wireless routers. </p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Specifications:</strong></p><p><strong>CPU Clock Speed:&nbsp;</strong>Up to 650 MHz</p><p><strong>Wi-Fi Standards:&nbsp;</strong>802.11a/b/g,&nbsp;802.11n</p><p><strong>Peak Speed:&nbsp;</strong>300 Mbps</p><p><strong>Channel Utilization:&nbsp;</strong>20/40 MHz</p><p><strong>MIMO Configuration:&nbsp;</strong>2×2 (2-stream)</p><p><strong>Ethernet Standards:&nbsp;</strong>IEEE 802.3</p><p><strong>Ethernet Network:&nbsp;</strong>10/100</p><p><strong>Supported Ports:&nbsp;</strong>5 ports</p><p><strong>USB Version:&nbsp;</strong>USB 2.0</p><p><strong>Memory speed:&nbsp;</strong>300MHz,&nbsp;200MHz</p><p><strong>Memory Type:&nbsp;</strong>DDR1,&nbsp;DDR2</p><p><strong>Supported Interfaces:&nbsp;</strong>JTAG,&nbsp;SPI,&nbsp;UART,&nbsp;USB 2.0,&nbsp;PCIe 1.1</p><p><strong>General Purpose I/Os:&nbsp;</strong>17x</p><p><strong>Package Type:&nbsp;</strong>DRQFN</p><p><strong>Package Size:&nbsp;</strong>12 x 12 mm</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems like this might be a board built by Nova Electronics that Wyze is putting into a nice package. Looks Familiar right?</p>



<p>The 3 pins on the right side of the board look like they could be SPI – so we tried to solder some pins on and get a terminal open</p>



<p>I guessed the TX / RX pins, and the ground was labeled nicely on the board. For Reference: </p>



<ul><li>Ground to GND (Duh!)</li><li>TX is L1</li><li>RX is L2</li></ul>

<p>I connected with a cheapo CP2102 USB to UART adapter, set the baud rate to 115200 and was off to the races… kinda</p>

<p>Well this is interesting, this little guy is running OpenWRT.  I guessed all of the normal user / password combos I could think of and didn’t get anywhere – If anyone has any ideas on how to get into this shoot me a message / comment!</p>



<p>Lets watch it boot up and see if there is anything interesting going on here: </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Rust is increasingly used as a programming language for smart contracts.
Whereas the first generation blockchains used specialized VMs,
newer blockchains are running general purpose VMs,
especially <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>.
And of course,
Rust is a modern language that runs just about everywhere,
and is especially good at targetting WASM.
Somewhat serendipitously,
this has made Rust one of the best candidate languages for writing
smart contracts on the new generation of blockchains.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been learning more about the smart contract programming landscape,
and this post is about my first dive into smart contract programming in
Rust on the <a href="https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore">NEAR</a> platform.</p>

<p>NEAR is a sharded, proof-of-stake blockchain that runs WASM.
It not only supports smart contracts written in Rust
(in addition to <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a>),
but is also itself written in Rust.
While one the most prominent Rust blockchain projects,
it is perhaps not yet widely known in the broader blockchain development community.</p>

<p>Based on my experiences here though,
I’m quite enthusiastic about the NEAR developer experience,
and I intend to spend more time hacking on NEAR.</p>

<p>These are my first impressions of NEAR,
as someone with moderate knowledge of blockchains,
but limited previous blockchain programing experience.
I have previously written similarly about my first experiences
with other blockchains: <a href="https://talk.nervos.org/t/experience-report-first-time-building-and-running-ckb/4518/">Nervos</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Aimeedeer/bigannouncement/blob/master/doc/hacklog.md">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-at-the-start-of-the-docs">Starting at the start of the docs</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.near.org/">NEAR documentation</a> seems refreshingly thorough,
if a bit confusing to navigate.
There are different docs to follow depending on your role in the network,
whether a validator,
smart contract programmer,
etc.
and I find myself jumping between multiple sections,
without quite understanding how the docs are organized overall,
perhaps because there isn’t a single table of contents that covers the entire site.</p>

<p>Anyway, after browsing the docs to get a general idea of their organization,
I go back to the front page and I click “Basics”.
This seems to be leading me down the path of being a smart contract developer,
not running my own local node,
not building NEAR itself.</p>

<p>For sake of understanding,
I generally want to build the entire stack I’m working on,
but for now I’m going to follow the docs exactly and see where that gets me,
and not build NEAR on my own.</p>

<h2 id="account-creation">Account creation</h2>

<p>Setting up an account is done through a web interface at:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://wallet.testnet.near.org/">https://wallet.testnet.near.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I create a testnet account,
<code>floopy.testnet</code>,
and a recovery phrase.</p>

<p>The NEAR explorer page for my account is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet">https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/floopy.testnet</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead of a hash for an ID,
as in most blockchains,
you get an actual string name.
And the system can optionally do account recovery over email or phone.
While this is convenient, it seems suspiciously centralized for a public blockchain,
and I wonder if it is possible to create accounts without any central authority.
I imagine it is, and this website is mostly a convenience, but don’t know yet.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Following <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/development/near-cli">the docs</a>, I install <code>near-cli</code>, a Node app.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ npm install -g near-cli

<p>Semes to work fine.</p>

<p>From previous doc reading I know that running a full node typically involves running <a href="https://github.com/near/nearup">nearup</a>.
It appears though that I don’t need that now,
so probably for the purposes of developing on near,
<code>near-cli</code> will just talk to existing public nodes.</p>

<p>At this point I seem to hit the end of the “basics” documentation flow,
without really accomplishing anything,
but I remember <a href="https://docs.near.org/docs/quick-start/new-to-near#how-do-i-get-started">from the beginning of these docs</a> that “choose a starter project”
is step 2.</p>

<p>I back up and choose the <a href="https://examples.near.org/rust-status-message"><code>rust-status-message</code></a> starter project.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-contract">Running a contract</h2>

<p>The examples say to install <code>near-shell</code>,
but that project has been renamed to <code>near-cli</code>.
I see that there are already PRs submitted to fix this,
but they are about a month old.
There are a number of relatively old PRs in NEAR repos that haven’t been reviewed.</p>

<p>I clone the example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/near-examples/rust-status-message
$ cd rust-status-message
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And build per the instructions:</p>



<p>This is an npm build that wraps a cargo build.
I’m curious if there’s any JavaScript involved,
but I suspect they are just using npm as the primary interface
for the sake of familiarity and for consistency with
the build process for AssemblyScript smart contracts.</p>

<p>Looking at <code>package.json</code> it’s true that npm isn’t doing much here,
but it <em>is</em> adding a post-build step that cargo is incapable of:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>  </span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"build"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"postbuild"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is an error in the build:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>error[E0463]: can't find crate for `core`
  |
  = note: the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target may not be installed

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.
error: could not compile `byte-tools`.
warning: build failed, waiting for other jobs to finish...
error: build failed

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an easy error to understand to somebody familiar with embedded Rust development,
but probably not to other newbies.
The toolchain just doesn’t have the <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> target installed.
I don’t know if I missed the documentation that explained this,
but the user experience here could be better.</p>

<p>I add the wasm target:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
info: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
info: installing component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that the build works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ npm run build

&gt; rust-status-message-builder@1.0.0 build /home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message
&gt; cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

   Compiling near-sdk v0.11.0
   Compiling status-message v0.1.0 (/home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 3.99s

&gt; rust-status-message-builder@1.0.0 postbuild /home/ubuntu/near/rust-status-message
&gt; cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/status_message.wasm ./res/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I try to deploy to the testnet using a temporary developer account:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com
We would like to collect data on near-cli usage to improve developer experience. We will never send private information. We only collect which commands are run via an anonymous identifier. Would you like to opt in (y/n)?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>NEAR wants me to opt in to telemetry.
I’m sympathetic,
but since this command presumably will have access to private keys,
I’m not confident that the developers have been suitably careful
about avoiding collection of private data.
For now I say “n”, until I can review that code.</p>

<p>The command continues:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ near dev-deploy --wasmFile res/status_message.wasm --helperUrl https://near-contract-helper.onrender.com
We would like to collect data on near-cli usage to improve developer experience. We will never send private information. We only collect which commands are run via an anonymous identifier. Would you like to opt in (y/n)? n

<p><code>near dev-deploy</code> has apparently created a script <code>neardev/dev-account.env</code>

I call it with <code>source neardev/dev-account.env</code>.</p>

<p>I call <code>near call</code> to set the status message in the contract:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>URL query parameters and how laxness creates de facto requirements on the web</h2>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

<![CDATA[How to negotiate a higher salary and why you should]]>

<br/>
September 7, 2020 | https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dollartrak.com/negotiate-salary-to-achieve-your-financial-goals/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>Many people concentrate on saving and investing as a way to achieve their financial goals.  Both of these are easier to grow with a higher income.  No matter what your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a> are, negotiating a higher salary will make them easier to achieve.</p>



<p>The time you spend researching your fair market value, preparing requests for raises, and making requests for adjustments might very well be the most valuable use of your time.</p>



<p>Considering the importance of salary you would think that people would constantly be on top of their market value ensuring they are compensated fairly.  In my experience this is often not the case.</p>



<h2>Many People are Underpaid and Don’t Even Know it</h2>



<p>Like most people I knew, I never talked about my salary with my friends or co-workers.  It’s taboo for many Americans.  This lack of transparency makes it easy to be underpaid while being unaware of it.  This benefits your employer, but not you!</p>



<p>Once I took on a senior leadership position I begun to understand the severity of differences in how people are compensated for similar positions.  In some cases employees with the same job title were compensated double what others were.</p>



<p>I am sure that most people are aware these inequities exist and might blame them on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-salary-history-bans-boost-pay-for-african-americans-women-11592472602?mod=e2fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discrimination</a>, differences in quality of work, education or level of education.  In my experience a lack of salary negotiation and keeping their salary up to date is the main driver. </p>



<p>Negotiating your salary can be uncomfortable, and asking for raises can be even more so.  This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it though!  Many will shy away from it and those that do not will end up making much more money over time to do the same job.</p>



<h2>Increases in Salary Compound Over Your Career</h2>



<p>As people get further along in their careers these differences can grow to nearly overwhelming numbers.  Employees can literally make over double what others make for the same job.  This is because of the compounding nature of raises on your salary over the course of your career.</p>



<p>Raises are generally given on a percentage basis of your current salary.  What this means is every single time you get a raise you are also getting a raise on all of your previous raises.  This adds up the same way compound interest adds up.  Over time the numbers can get large and with a 40 year long career for many there can be a lot of time for this to happen.</p>



<h2>Examples of Compounding Salary</h2>



<p>Lets look at a few simple scenarios over a 20 year job with a company.  The first scenario shows the affect of negotiating a higher starting salary and the second one shows the affect of negotiating occasional large raises.</p>



<h3>Affect of Negotiating a Higher Starting Salary</h3>



<p>Jack and Jill both were offered the same job, but Jill negotiated a very modest 10% higher salary than Jack.  They both did well and received 3% raises over the course of 20 years working for the company.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$57,963</td><td>$67,195</td><td>$77,898</td><td>$90,305</td><td>$1.43M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>The $5,000 starting difference turns into a little over $9,000 a year difference over 20 years.  This resulted in Jill making an extra $140,000 over the course of her job with this company.</p>



<h3>Affects of Negotiating Larger Raises</h3>



<p>Here we will modify the above table to show Jill negotiating a 10% raise for herself every 5 years while Jack happily accepts the standard 3%.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>Base</td><td>Year 5</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Year 15</td><td>Year 20</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Jack</td><td>$45000</td><td>$52,167</td><td>$60,476</td><td>$70,108</td><td>$81,275</td><td>$1.29M</td></tr><tr><td>Jill</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$61,903</td><td>$76,640</td><td>$94,884</td><td>$117,473</td><td>$1.63M</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>3% annual raises over 20 years, Jill get’s 10% every 5 years</figcaption></figure>



<p>After 20 years with a salary of $81,275 jack would need a whopping 45% raise just to catch up to Jill and still would be behind by $340,000 in lifetime earnings!</p>



<h2>How do I Keep My Salary Up to Date</h2>



<h3>Know Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>This always starts with knowing what your fair market value is.  There are several websites that can help here.  I like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.glassdoor.com/" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.salary.com/" target="_blank">Salary.com</a>.  Do a little research and come up with a range that you feel is reasonable.  </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="548" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=640%2C548&amp;ssl=1" alt="salary chart" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?w=731&amp;ssl=1 731w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image.png?resize=300%2C257&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Taken from salary.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>You should be honest with yourself about your skills and experience, but I recommend starting at the high end of the range and working down from there.  If someone else can make $100,000 a year doing your job, why not you?</p>



<h3>Getting Your Salary Right to Start</h3>



<p>In my experience the majority of people will accept the first salary offer given.  This is generally a mistake.  Why would a hiring manager make you his absolute top dollar offer to start?  He is generally wise to leave a little room for negotiation for the candidates that do counteroffer.  Some candidates will want to counteroffer no matter what you offer them first!</p>



<p>Once you accept a lower salary it is VERY difficult to get it corrected.  You may have some success here at smaller companies but with larger companies and their bureaucracy don’t get your hopes up.  In my experience the best way to fix this is to find a new job.  You can avoid it by knowing your market value and negotiating a proper base to start.</p>



<h3>Constantly Update Skills</h3>



<p>The job market is always changing.  You need to keep up with it and try to stay out in front of it to maximize your earning potential.  Whatever field you are in set annual goals to achieve certifications, complete continuing education, learn a new tool or attend a conference.  </p>



<p>While one of these things by itself may not change your career, the culmination of annual self improvement over 5 to 10 years can make a massive difference in your marketability.  Senior level employees with relevant certifications and experience can be worth many times what an entry level employee is.</p>



<h3>Take Advantage of Your Time at Work</h3>



<p>You are going to be there for 8 hours a day so you might as well make the most of it.  Always seek out new projects that allow you to learn and develop your skills.  Ask about company paid training, certification or tuition.  Look for ways to add value above and beyond normal for your task.</p>



<p>Most employers will provide you with the tools, money or time to improve your skills because it directly benefits them.  If they won’t help you out here, you may want to re-consider if working there is good for your long term success.</p>



<h3>Write Down Accomplishments as They Happen</h3>



<p>Many companies do a once per year salary adjustment.  Isn’t it basically impossible to remember what all you did when walking into this conversation?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="426" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist.jpg?resize=640%2C426&amp;ssl=1" alt="checklist" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1022&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1363&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/checklist-scaled.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Keep a running list of your accomplishments</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best way to remember it all is to write it down as it happens.  Keep a running log of your accomplishments. Write them all down and come into the annual review process armed with the information you need.</p>



<h3>Frequently Update Your Fair Market Value</h3>



<p>Your fair market value is likely always changing.  Make sure to check the websites and understand if you are compensated fairly on a regular basis.  Always do this before an annual review.  </p>



<p>If the market has shifted for your skill set, or a new skill you learned is valuable, make sure your employer knows!  This is the time to ask for a larger than standard raise.  That new certification you acquired could be a great reason to go after a 5 or 10% raise this year.</p>



<h2>Asking for an Adjustment When You are Underpaid</h2>



<p>If you want to stick it out with your company, but found that you were underpaid you will need to ask for an adjustment to market value.  I find that the request should have the following basic supporting documentation:</p>



<ol><li>Report’s on salary range for your job from multiple sources.  If you are underpaid, show them multiple sources that validate this.  The more you can find the better.</li><li>Detail any recent skills you have developed or certifications that you have obtained. </li><li>List of recent accomplishments at work that show you have gone above and beyond.  You have been keeping the list like I recommend above right?</li></ol>



<p>I have asked for larger raises(&gt;10%) multiple times in my career and always gotten what I wanted by using the above method.  I have also been asked for raises by quite a few employees over the years.  Those with accompanying documentation like above were taken much more seriously.</p>



<h2>Leave If Your Employer Doesn’t Value You Correctly</h2>



<p>Some employers will never pay you fair market value.  This could be because they don’t value you fairly or because they don’t need the skills you have.  They may also just not have the money in the budget for someone of your skill level.  </p>



<p>Don’t let their decisions hold you back.  If they won’t pay you fairly then be prepared to get up and leave.  If you have been updating your skills regularly as I mentioned above you may find that moving to a better position is surprisingly easy.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this has shed a little light onto the importance of salary negotiations when being hired and frequently during the course of your career.  If you ignore these conversations because they can be uncomfortable you will pay dearly for it over the long term.  </p>



<p>Ultimately, your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/06/09/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> can be dramatically reduced and result in you having to work for many extra years in order to meet your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/set-and-achieve-financial-goals/">financial goals</a>.  You should take charge of this part of your career before you look back and wish you had.</p>

<![CDATA[Git/serve: A Git server for Plan 9]]>

<br/>
September 7, 2020 | https://orib.dev/gitserve.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://orib.dev/gitserve.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<p>A while ago, I released <a href="https://orib.dev/git9.html">git9</a>, a git client for
Plan 9. However, it always felt like it was missing something: A git server.
over a few weekends of work, I sat down and put one together. This Labor
Day weekend, I took the opportunity to labor on it, and got something working.</p>

<h3>usage</h3>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> is a git server designed to fit into the Plan
9 ecosystem, allowing hosting of, and interacting with, code on a Plan 9
server, while still allowing legacy clients running on Unix to get a copy
of the code.</p>

<p><code>Git/serve</code> only speaks the <code>git://</code> protocol.
But because it runs behind
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/listen">aux/listen</a>
and 
<a href="http://man.9front.org/8/tlssrv"><code>tlssrv</code></a>, we
effectively get two additional protocols for free: <code>gits://</code>, or
TLS-encrypted <code>git://</code>, and <code>hjgit://</code>, which is
<code>git://</code> but with Plan 9 authentication to support user login
over TLS. Unfortunately, only the unencrypted <code>git://</code> protocol
is supported out of the box by upstream git. There may be ways to solve
this, using <a href="https://rovaughn.github.io/2015-2-9.html">custom
transports</a>, and a unix port of tlsclient</p>

<p>To start a <code>git://</code> server, just run it under aux/listen1.
To enable encryption and user authentication, run it under
<code>tlssrv -a</code>. This doesn't need a certificate, because
the Plan 9 authentication generates the secret used for TLS. And,
finally, if you just want encryption, you can use <code>tlsclient</code>
with a certificate.</p>

<pre># git:// server, serving every repository under the current directory
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' git/serve -r `{pwd}

# gits:// server, doing the same: But with encryption.
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -c /path/to/cert.pem git/serve -r `{pwd}

# hjgit:// server doing the same: Requires account on server to connect
% aux/listen1 'tcp!*!9418' tlsclient -a git/serve -r `{pwd}
</pre>

<p>If you want to allow people to write, you can just add the
<code>-w</code> flag to git/serve. While you can do this on
any of the protocols, keep in mind that only <code>hjgit://</code>
authenticates the users. Push to the world, but don't let the
world push to you!</p>



<p>All the protocols git uses are closely related. The <code>ssh://</code>
protocol is just the <code>git://</code> protocol, with the command selected
sightly differently. The smart <code>http://</code> protocols are the same
as the <code>git://</code> protocol, with a different handshake, and split
over multiple post requests.</p>

<p>Git9 implements the git protocol in under 500 lines of C. The
full code is available on github, in
<a href="https://github.com/oridb/git9/blob/24abe6c00b6f65e7241763399fc72c043b7d9bbf/serve.c">serve.c</a>.
</p>

<p>The protocol look something like this for pushing:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 0086:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 009d:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 refs/heads/master\n"
&lt;=w= 0076:	"747e9e80f710c0b8bbd928080745915ad2493322 dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\0report-status\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= <pack-data>
=r=&gt; 000e:	unpack ok
=r=&gt; 0019:	ok refs/heads/master
</pack-data></pre>

<p>And this for pulling:</p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-upload-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
<pack-data>
</pack-data></pre>

<p>The git protocol consists of pkt-lines, which are strings with a
hex-formatted length prefix.  The length prefix includes itself.  So,
the string <code>"hi"</code> would be formatted as
<code>0006hi</code>. A zero lenth packet where the length prefix
is not included is special. This is called a 'flush packet', and
is used to terminate a phase of negotiation.</p>

<p> All negotiation is with these packet lines, at
which git flips over to pure binary mode to transfer a pack file
over.</p>

<p>In the <code>git://</code> protocol, the client always starts off
by saying which action it wants to do: Either it wants the server to
fetch a pack from the client, or it wants the server to upload a pack
to the client.  That's this line:</p><pre>&lt;=w= 0030:	"git-fetch-pack /oridb/git9\0host=github.com\n"
</pre>

<p>The upload side of this protocol is simpler on the server side so
we'll go through it first.</p>

<h3>pushing</h3>

<p>In the upload protocol, the server begins by sending a list of
references that the client may update. In <code>git/serve</code>
we grab all the refs in the repository, and filter down to just
the ones beginning with <code>heads/</code>.</p>

<pre>	if((nrefs = listrefs(&amp;refs, &amp;names)) == -1)
		sysfatal("listrefs: %r");
	for(i = 0; i &lt; nrefs; i++){
		if(strncmp(names[i], "heads/", strlen("heads/")) != 0)
			continue;
		if(fmtpkt(c, "%H refs/%s\n", refs[i], names[i]) == -1)
			goto error;
	}
	if(flushpkt(c) == -1)
		goto error;
</pre>

<p>With the first phase of the protocol, the client then
sends the list of references it wants to update. This
takes the form of:</p>

<pre>	OLDHASH NEWHASH heads/refs/updateme\n"
</pre>

<p>Because the client knows what the reference versions are on
the server, it can compute what commits are between the version
on the server and the version that it has. If the new hash
is the zero hash, this signals to the server that the reference
should be deleted. This list of updates is terminated with a
flush packet. The code in git9 that handles this is below:

</p><pre>	while(1){
		/* Did we get a packet? */
		if((n = readpkt(c, pkt, sizeof(pkt))) == -1)
			goto error;
		/* Was it a flush packet? */
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		/* Split it up into the 3 parts: old, new, reference */
		if(getfields(pkt, sp, nelem(sp), 1, " \t\n\r") != 3){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR  protocol garble %s\n", pkt);
			goto error;
		}
		/* verify that these are valid hashes */
		if(hparse(&amp;old, sp[0]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad old hash %s\n", sp[0]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(hparse(&amp;new, sp[1]) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR bad new hash %s\n", sp[1]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and valid refs */
		if(!validref(sp[2])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR invalid ref %s\n", sp[2]);
			goto error;
		}
		/* and then remember them for when we do the update */
		*cur = erealloc(*cur, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*upd = erealloc(*upd, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		*ref = erealloc(*ref, (*nupd + 1)*sizeof(Hash));
		(*cur)[*nupd] = old;
		(*upd)[*nupd] = new;
		(*ref)[*nupd] = estrdup(sp[2]);
		*nupd += 1;
	}
</pre>

<p>Next, the client uploads the pack. This is a blob containing
the commit data. It goes into <code>.git/objects/packs/recv-$pid.pack</code>,
at least until we can index it and rename it.</p>

<pre>	while(1){
		n = read(c-&gt;rfd, buf, sizeof(buf));
		if(n == 0)
			break;
		if(n == -1 || write(pfd, buf, n) != n)
			return -1;
		packsz += n;
	}
	if(checkhash(pfd, packsz, &amp;h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "hash mismatch\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(indexpack(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "indexing failed\n");
		goto error1;
	}
	if(rename(packtmp, idxtmp, h) == -1){
		dprint(1, "rename failed: %r\n");
		goto error2;
	}
</pre>

<p>Finally, we update the references. Note that we haven't
locked the repository yet. This is because none of the data
we have here can conflict: All objects are addressed by hash,
so a race would simply leave us with a duplicate hash in the
packfile. Eventually, a <code>git/repack</code> will clean
that up.</p>

<p>However, updating the references can conflict. So,
for updating the references, we acquire a lock file.
We then read all the references, make sure that they
match the old reference, and then write in the new
reference.</p>

<pre>	for(i = 0; i &lt; nupd; i++){
		if(resolveref(&amp;h, ref[i]) == 0 &amp;&amp; !hasheq(&amp;h, &amp;cur[i])){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR old ref changed: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((o = readobject(upd[i])) == nil){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR update to nonexistent hash %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if(o-&gt;type != GCommit){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR not commit: %H", upd[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		unref(o);
		if(snprint(refpath, sizeof(refpath), ".git/%s", ref[i]) == sizeof(refpath)){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR ref path too long: %s", ref[i]);
			goto error;
		}
		if((fd = create(refpath, OWRITE, 0644)) == -1){
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR open ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		if(fprint(fd, "%H", upd[i]) == -1){
			close(fd);
			fmtpkt(c, "ERR upate ref: %r");
			goto error;
		}
		close(fd);
	}
</pre>

<p>And that's pushing.

</p><h3>pulling</h3>

<p>Pulling takes more work on the server side, because the
server needs to compute a reasonable packfile to send to
the client. The protocol itself is still fairly simple.</p>

<p>It begins the same way as pushing, by sending all the
branches that a client may want to obtain from the git
repository.</p>

<pre>=r=&gt; 013b:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 HEAD\n"
=r=&gt; 003f:	"dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1 refs/heads/master\n"
=r=&gt; 0000
</pre>

<p>The client then starts telling us what commits they want,
and what commits they have. This lets us find a graph difference
between the server and client graph, and generate a pack file
that contains few, if any, extraneous commits. </p>

<pre>&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 5d761590cfdce23e4b17e94050b0776c8804d4a1\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want 8f0eb1386a2c748cb7bf26917684479ff8c6d5b5\n"
&lt;=w= 0032:	"want dc4a9d467c6a28dab3927c8611a1bfbc571f1568\n"
&lt;=w= 0000
&lt;=w= 0033:	"have dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
&lt;=w= 0009:	"done\n"
=r=&gt; 0031:	"ACK dc802c499dc7164aa208b919a07c5bd18701b0e1\n"
</pre>

<p>Computing the commits that go into a pack is not always trivial.
The comits that the client may be on may have "bubbles" in the graph,
so simply walking back from the start of the graph to the commits
that the client has may end up walking around the commit, leading
to nearly the whole history of the repository being sent, instead
of just one or two commits.</p>

<p>Consider a repo where the server is ahead of the client, and
now the client is trying to pull the changes. The client has commits
<code>c</code>, and we're trying to compute a pack with only the
commits <code>o</code>.</p>


<pre>                o---o
               /     \
    --c---c---c---c---o---o &lt;-- server
                  ^
                client
</pre>

<p>The client does a git/pull, and sends that it has the
commit marked <code>[c]</code>. Since the server has
every commit the client does, and more, it can look at
all ancestors of the client commit. If we're smart, we
would, but a naive …</p></div>

              <article>
                  

<p>Each year, I try to set a few personal goals that stretch me in some way.</p>

<p>In 2017, for example, I <a href="https://forrestbrazeal.com/2017/12/03/how-to-read-100-books-in-a-year-and-still-have-a-life/">read one hundred books</a>, which turned out to be more a test of endurance than skill.</p>

<p>This year, I decided to see if I could write a fictional short story and get it published somewhere. Though I do a fair amount of technical writing in the course of my work, I’d never seriously attempted to write and sell a short story before, or even taken a creative writing class.</p>

<p>This meant I had no knowledge of the market, no connections, and generally no idea what I was doing.</p>

<p>So, a challenge!</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>I decided to focus on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_fiction">speculative fiction genre</a>, partly because it seemed more accessible and mostly because unlike literary journals, the best speculative fiction magazines still pay their authors.</p>

<p>My goals, in descending order of likelihood, were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get something published somewhere, even if unpaid</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published and get paid something for it, even a token amount</p></li>

<li><p>Get something published at <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#short">Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) professional rates</a> (currently 6 cents a word)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least 1000 words published at SFWA-qualifying markets (the standard for <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#associate">SFWA associate member status</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Get at least three stories published, totaling more than 10,000 words, at SFWA-qualifying professional markets (<a href="https://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/#active">SFWA Active Member status</a>, my self-imposed standard for a legit “professional” science fiction writer)</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="results-through-nov-8">Results (through Nov. 8)</h2>

<p>After many form rejections on several terrible stories, I sold my <a href="https://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/biotech/forrest-brazeal/memory-foam">first story</a> on March 23rd, 2018, to Daily Science Fiction (an SWFA pro market). At 1010 words, this sale actually crossed the first four goals off my list at once.</p>

<p>However, I continued to write and improve over the spring and summer of 2018, selling several more stories along the way, eventually totaling more than 16,000 words of fiction. Some publications have long wait times, but by the time “Empathy Bee” <a href="http://www.diabolicalplots.com/the-diabolical-plots-year-five-fiction-lineup/">is published</a> in March 2019, I should have the wordcount needed for active SFWA membership status, my most insane stretch goal.</p>

<h3 id="by-the-numbers">By the numbers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Stories Written: 22</p></li>

<li><p>Total Wordcount: ~60,000, the length of a medium-sized novel</p></li>

<li><p>Total Submissions: 70</p></li>

<li><p>Stories Sold: 8</p></li>

<li><p>SFWA-qualifying professional sales: 6</p></li>

<li><p>Rejections: 50 (15 personal)</p></li>

<li><p>Withdrawals: 2</p></li>

<li><p>Still Pending: 10</p></li>

<li><p>Other Results: <a href="https://www.writersofthefuture.com/writers-of-the-future-3rd-quarter-standings-for-year-35/">Honorable Mention, Writers of the Future</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<h3 id="have-no-ego">Have no ego</h3>

<p>It turns out writing short stories that sell is really, really hard. It’s hard to think of good ideas, it’s hard to write them down in a form that anyone would want to read, and it’s even harder when those readers are magazine editors who get literally hundreds of unsolicited submissions every month. Don’t attempt it if you have an easily bruised sense of self-worth, or you will be depressed a lot.</p>

<p>I’m grateful to have sold some stories this year, but my identity is not tied up in “being a writer”. It can’t be, because I have to…</p>

<h3 id="embrace-failure">Embrace failure</h3>

<p>I learned to view rejections as a badge of honor, which is a helpful mental trick to keep from going insane after a few dozen forms. As I told Jason Bougger in an <a href="http://www.themeofabsence.com/2018/11/author-interview-forrest-brazeal/">author interview</a> over at Theme of Absence, rejections are like the good soreness you feel after working out – it means you’re growing.</p>

<h3 id="keep-your-feedback-loop-short">Keep your feedback loop short</h3>

<p>Early on, when I was getting form rejections from big magazines with no accompanying feedback, I got really frustrated because I knew my work was obviously not up to par – I just didn’t know why. A submission to a smaller publication, Abyss and Apex (who I later ended up selling a different story to!) brought back a personalized rejection with a helpful piece of advice: try signing up for the <a href="https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com/">Online Writing Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>At the time I had never heard of writers’ workshops and didn’t really understand why they would be helpful. But I paid a few dollars and signed up. The other writers there provided generous feedback on how to improve my work, and I learned just as much from critiquing their pieces. The OWW membership more than paid for itself when several readers pointed out an obvious plot hole in my story “Empathy Bee”, which subsequently sold in revised form to Diabolical Plots.</p>

<p>Later, once I had professional credits, I was able to join the wonderful <a href="http://www.codexwriters.com/">Codex</a> writers’ community, which has hugely expanded my horizons and understanding of the industry. The more I write, the less I trust myself to be a good judge of my work’s quality, and the more I seek out and appreciate feedback from others.</p>

<h3 id="write-smart-not-just-hard">Write smart, not just hard</h3>

<p>Some writers recommend keeping insane writing regimens, cranking out thousands of words a day, saying it’s the only way to improve. And I wrote a fair amount this year. But stepping back and getting feedback on my work was just as important.</p>

<p>I had a music teacher who used to ask: “Did you practice ten hours, or just the same hour ten times?” When I took time to evaluate my work and deliberately build on it, I improved faster than just by vomiting words indiscriminately onto the page.</p>

<h3 id="keep-reading-good-prose">Keep reading good prose</h3>

<p>No, I didn’t read a hundred books again this year. But I did try to keep my ear filled with good prose. For example, this summer I got on a southern realist kick: Flannery O’Connor, Eudora Welty, Carson McCullers. Studying how those writers crafted characters and situations helped me nail down a couple of southern-set stories that ended up selling. My science fiction writing improved more from reading good writers, period, than from reading science fiction.</p>

<h3 id="just-because-you-wrote-something-good-enough-to-get-published-somewhere-that-doesn-t-mean-the-next-thing-you-write-won-t-be-terrible">Just because you wrote something good enough to get published somewhere, that doesn’t mean the next thing you write won’t be terrible</h3>

<p>This sounds stupid in hindsight, but for a long time I had it in my head that once I sold a story, I’d have figured out what it took to get published, and I wouldn’t have any trouble after that. Instead, I still get tons of rejections, and often my writing seems just as lifeless and terrible to me as it did before I sold my first story.</p>

<p>The good news is that with practice, the overall trend appears to be upward. At least, when I look back at my work from the beginning of the year, I can’t believe how bad it is. So I must be improving, right?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>Like many people who start out in the short fiction game, I would love to publish a novel. So I think that might be a 2019 goal. But I’m sure I’ll continue to write short stories, too. There’s real satisfaction in creating something that you can hold in your head all at once, knowing how it will turn out and why it’s effective.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my line of work, we talk a lot about security warning design and
effectiveness. Usually, the task of a warning is to prevent a user from doing
something dangerous, such as accepting an invalid certificate or installing
malware. There’s another class of warnings which tell users that something bad
has <em>already</em> happened, with the aim of helping them recover. I’ll call this
category <strong>after-the-fact warnings</strong>.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about after-the-fact warnings, such as best practices for how
to design them or how effective they can be. In fact I know so little that I had
to make up a name for this category of warnings, when there probably already
exists a fancy academic name. So I
<a href="https://twitter.com/estark37/status/1301545990848094208">asked</a> for some
research pointers on Twitter and collected an interesting reading list. I’ll
summarize some of my observations here. Note that this isn’t a comprehensive
survey – just some thoughts from the papers that caught my eye the most.</p>



<p>To set the stage, here are some real world examples of after-the-fact warnings.
Again, this isn’t comprehensive, just some examples that I can think of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Antivirus notifications telling people that they have malware on their device</li>
  <li>Password breach notifications, either from a first-party (LinkedIn notifying
users that their LinkedIn password has been leaked) or third-party service
provider (<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">HaveIBeenPwned</a>,
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/12/better-password-protections-in-chrome.html">a web browser</a>)</li>
  <li>Chrome has a feature
(“<a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/new-security-protections-tailored-you/">predictive phishing protection</a>”)
that notices when you type a saved password on a suspected phishing site and
warns you that you may have been phished and should change your password. This
is similar to a password breach notification, but has some different
considerations because the suspected attack is phishing rather than credential
stuffing.</li>
  <li>Other (non-password) data breach notifications, for example an email from
Equifax telling people that their personal data has been leaked</li>
  <li>Some browsers have persistent UI telling the user that they’ve bypassed a
security warning in the past. For example, after a person clicks through a
certificate, phishing, or malware warning in Chrome, the address bar shows a
red “Not Secure” chip to let them know that they’re in an unsafe state. It
might be a bit of a stretch to call this an after-the-fact warning, as it’s
not clear what action the warning is asking the user to take.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
  <img src="https://emilymstark.com/assets/after_cert_error.png" alt="Chrome UI after bypassing a certificate error">
  <figcaption><i>Google
Chrome UI after bypassing a certificate error. The page loads normally but the
address bar shows a red “Not Secure” chip to emphasize that the user is in an
unsafe state.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, there are some interesting hypothetical examples of after-the-fact
warnings, which is what originally got me interested in this area.
<a href="https://emilymstark.com/2020/07/20/certificate-transparency-a-birds-eye-view.html">Certificate Transparency</a>
introduces an asynchronous certificate verification step. The browser might
accept a certificate as valid, but then find out that it was actually not valid,
days or weeks later. It’s generally been considered beyond the pale for the
browser to warn the user at this point. How might the browser communicate that a
website the user visited in the past was potentially compromised? What is the
user supposed to do about it? I think the answer to these questions is probably
that the browser shouldn’t try to communicate this message, because it’s too
hard to understand and there’s nothing the user can be expected to do about it.
But I’m not totally sure that’s the right answer, and that’s what got me
interested in how successful after-the-fact warnings can be.</p>



<p>I read 5 papers on this topic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.mobsec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/mobsec/veroeffentlichungen/2018/09/10/ccsf266-finalv1.pdf">“What was that site doing with my Facebook password?” Designing Password-Reuse Notifications</a> <em>Golla et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes two surveys about notifications that companies send
when they discover a user’s password in a password dump from another
service. The first survey studies representative examples of real-world
notifications, and the second survey uses a model notification designed
using the lessons from the first survey. Comprehension was pretty poor
across the board. Most users reported that they would change their
password upon receiving the model notification, but very few said they
would change their password to something unrelated. (And of course,
surveys don’t always give us the best information about what someone would
do in real life.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2020/ConPro/papers/bhagavatula-conpro20.pdf">(How) Do People Change Their Passwords After a Breach?</a> <em>Bhagavatula et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper makes use of the Security Behavior Observatory, which is a
large group of participants who have agreed to run research software on
their machines to collect information about their security behaviors. This
allowed the researchers to observe how many users changed their password
when their accounts were actually breached in real life. The answer is
that not so many participants did change their passwords (33%), and of
those, many participants didn’t do so for quite a long time after the
breach.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=8835359">“Should I Worry?” A Cross-Cultural Examination of Account Security Incident Response</a> <em>Redmiles</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes a set of interviews with Facebook users from 5
countries. The interviewers asked participants about how they responded to
notifications from Facebook that their account had a suspicious login.
These notifications tell the user that their account may have been
compromised and then ask them to complete a secondary authentication task,
such as identifying photos of their friends. One finding that particularly
caught my eye was that, when asked what alerted them to the suspicious
login, participants sometimes identified the secondary authentication task
rather than the initial notification. The paper hypothesizes that this may
be due to warning fatigue blinding users to the initial notification.
(Warning fatigue is when users see many warnings and get habituated to
them, ceasing to take action on them.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://lersse-dl.ece.ubc.ca/record/316/files/CHI-17_huh_paper.pdf">I’m too Busy to Reset my LinkedIn Password: On the Effectiveness of Password Reset Emails</a> <em>Huh et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper describes a Mechanical Turk survey of participants who had
received password breach notifications from LinkedIn. For a methodological
contrast, “‘What was that site doing with my Facebook password?’ Designing
Password-Reuse Notifications” asked people what they would do
hypothetically, and “(How) Do People Change Their Passwords After a
Breach?” observed what people actually did (with a slight caveat that
there were some heuristics used to figure out what people actually did
from the available data). In this Huh et al. paper, the researchers asked
people to recall what they did. Each of these methods has its pros and
cons; asking people to recall what they did can suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_bias">recall
bias</a>, though in this case the
authors took some steps to combat this bias by asking participants to
provide screenshots to verify that they had actually received the
notification and changed their password (if applicable). The results
showed a somewhat higher rate of password change (~50%) than other work,
but identified some other themes in common with other work: a substantial
delay before participants took action, and a tendency to choose weak or
related passwords when they did eventually change their password.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://yixinzou.github.io/publications/chi2019-zou.pdf">You ‘Might’ Be Affected: An Empirical Analysis of Readability and Usability Issues in Data Breach Notifications</a> <em>Zou et al.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This paper analyzes a dataset of real-world data breach notifications
downloaded from government databases. Most were mailed notifications.
Because I’m mostly interested in experimental results from electronic
notifications, I only skimmed this paper. The paper compiles a list of
best practices and recommendations for notification design (such as using
clear and concise language and highlighting key information visually) as
well as public policy (such as encouraging that notifications are
delivered across multiple channels). These recommendations seem to broadly
make sense, but I would be hesitant to apply them too dogmatically to
computer security warnings without verifying them experimentally.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, there’s a body of adjacent work about vulnerability and
misconfiguration notifications sent to server operators. For example, Durumeric
et al. conducted an experiment notifying 150,000 server operators that their
servers were vulnerable to the Heartbleed vulnerability. I’m more familiar with
this area of research because I’ve done work in it
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/06a75f932595f27a60092007965934c957b5de21.pdf">myself</a>.
My overall impression is that the effectiveness of this type of notifications
varies quite widely depending on the severity and urgency of the issue and the
effort needed to remedy it. Regardless, I view this area as mostly tangential
because I’m particularly interested in after-the-fact warnings for end users,
which is a substantially different population than server operators.</p>



<p>Here’s a collection of questions that I was hoping to find in these papers but
didn’t:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a bit of an elephant in the room: <strong>is it possible for users to
actually recover once they’ve been compromised?</strong> Most of the work I described
above focuses on getting users to complete a particular action, such as
changing their password to a new, strong, unique password. But what if that’s
not enough? Data may have already been leaked or the account’s integrity
violated. The Redmiles paper (“‘Should I Worry?’”) touches on this issue by
describing follow-up actions that participants performed to verify their
account integrity, such as checking whether any unauthorized messages had been
sent from their account. But I think the research community hasn’t grappled
with what’s involved in truly recovering from an account compromise, and I
could spend a long time meditating on whether it makes sense to do
after-the-fact warnings at all if we don’t know what to tell users to do to
recover. (Also relevant: my colleague Chris Palmer pondering
<a href="https://noncombatant.org/2019/08/24/recoverability/">recoverability</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>How well do antivirus notifications work?</strong> When AV software pops up a
warning that the user has some malware installed, how likely are users to
comprehend the risks and respond effectively? (And, reiterating the elephant
in the room, what does “effectively” even mean in this case?) …</li></ul></div></div>

September 7, 2020 | https://notes.eatonphil.com/the-case-for-comments-in-code.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://notes.eatonphil.com/the-case-for-comments-in-code.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <div>
        <p>When I first started programming, especially when asked for code
samples, my comments lacked purpose and would often duplicate in
English what the code clearly indicated. I knew that "commenting is
good" but as a beginner I had no further insight.</p>
<p>Over time with the help of books like Clean Code, I grew disdainful of
comments. Good code should be self-documenting. Whenever I needed to
write a comment to explain something, I'd realize I could easily
rename some key variable or function. I grew more comfortable with
variables and functions with a few words in the title. Better to spend
time on good code structure and naming.</p>
<p>
  I have always left TODOs though, since TODOs can't so easily be
  expressed in variable names. But even these TODOs concerned me
  because they existed in my issue tracker, or maybe should have.
</p><p>As I watched mature open source projects and mature engineers, I came
to value well-documented pull requests. Solid pull requests include or
link to all necessary background, opportunities failed or ignored, how
to use, links to external bugs requiring workarounds and the results
of performance evaluation.</p>
<p>Beyond pull request descriptions, when I really wanted to grease a
pull request I'd use the pull request UI to add comments calling
reviewer attention to key changes in lines of the diff.</p>
<p>Both kinds of guidance are a massive aid to reviewers, saving a lot of
time.</p>
<p>But when I'd find a bug in code -- and I knew there was good pull
request documentation, even for pull requests as recent as six months
ago -- I've been repeatedly failed by the pull request and <em>pull
request comment</em> search exposed by Github and Gitlab.</p>
<p>I <em>knew</em> there were links to documented oddities or bug reports in
pull request threads. But practically speaking, for historic pull
requests, pull request comments are useless.</p>
<p>This is the single biggest reason I've started to push for more
comments in code. More so than all other tools (issue tracker, code
management system, etc.) comments in code have the greatest chance of
still being around and <em>easily searchable</em> if they haven't been
deleted.</p>
<p>
  Don't get me started on pull request documentation in an external
  medium like Slack. It's so rewarding to get or give instant feedback
  on changes on instant messengers, but good luck finding that
  discussion 3 months later.
</p><p>Every time I have to call out a line of code in a pull request, that's
immediate cause for that code to be modified with comments.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn't do this if Github/Gitlab exposed a Google Docs-like
interface for browsing code line by line with links to all pull

						<p>For a while now, all of my MacBooks have run extremely hot and the fans have gone nuts. While <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/category/troubleshooting/"></a><a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/troubleshooting/">troubleshooting</a> the issue, Activity Monitor showed that an app named <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">reportcrash</a> has run very high on the CPU and has killed my battery life. Force quitting the app didn’t help as it would start right back up in a few seconds and climb back to 80-100% usage of the CPU.</p>
<h2>What is CrashReporter?</h2>
<p>CrashReporter runs in any time an application crashes and it’s designed to saves the application state to aid developers in working out why the app crashed. Basically aÂ&nbsp;process isÂ&nbsp;launching, crashing (and invoking CrashReporter) and then re-launching, repeating this cycle never ending.</p>
<h2>How to Identify What’s Crashing</h2>
<p>To show which process is triggering this cycle and stop it, CrashReporter is pretty verbose in its logging which makesÂ&nbsp;finding the problem app somewhat easier. Open up the <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/console/">console</a>.app (/<a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/category/admin/windows/applications/"></a><a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/applications/">Applications</a>/<a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/category/admin/windows/utilities/">Utilities</a>/<a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/console/">Console</a>.app) and look towards the end of your system.log to see what app is crashing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, the problem is a driver by some company called EFI and getting the latest drivers didn’t resolve the issue. The next obvious solution was to disable <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">reportcrash</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Disable <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">ReportCrash</a></h2>
<p>Fire up <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/category/admin/linux/ssh/terminal-ssh/"></a><a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/category/admin/mac-admin/terminal/"></a><a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/terminal/">terminal</a> and run the following commands to disable <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">reportcrash</a>:</p>
<pre title="How to Disable ReportCrash OSX">launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.<a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">ReportCrash</a>.plist
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.<a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">ReportCrash</a>.Root.plist</pre>
<h2>How to Enable <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">ReportCrash</a></h2>
<p>If you need to reenable crash report, run the following commands in <a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/category/admin/linux/ssh/terminal-ssh/"></a><a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/category/admin/mac-admin/terminal/"></a><a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/terminal/">terminal</a>:</p>
<pre title="Enable Reportcrash">launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.<a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">ReportCrash</a>.plist
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.<a href="https://www.gregoryvarghese.com/tag/reportcrash/">ReportCrash</a>.Root.plist</pre>

I'm your host Lukas Biewald. Jeremy Howard created the Fast.ai course, which is maybe the most popular course to learn machine learning and there are a lot out there. He's also the author of the book Deep Learning for Coders with Fast.ai and PyTorch and in that process, he made the Fast.ai library which lots of people use independently to write deep learning. Before that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Enlitic, an exciting startup that applies deep learning to health care applications. And before that, he was the president of Kaggle, one of the most exciting earliest machine learning companies. I'm super excited to talk to him. So Jeremy, it's nice to talk to you. And in preparing the questions, I realized that every time I've talked to you there have been a few gems that I've remembered that I would never think to ask about. Like one time you told me about how you learned Chinese and another time you gave me Dad parenting advice, very specific advice and it's been actually super helpful. </p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh great. Tell me what Dad parenting advice worked out?</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Well, what you told me was when you change diapers, use a blow dryer to change a really frustrating experience to a really joyful experience and it's like such good advice. I don't know how you.. I guess I can imagine how you thought of it, but it's...</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, yeah, I know they love the whooshing sound, they love the warmth. I'm kind of obsessed about Dad things. So I'm always happy to talk about Dad things. That is this podcast.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>Can we start with that? Now that my daughter is eight months old. Do you have any suggestions for her?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Oh my goodness! Eight months old. You know, it's like the same with any kind of learning. It's all about consistency. So I think that the main thing we did right with Claire was just, you know, this delightful child now is we were just super consistent. Like if we said you can't have X unless you do Y, we would never give her X if she didn't do Y. If you want to take your scooter down to the bottom of the road, you have to carry it back up again. We read this great book that was saying if you're not consistent, it becomes like this thing, it's like a gambler. It's like sometimes you get the thing you want, so you just have to keep trying so that's my number one piece of advice. It's the same with teaching machine learning. We always tell people that tenacity is the most important thing for students. To stick with it, do it every day.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>I guess just in the spirit of questions, I'm genuinely curious about, you know, you've built this amazing framework and teaching thing that I think is maybe the most popular and most appreciated framework. I was wondering if you could start by telling me the story of what inspired you to do that and what was the journey to making Fast.ai, the curriculum and Fast.ai, the ML framework.</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>So it was something that my wife Rachel and I started together. Rachel has a math PhD, super technical background, early data scientist and engineer, Uber. I don't. I have just scraped by a philosophy undergrad and have no technical background. But from both of our different directions, we both had this frustration that neural networks in 2012 were super important, clearly going to change the world, but super inaccessible and so we would go to meetups and try to figure out like how do we... Like I knew the basic idea, I'd coded neural networks 20 years ago, but how do you make them really good? There wasn't any open source software at the time for running on GPUs. You know, Dan Seresen's thing was available, but you had to pay for it. There was no source code and we just thought, oh, we've got to change this, because the history of technology leaps has been that it generally increases inequality because the people with resources can access the new technology and then that leads to societal upheaval and a lot of unhappiness. So we thought, well, we should just do what we can. So we thought how are we going to fix this? Basically the goal was, and still is, to be able to use deep learning without requiring any code so that, you know, because the vast majority of the world can't code, we kind of thought, well, to get there, we should, first of all, see what exists right now? Learn how to use it as best as we can ourselves, teach people how to best use it as we can and then make it better, which requires doing research and then turning that into software and then changing the course to teach the hopefully slightly easier version and repeat that again and again for a few years. And so we're kind of in that process.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>That's so interesting. Do you worry that the stuff you're teaching, you're sort of trying to make it obsolete, right? Because you're trying to build higher level abstractions? Like I think one of the things that people really appreciate your course is that it's really clear, in-depth explanations of how these things work. Do you think that that's eventually going to be not necessary or how do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Jeremy: </strong>Yeah, to some extent. I mean, so if you look at the new book and the new course, chapter one starts with really, really foundational stuff around what is a machine learning algorithm? What do we mean to learn an algorithm? What's the difference between traditional programming and machine learning to solve the same problem? And those kinds of basic foundations I think will always be useful, even at the point you're not using any code. I feel like even right now, if somebody is using like PlatformAI or some kind of code-free framework, you still need to understand these basics of an algorithm can only learn based on the data you provide. It's generally not going to be able to extrapolate to patterns it's not seen yet, stuff like that. Um, but yeah, I mean, we have so far released two new courses every year, you know, a part one and part two every year because every year, it's totally out of date. And we always say to our students at the start of part one, Look, you know, none of the details you're learning are going to be of any use in a year or two's time. There's a time when we're doing Piano and then TensorFlow and Keras, and then playing PyTorch. We always say, look, don't worry too much about the software we're using because none of it's still any good, you know, it's goal changing rapidly, you know, faster than JavaScript frameworks, but the concepts are important and yeah, you can pick up a new library and I don't know by weekend, I …</p></div></div>

<h2>The Problem</h2>



<p>If you lead a software team, then a significant part of your tasks will involve some sort of bug fixing or support for other teams. In particular, if your team works on a product used by a lot of customers, you can expect to sped 10% or more of your team’s time fixing bugs from your customers.</p>



<p>When it comes to bug fixing, your customers expect a high standard from your team, so you should expect the same from them. As part of your team lead duties, you need to look for opportunities to reduce the team’s work as much as possible. In my case, I discovered that the team spent longer trying to understand a bug’s description than actually fixing it.</p>



<p>A poorly written bug means your team is getting distracted trying to figure out what the bug means instead of fixing it. Distraction leads to context switching leads to frustration leads to slower completion of work. And there are few things more distracting than a badly written bug.</p>



<p>Rather than trying to fix the bug, a lot of time is wasted trying to understand the bug’s context and the steps leading up to the incident. In the end, your team practically writes the bad bug themselves!</p>



<p>This was the case for the product I worked on a few years ago. Although the product was relatively mature, there was very little structure around the processes used to make the product better.</p>



<p>A quick search through the bugs history showed poorly written one-liner bugs marked as closed with no explanation or code fix attached. Clearly, the developers were conversing directly with the stakeholders via email and not attaching the information afterwards.</p>



<p>When my team joined the product, the most frustrating part of our days was solving bug tickets which had no useful information attached. Furthermore, we had no method of prioritising our bugs against our current list of tasks – the loudest person won the priority. </p>



<p>After 2 months of this and identifying it as a major pain point in our retros, we decided to fix our bug process.</p>



<h2>The Bug Template</h2>



<p>Our bug template was revolutionary to our workflow. First of all, by filling in a template, the bug author was required to think about their problem.</p>



<p>What did I do leading up to this? <br>How could this have happened?</p>



<p>Occasionally, the bug author even figured out the solution by themselves while filling in the template.</p>



<p>Secondly, the bug ticket required some effort to create. A good rule we discovered was if you make it easy for someone to do something, they will do it. In this case, if you make it easy to create bad bugs, then bad bugs will get created.</p>



<p>By putting a list of questions to answer in the template, the author is less inclined to raise trivial questions since it would be quicker to figure it out themselves. Most importantly, you won’t be left with some ‘critical’ bugs that just have a one-liner description.</p>



<pre><strong>Bug Logging Template</strong>

<p>Whenever you see a badly written bug, attach the following to the comments section:</p>



<p>“Hi Sam, We need more information to begin working on this quickly. Please fill out this template with relevant details.” Then paste in the above template.</p>



<h2>Prioritise Your Bugs</h2>



<p>As the team lead, each day you should work with your team to identify the highest priority work. If critical bugs are coming in, you may need to down-prioritise other tasks.</p>



<p>I have a general rule I use to decide what to prioritise: </p>



<p>“If it hurts, put it first.” </p>



<p>If the ticket is a big customer or is likely to cause your team embarrassment, then get it closed out asap. It is important to keep the pressure off your team as much as possible, so getting painful bugs closed quickly can give them the head space they need.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there is little point in having your team work on edge case bugs that were accidentally found in-house when there are customers shouting for a fix on another bug.</p>



<h2>Argue Against the Bug</h2>



<p>Before you assign any bug to your team, make sure it is something suitable for your team to work on. Don’t confuse a ‘loud’ bug with a high priority bug. Very often, there are stakeholders that create tickets and need them worked on immediately. Always question the validity of their priority.</p>



<p>Firstly, you don’t want to be the ‘pushover team’ that will hop on tickets when someone shouts loud enough. It is very beneficial to your team if you can disagree against tickets with the hope of either delaying their priority (especially if your have a large backlog) or get it moved to a more relevant team.</p>



<p>To argue against the bug, ask a few simple questions:</p>



<ul><li>Is this bug for your team?</li><li>Is there enough info for someone to begin working on it?</li><li>What level of expertise is required here (senior / junior)?</li></ul>



<p>By asking some basic questions, your team gets more context to the ticket and can empathise with the ticket author. If the ticket does not already have your template, make sure you attach it and ask the author to fill it out.</p>



<h2>Emails are not Bugs!</h2>



<p>As the team lead, I am often pulled into an email chain with stakeholders such as QA or customer support teams with questions such as:</p>



<ul><li>“David – Can you get someone to have a look at these logs?”</li><li>“David – Can we secure someone from your team to look at this?”</li><li>“David – It is critical that we fix this bug by Monday. Who is available to work over the weekend?”</li></ul>



<p>Do not take requests like this. My response is always the same:</p>



<ul><li>“I’m sure we can help. Please raise a ticket with all relevant details so that we can track this.”</li></ul>



<p>Without a ticket, your team don’t know where to attach their information or ask more questions. Moreover, if you revisit the bug in the future, without a ticket there is nothing for you to reference.</p>

<p>What are Walmart Sponsored Products and where do they come into play? Walmart allows advertisers to easily advertise on their platforms with this feature being a really lucrative option for them. We’ll discuss what it entails, how they work and the different ad formats that can be selected for the different types of campaigns you’re choosing to run.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s begin!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What are Walmart Sponsored Products?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Walmart Sponsored Products are also called Performance Ads, and they are also known as <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-ad-costs/">cost-per-click ads</a> that can appear on the Walmart Marketplace. They are able to appear within search results, category pages, and product pages on Walmart’s app, mobile site, and desktop site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When utilizing these types of ads, they are able to increase your visibility by allowing you to reach and engage shoppers at all stages of their shopping journey. The ads appear on the first page of search results too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If anything, you’re not only advertising your products, but you’re also helping consumers find and purchase products in a much easier and convenient manner. Plus, the advertiser will only have to pay when the shopper clicks on the ad. It’s quite the win-win situation!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Do <strong>Walmart Sponsored Products</strong> Work?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>So, how are these sponsored products selected for exposure to your customers? They are actually based on a combination of relevancy and bid. They also rely on the following two factors.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Products being advertised must win the buy box&nbsp;</li><li>Products being advertised must be in stock&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These cool ads are designed to help you do the following too.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Boost product sales&nbsp;</li><li>Increase share of wallet&nbsp;</li><li>Uncover new customers&nbsp;</li><li>Grow or protect market share&nbsp;</li><li>Maximize profitable SKUs&nbsp;</li><li>Improve brand and product visibility&nbsp;</li><li>Launch new products or brand extensions&nbsp;</li><li>Present your products to a massive audience already ready to purchase&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Which benefit are you to achieve in your <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-search-advertising/">advertising campaign</a>? We’d love to know your thoughts and your mission to execute your own products to potential customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Types of Walmart Sponsored Products</strong></h2>



<p>With all of the great <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capabilities</a> this type of advertising has to offer, there are also different formats in the way they can be executed. This is perfect for those who are interested in various campaign ideas and need a mix of how to present their product launches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are all of the following ways Walmart Sponsored Products may be used on the online platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Search In-Grid: </em>&nbsp;</strong>Did you know that one in four online Walmart purchases begin with a search? This type of ad allows for your product to get the premium placement on the first page of search results.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Brand Amplifier: </em></strong>This type of ad really helps to provide brand recognition and showcase your product portfolio. The logo, custom headline and up to three of the SKUs appear at the top of relevant search results.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Product Carousel: </em></strong>&nbsp;The product appears on search, category and item pages as relevant alternate purchase options. This is an ad that appears as more of a disguise and it gives the customer options.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Buy Box: </em></strong>&nbsp;This ad will have your products appear at the most relevant alternate purchase option on product detail pages.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Two Different Campaign Types</strong></h2>



<p>When looking at how to set up the overall campaigns, there are two different methods that Walmart offers to advertisers. Look at the following to see what will work best for your current needs in product/brand awareness. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Automatic: </em></strong>This is a method in the way a campaign runs where the advertiser doesn’t have to monitor as heavily as if it were manual. It’s set to serve all customers searching for products like yours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This specific type of campaign is perfect for brands that are new to the advertising field. They hope to widen their existing customer base or are launching a product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are a few of its features that advertisers look for when running their campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Easy setup&nbsp;</li><li>No keyword management&nbsp;</li><li>High impression volume&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Manual: </em></strong>On the other hand, manual advertising is set to serve to customers based on their select keyword choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an ideal situation for brands who have products with a long history on Walmart or brands that already know the successful keywords in their customer use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are a few of its features that advertisers look for when running their campaign.</p>



<ul><li>Access to Walmart’s Keyword Analytics tool</li><li>Select your own keywords&nbsp;</li><li>Full campaign control&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Do you think that Walmart Sponsored Products are right for you?&nbsp;Contact a <a href="https://jungletopp.com/walmart-ads-agency/">Walmart ads agency</a> to talk about launching your ad campaigns.</p>



<p>We find that with the combination of different ways to execute the ads as well as having Walmart being a powerhouse for a variety of products, it’s always going to be desirable to a large number of consumers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, with the different bidding keywords and use of CPC, advertisers will have much more financial freedom. They’ll also be able to measure their results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us know your final thoughts to this method of advertising and if you have or are considering this method for your own campaign.</p>

<p>“If you can’t code, what do you do?” I often get this question when I say I went to a hackathon. The simple answer is twofold: partner with developers to make sure you’re getting the right stuff done; and surround great code with a concise and compelling business story. There are other ways to go about it, but in general you have to be enormously flexible and wear many hats with various levels of comfort.</p>
<p>At the Sudo Hackathon, I had the pleasure of working with a genuinely incredible team. The prompt was: “How can virtual reality be utilised in health and infrastructure?” Our team worked on a healthcare tool for macular dystrophy&nbsp;<strong>–</strong> the number one cause of vision loss in people over 50.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, our team created four key deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li>A retinal-mapping game using Google Cardboard</li>
<li>An algorithm to quickly and precisely define patient blind spot borders</li>
<li>A real-Time video morphing visualization</li>
<li>A 5-minute pitch presentation including business case</li>
</ul>
<p>We were able to track down an eye surgeon and prepare patient-focused and physician-focused questions. The information informed our MVP (minimum viable product), then we just needed the facts to back up our story. For example, sight loss is a 28 billion GBP market in the UK alone. The NHS also had an upcoming grant our product would be eligible for, an incredibly desirable path for extending our runway without diluting our equity.</p>
<p>Up until the last minute we were building, refining, adding, and editing. Our team had that contagious feeling of great code being stitched together. To quote one of my teammates: “This code is magic.” With only one previous run-through, we went in front of the judges, and we WON!</p>
<p>It was a great feeling for everyone on the team to leave the hackathon in equal parts excited and exhausted. Lots of gratitude to Allia for hosting this Serious Impact Challenge Weekend in partnership with the European Union’s European Regional Development Fund. It was an amazing event, and I highly encourage people to check out their <a href="https://www.sudochallenge.com/">next event</a> in Agritech this April.</p>

	September 1st, 2020

<h5><i>A bored high-schooler's foray into astronomy, because what else was I supposed to do during lockdown?</i></h5>

			<img src="https://ken-myers.github.io/assets/images/starmapPretty.png">
		
		
			<figcaption>Distance optimized map of the 10 closest stars to Earth, Sol included. This one has an average error of around 8.9% </figcaption>
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>There was something of a family debate over whether a reduced-dimensionality starmap could still be accurate enough as to be useful, so I made a covid-quarantine experiment of it.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>The idea is pretty simple: create a 2D starmap in which the distances between each star are as accurate as possible.</p>

<div>
	<figure>

			<figcaption>Generation of a map of our 30 nearest stars.</figcaption>
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>I tried to implement something like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map">Kohonen map</a>. I’m not sure if it actually falls under that name, but it does follow the same principles of iteratively changing the position of each node towards a more ideal state, which in this case would be one in which the distances between each pair on the board are most accurate. Here’s my algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Randomly initialize each item’s position.</li>
  <li>Repeat the following n times or until convergence:
    <ul>
      <li>For each item in the dataset:
        <ol>
          <li>Calculate and store the average pairwise error (discrepancy between true distance and distance on the map) between the given item and all other items.</li>
          <li>Shift the item’s position by a certain increment in both directions on each axis, calculating and storing the item’s average error for each possible move.</li>
          <li>Commit the move which yields the lowest error, and move onto the next item.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If the average error of the whole map has not changed since last iteration, either
        <ul>
          <li>Decrease the increment size if the results will still be significant, or otherwise</li>
          <li>Stop. The map’s error has converged.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A few nuances have been glossed over in this overview. You can view the full code on <a href="https://github.com/ken-myers/stargen">my Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>One of the principal arguments against the usability of these maps was that “it’s like putting cities in a line.” I made sure to generalize my code for data of any dimension and fed it the largest 20 cities in Texas. If you’re from around here, I think you’d agree with me that this map looks like it’d be helpful to any one-dimensional creatures attempting to traverse the state.</p>

<div>
	<figure>
		
		
		
		
		<p><img src="https://ken-myers.github.io/assets/images/linearCities.png">
		</p>
		
			<figcaption>The 20 largest cities in Texas plotted linearly, optimized for distance. (The Metroplex is a bit clustered, as expected.)</figcaption>
		
	</figure>
</div>

<p>Here are a few more of the starmaps I’ve generated, without any post-processing. (You can click on any of these to view them in more detail.)</p>


<p>As for the error indication, the blue lines represent specific distances that are over a user-inputted threshold (in this case, 85%), the red text simply lists the average error of all distances involving the given star, and the red halos are proportional to said error. All of this is toggle-able.</p>

<p>Something to note is that these maps are quite sensitive to initial conditions, so you may have to re-roll a few times until you get a map you’re happy with. In my experience, the average map error for a given dataset could fall anywhere between 10-30%, but I’m sure this number changes when you’re working with something other than stars or cities.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-starmaps">Beyond Starmaps</h2>

<p>Even though the code is capable, there’s not much use in stepping down higher-dimensional data to one, two, or three dimensions because, since it is primarily intended to be used as a cartography tool, my program does not normalize the data you feed it, and uniform higher dimensional coordinates are hard to come by. (If you were, say, a novelist trying to world-build a universe in which there were seven spatial dimensions, then yes, it could be useful.)</p>

<p>I intend to continue working on this project. Besides the obvious refactoring, bug-squashing, and polishing, I’d also like to add support for wrap-around/toroidal space and perhaps globular, a GUI that shows live generation (like the GIF you saw earlier), and the ability to import CSV files.</p>

    <p>It takes roughly 2 weeks to form a habit; it takes roughly two weeks to get comfortable in a new environment. A common mistake is to treat a new report’s first couple weeks like college orientation - social, light hearted, get-to-know-you stuff. If your report spends the first two weeks reading C# documentation and having lunch out on the town with the team, guess what, they’ve just normalized that behavior as what the role is.</p>

<p>The answer: start your report doing real work as soon as possible. If they’re a software engineer, they should be committing code week one (ideally day 2 or 3); If they’re a product manager, they should be attending meetings and picking up supporting activities on a similar time frame. Then the tone has been set - working here means getting things done.</p>

<p>This means as manager you need to give your report tractable work in the first week. Managers not being ready for a report to start is the number one reason people end up normalizing underperformance, because they had nothing meaningful to do. If a manager describes a report as not having initiative in the first couple weeks it’s a red flag - it’s the manager’s job to provide new hires with clear paths to contribute immediately.</p>

<p>Another main reason people fall into onboarding traps is because your organization has painfully slow onboarding. Endless HR videos, slow security processes, a mountain of fragile technology setup - these all make for a shitty and counterproductive start at a company. Optimize your onboarding to get people doing what you hired them to do. Look to formalize performance indicators of your onboarding. For example, for engineers this could be time-to-first-commit and time-to-joining-sprints.</p>

<p>This approach holds for managers and executives as well. In that cohort it’s also common and a common red flag for people to spend the first couple weeks putzing around under the guise of “getting to know what’s going on”. Managers and executives should be involved in the decisions of the team from day 1 and developing artifacts - plans, TODO lists, strategy documents - in the first couple weeks. With good managers and executives you see them day 1 adding perspective and insight into conversations, and everyone collectively appreciates that the right person has been hired.</p>

<p>Onboarding is one of the most critical periods in a person’s time at a company. It’s one of the highest ROI periods when managing someone. Take that opportunity to set expectations properly and measure success quantiatively.</p>

      <article role="main">
        <p>This article is going to be an introduction to <strong>embedded Linux security</strong>.</p>
<p>Since this topic is quite extensive, I divided into two parts. In this first part, we will have a small introduction to security concepts and threat modeling and then focus on some mitigation techniques to improve the security of an embedded Linux device, including secure boot, code/data encryption and secure key storage.</p>
<p>If you prefer a one hour talk instead of reading this article, you can also watch the webinar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUKAgVKSxQ">“Introduction to embedded Linux security”</a> I recorded for <a href="https://www.toradex.com/">Toradex</a>. I also gave the same talk at Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020, but as I write this article it was not yet published on YouTube.</p>
<p>Let’s first start with some concepts…</p>
<h2 id="security-concepts">Security concepts</h2>
<p>Security is all about risk mitigation.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have <strong>owners</strong>, those who benefit from a product or service (user, manufacturer, business owner, etc). And owners want to protect <strong>assets</strong>, anything that has some value in the product or service (data, code, reputation, etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have <strong>threat actors</strong>, a person or thing (malicious hacker, government, etc) that can manifest a <strong>threat</strong>, anything that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm.</p>
<p>To manifest a threat, the threat actor will explore <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> (weakness in the system) via an <strong>attack vector</strong>, a method or pathway used by the threat actor to access or penetrate the target system.</p>
<p>The diagram below express very well all those concepts:</p>

<p>In the end, is a cat-and-mouse game between owners and threat actors. How far will the owner go to protect the assets? How far will the threat actor go to compromise the assets? It really depends on the value of the assets. Indeed, the perception of value may not be the same for owners and threat actors.</p>
<p>Identifying assets (and their value) to mitigate the risks of being compromised can be done in a process called <strong>threat modeling</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="threat-modeling">Threat modeling</h2>
<p>Threat modeling is a process where potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. It is basically a risk assessment process where you evaluate the value of your assets and the cost to protect them. The result of a threat modeling is the <strong>threat model</strong> of your product.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling.png" alt="Threat modeling"></p>
<p>There are several techniques and methodologies that can help during threat modeling, including STRIDE, DREAD, VAST, OCTAVE, and many others.</p>
<p>To have a very basic introduction to the topic, let’s talk about STRIDE and DREAD.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)">STRIDE model</a> is a very useful tool to help classify threats. It was developed by Microsoft and the name is an acronym for the six main types of threats: <strong>S</strong>poofing, <strong>T</strong>ampering, <strong>R</strong>epudiation, <strong>I</strong>nformation disclosure, <strong>D</strong>enial of service and <strong>E</strong>scalation of privileges. STRIDE can be used to identify all threats the assets of a system could be exposed to.</p>
<p><a href="https://allabouttesting.org/stride-acronym-of-threat-modeling-system/"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-stride.png" alt="STRIDE"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)">DREAD methodology</a> is a tool for risk-assessing computer security threats. The name is an acronym for five categories of security threats: <strong>D</strong>amage (how bad would an attack be), <strong>R</strong>eproducibility (how easy is it to reproduce the attack), <strong>E</strong>xploitability (how much work is it to launch the attack), <strong>A</strong>ffected users (how many people would be impacted) and <strong>D</strong>iscoverability (how easy is it to discover the threat).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/SecurityInnovation/threat-modeling-to-reduce-software-security-risk"><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-dread.png" alt="DREAD"></a></p>
<p>While the STRIDE model helps to identify the threats, the DREAD methodology helps to rank them. For each threat in the system, you would go over each threat category and classify it in low (1 point), medium (2 points), or high (3 points). In the end, you would have a ranked list of threats and mitigation strategies. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-threat-modeling-example.png" alt="Threat modeling example"></p>
<p>We can see that threat modeling will provide a very clear view of what we want to protect, how we plan to protect it, and associated costs. This is part of the <strong>threat model</strong> of the product, which needs to be re-evaluated for every development cycle. As a result, the threat model will provide a prioritized list of threats to work on, so we can focus on implementing the mitigations to improve the security of the product.</p>
<p>How to protect the integrity and authenticity of your code? How to ensure the privacy of the data? Where to store cryptographic keys? How to minimize the risks of an application to be exploited? Let’s try to answer all of those questions and many more, starting with secure boot!</p>
<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure Boot</h2>
<p>How to make sure the code you are running was built by a trustworthy person or company? Implementing a <strong>secure boot</strong> process.</p>
<p>The objective of a secure boot process is to protect the integrity and authenticity of the code.</p>
<p>Secure boot is usually based on the verification of digital signatures. An embedded Linux system normally has three major components: bootloader, kernel and root filesystem (rootfs). All these components are signed and the signatures are checked during boot.</p>
<p>For example, some hardware mechanism can be used to check the signature of the bootloader, that will check the signature of the kernel, that will use a ramdisk image to check the signature of the root filesystem. Since we have one component checking the signature of the next one in the boot chain, this process is often called a <strong>chain-of-trust</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-1.png" alt="Secure boot"></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a real example on an <a href="https://www.nxp.com/imx6">NXP iMX6</a> device.</p>
<p>Everything starts in the ROM code inside the SoC. On NXP iMX6, there is a hardware component called High Assurance Boot (HAB) that it is able to validate the signature of the first stage bootloader, making it possible to implement a secure boot process. The High Assurance Boot inside iMX6 devices can also be called the <strong>Root of Trust</strong>, since if it is compromised, all the secure boot process is also compromised.</p>
<p>The ROM code inside the iMX6 SoC, using the HAB component, will check the signature of the bootloader. For that, it is necessary to generate a pair of keys (public and private), sign the bootloader with the private key and store the public key inside the SoC. On iMX6, OTP fuses are used to store the keys. Actually, to make it less expensive, only the hash of the public key is stored in the SoC.</p>
<p>When the bootloader boots (e.g. <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot">U-Boot</a>), it will have to check the signature of the Linux kernel. For that, it is common to use an image format called <strong>FIT image</strong>. The FIT image is a container for multiple binaries with hashing and signature support, and usually contains the Linux kernel image, device tree files and an initial ramdisk. After generating a pair of keys, we need to sign the binaries inside the FIT image with the private key e configure U-Boot to use the public key to check the signature of the FIT image.</p>
<p>After the kernel boots, it will run the <em>init</em> program from the ramdisk image. The ramdisk will have the logic to verify the integrity of the final root filesystem before mounting it. There are some options to implement this. One common option is using the device-mapper verity (<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html">dm-verity</a>) kernel module. The <strong>dm-verity</strong> kernel module provides integrity checking of block devices and requires a read-only rootfs (squashfs can be a good solution). Other approaches would be <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Integrity_Measurement_Architecture">IMA</a> or <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-integrity.html">dm-integrity</a> if you want a read-write root filesystem.</p>
<p>Here is a diagram of the complete secure boot process:</p>
<p><img src="https://embeddedbits.org/images/20200906-secure-boot-2.png" alt="Secure boot on NXP iMX6"></p>
<p>This is only one example of a secure boot implementation, although it could be applied to a different set of boards and ARM SoCs.</p>
<p>Yet nothing is 100% secure!</p>
<p>Secure boot vulnerabilities in the ROM code of several NXP devices (i.MX6, i.MX50, i.MX53, i.MX7, i.MX28 and Vybrid families) were <a href="https://blog.quarkslab.com/vulnerabilities-in-high-assurance-boot-of-nxp-imx-microprocessors.html">publicly disclosed</a> on July 17th, 2017. And if your chain of trust is compromised, everything is compromised! So we need to be aware of these types of vulnerabilities (in this case, they were fixed with new silicon).</p>
<p>While secure boot ensures authenticity and integrity, it does not protect the device from being counterfeited or threat actors from extracting code/data from the device. So if you want to protect your intellectual property or ensure data confidentiality, you will need to use encryption.</p>
<h2 id="code-and-data-encryption">Code and data encryption</h2>
<p>You may want to encrypt data or code in an embedded Linux device.</p>
<p>Data encryption is a common approach when you need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the users. Data is any information generated during the executing of the device, including databases, configuration files, and so on.</p>
<p>Code encryption depends on the situation, and encrypting the full root filesystem is not that common. Usually, most of the components are free and open source software, so there is nothing to hide. There is also the issue of GPLv3 and Tivoization (using any GPLv3 software will force you to provide a mechanism for the user to update the software, and that would make it more difficult if you are encrypting it). A more common use case is to encrypt only the applications you developed for the device. It’s usually where your intellectual property is.</p>
<p>There are basically two main approaches to encryption in Linux: <strong>full disk encryption</strong> and <strong>file-based encryption</strong>.</p>
<p>Full disk encryption provides encryption at the block level and the whole disk or a disk partition is encrypted. For that, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt">dm-crypt</a>, the Linux kernel’s device mapper crypto target.</p>
<p>File-based encryption provides encryption at the file system level, where each directory may be separately and optionally encrypted with a different key. The two most common implementations of file-based encryption are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fscrypt">fscrypt</a> and <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ECryptfs">eCryptFS</a>. fscrypt is an API available on some filesystems like EXT4, UBIFS and F2FS, and eCryptFS is a more generic solution implemented as a layer that stacks on top of an existing filesystem.</p>
<p>But what about the keys used for encryption?</p>
<h2 id="encryption-keys">Encryption keys</h2>
<p>Since an asymmetric key algorithm is too slow to be used in encryption, usually a symmetric-key algorithm is used in encryption. That means the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and the key should be available somewhere in the filesystem so the encrypted code/data can be decrypted.</p>
<p>But we can’t just leave the key lying around in the filesystem, right?</p>
<p>There are several cases where companies …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

<p>So Ben Thompson<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> recently
<a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1302185265524617217">tweeted</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been using Android for the last couple of weeks, and honestly, the core OS is pretty good!</p>

  <p>The big problem is that Android apps are garbage relative to iOS apps.
If developers actually care about pushing back against Apple they should give a damn. They don’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then went on to attribute the garbage quality of Android apps to developer
laziness. This <em>understandably</em>
<a href="https://twitter.com/ZacSweers/status/1302082690179629057?s=20">infuriated</a> some of us #AndroidDev
unleashing the droid rage. To Ben’s credit, he has
<a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1302185265524617217?s=20">since deleted</a>
the specific tweet calling out developer laziness.</p>

<p>I’m not going to spend time dissecting his tweets<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. We are all human and
occasionally tweet dumb things. But there’s a shred of truth nestled in that
starting tweet that just got me thinking.</p>



<p>Serendipitously, I’ve been
<a href="https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal/status/1298692928081027072?s=20">thinking</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal/status/1298692084954587136?s=20">tweeting</a>
about similar things <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I’ll summarize the obvious points so we can get those out of the way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>iOS does better with <strong>privacy</strong> overall. It’s <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-may-have-ditched-encrypted-backups-google-hasnt">not always a slam
  dunk</a>
  but all things considered the Android experience is
  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/more-than-1000-android-apps-harvest-your-data-even-after-you-deny-permissions/">worse</a> on <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/35c3-9941-how_facebook_tracks_you_on_android/">this</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15141077">front</a>.</li>
  <li>iPhone hardware is better than Pixel hardware especially when it comes to integration
  with bluetooth accessories like the Apple Watch, AirPods, CarPlay etc.</li>
  <li>Camera is dicey. <em>I think</em> the Pixel shoots better still photos than the
  iPhone. The computational photography voodoo that Google does on pictures
  after the fact makes the photos more appealing to my eyes. iPhones still
  have the better Camera (hardware) though which is abundantly clear when
  you try to shoot videos.</li>
  <li>Siri is a steaming pile of garbage. It’s a crying shame how bad it is given the
  better hardware. Google Assistant alone makes me switch back to my Pixel
  time and again<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But there’s one important point that came up from this imbroglio that
has been hard to shake off …and wherein lies the more interesting argument:</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://twitter.com/kaushikgopal/status/1298692928081027072?s=20">original
tweet</a> I was
careful to say the iPhone has better “3rd party” apps.</p>

<p>Here’s a fair question to ask retorting that position: Give me examples of apps
that exist on both Android and iOS where the iOS experience is better?</p>

<p>Sure, I can give examples<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> where it’s true most of the time but my point is
subtly different. If I rephrase that question however, it helps make my
point better:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Give me the best “insert category” app on the iPhone and on the Pixel. Which
one do you think works better?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s try that for a few categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Give me the best Todo list app on the iPhone and Pixel. Which one do you think
  works better? (See <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>)</li>
  <li>Give me the best RSS feed reader app on the iPhone and Pixel. Which one do you
  think works better? (See <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>)</li>
  <li>Give me the best music making app on the iPhone and Pixel. Which one do you think
  works better? (See <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/">GarageBand</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some will immediately jump in defense saying this is subjective.</p>

<p>Sure… Maybe? I’m open to being challenged here. But I build Android apps for a
living and I mostly use an iPhone today as my daily driver, so take it for what
that’s worth. Also chatting with other (dev) friends, I’ve heard I’m not alone.</p>

<h2 id="so-why-are-iphone-apps-better">So why are iPhone apps better?</h2>

<h3 id="android-tools-are-worse">Android Tools are worse?</h3>

<p>Actually it’s the opposite! After dabbling with some iOS development, I can
confidently say Android Studio is <del>like a glass of ice water</del> much better
than Xcode<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. I also think Google as a company listens more closely and cares
about improving the developer experience. Many of their recent changes have been
in direct response to developer outcries.</p>

<p>How many iOS developers can say the same of Apple?</p>

<h3 id="android-devs-are-lazy">Android devs are lazy?</h3>

<p>Abso-fucking-lutely not.</p>

<p>I’d even go so far as to argue that Android
developers care way more about clean architecture and good engineering practices
than iOS developers. I mean I’m biased here but consider the fact that Android
devs are typically early adopters of industry best
practices like <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX">Rx</a>, MVI/Unidirectional State Flow,
Reactive UIs etc. You’ll find chatter, curiosity and first implementations
about these topics much earlier in the Android development community. But
here’s the rub:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iOS devs didn’t have to care about these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ios-devs-didnt-have-to-care">iOS devs didn’t have to care</h3>

<p>You want to know why Android devs jumped on Rx? Because every time you
hang for a few extra seconds on the main thread you would get hit with a gnarly
<a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr">ANR</a>. iPhones were
built to make single threaded processing blazingly fast. You can execute
database calls on the main thread and not worry for the most part. Try that on
an Android phone.</p>

<p>You want to know why Android devs have heated week long discussions about
Dependency Injection and Dagger? Because we can’t use constructors in our
classes! iOS devs think we’re crazy cause our ViewControllers don’t just take in
our dependencies.</p>

<p>You want to know why Android devs experiment and come up with all kinds of
different architectures to build apps? Because Google for the longest time
intentionally chose not to have an opinion. This changed in <strong>2017</strong>. You know
how long Android has been around? since 2005. 12 years, if you’re doing the math.</p>

<p>I also don’t need to reiterate the trope around Android being fragmented<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. While
we would spend nights battling platform specific bugs, our iOS counterparts
could spend their time focusing on silky smooth UIs. They had the luxury of
perfecting and polishing (and good on them for doing that). <code>minSdk 14</code> was
never a thing for iOS devs.</p>

<p>So yes, we might have better tools courtesy Android Studio but make no mistake
it is easier to build higher quality apps on iOS than it is on Android.</p>

<h2 id="one-more-thing">One more thing</h2>

<p>There’s also this other big factor that accounts for better third party apps:
iOS users are more willing to spend money through the app ecosystem. Android
may have the bigger market share today but <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iphone-users-spend-101-every-month-on-tech-purchases-nearly-double-of-android-users-according-to-a-survey-conducted-by-slickdeals-300739582.html?c=n">more money is spent through iPhones</a>.</p>

<p>If iPhone users are willing to spend more money, companies <strong>and
indie developers</strong> are going to spend more time and resources building iOS apps
instead of Android apps.  When more time and resources are spent instead on iOS
apps it follows that iOS is likely to have the better apps.</p>

<p>It’s harder technically to build a better Android app but Google is doing its
part to close that gap quickly. But unless Android users actually start
spending more money through apps, iOS is going to have the lead.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p><em>Quantum</em> <em>entanglement</em> is, as you know, a phrase that's jam-packed with meaning in physics. But what you might not know is that the linear algebra behind it is quite simple.&nbsp;If you're familiar with singular value decomposition (SVD), then you're 99% there. My goal for this post is to close that 1% gap. In particular, I'd like to explain something called the<em> </em><strong>Schmidt rank</strong> in the hopes of helping the math of entanglement feel a little less... tangly. And to do so, I'll ask that you momentarily forget about the previous sentences. Temporarily ignore the title of this article. Forget we're having a discussion about entanglement. Forget I mentioned that word. And let's start over. Let's just chat math. </p><p>Let's talk about SVD. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Value Decomposition</h2><p>SVD is arguably one of the most important, well-known tools in linear algebra. You are likely already very familiar with it, but here's a lightning-fast recap. Every matrix $M$ can be factored as $M=UDV^\dagger$ as shown below, called the <strong>singular value decomposition</strong> of $M$. The entries of the diagonal matrix $D$ are nonnegative numbers called <em>singular values</em>, and the number of them is equal to the rank of $M$, say $k$. What's more, $U$ and $V$ have exactly $k$ columns, called the <em>left and right singular vectors</em>, respectively.</p><figure id="w-node-c5cffac943b5-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5562528e82aa6ab6d78ae1_open.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>There are different ways to think about this, depending on which applications you have in mind. I like to think of singular vectors as encoding meaningful "concepts" inherent to $M$, and of singular values as indicating how important those concepts are. For instance, this perspective arises naturally in a study of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10531">learning dynamics of deep neural networks</a>. As another example, you can imagine a matrix whose rows are indexed by people, and whose columns are indexed by movies.&nbsp;The $ij$th entry could be a 0 or 1, indicating whether or not person $i$ has watched movie $j$. In an applied setting—a recommender system, for instance—one may wish to compute a <em>truncated SVD </em>of this matrix. Here, only the top largest singular values are kept. The rest are viewed as containing little information and are set to zero. In this way, the diagonal matrix $D$&nbsp;operates on a low-dimensional "feature space," which provides a nice way to <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/basics">compress and glean information about the data</a>.</p><p>Either way, I like to think of $D$ as providing a bridge between two worlds: information about the columns of $U$ (e.g. people) and information about the columns of $V$ (e.g. movies). Below is a very <em>non</em>-mathematical cartoon of this. You can imagine the thickness of the blue bridge relates to the number of singular values. Lots of singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is wide and lots of information passes through. Only a few singular values?&nbsp;The bridge is narrow and not much information gets through.</p><figure id="w-node-fc7a2c3b2624-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f55643d546e4a903f261c30_bridge2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>An actual mathematical picture is found in a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-as-tensor-network-diagrams">tensor network diagram</a> representation of SVD.&nbsp;There, $D$&nbsp;really is a bridge! As a visual cue, we might draw the edges adjacent to the blue node as very thick if the number of singular values is large, and draw them to be thin otherwise. This again represents the idea of information "flowing" between systems described by $U$ and $V$.</p><figure id="w-node-235ea1f864dc-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5564d7d7916c43e6f8c4ce_TN2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Alternatively still, if you enjoy thinking of <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs">matrices as bipartite graphs</a>, then you might have in mind the graphs below. If we have lots of blue nodes—i.e. lots of singular values—then there are lots of pathways between the pink and green nodes (i.e. people and movies). But if we have only a <em>few</em> blue nodes—i.e. a few singular values—then there are fewer pathways between pink and green.</p><figure id="w-node-9ef538caa942-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f577be8bc99498290bfcb81_graph2.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Either way we wish to visualize it, the role of the singular values—that is, the role of the diagonal matrix $D$—is key. Intuitively, they indicate the amount of "interaction" between the information stored by $U$ and $V$, and they mediate how those interactions contribute to the information represented by the original matrix $M$.</p><p><em>And this precisely idea behind the mathematics of entanglement</em>.</p><p>In the context of physics, one simply applies SVD to a particular matrix and then looks at the number of nonzero singular values of that matrix. This is the main idea behind something called the <em>Schmidt rank</em> of a quantum state (explained below), which is an integer that indicates how much entanglement is present. </p><blockquote>Entanglement is measured by the number of nonsingular values of a particular matrix. </blockquote><p>So what makes a physicist's application of SVD different from that of, say, someone building a movie recommender system?&nbsp;Well, in physics, your matrix $M$ presumably encodes information about a physical system and takes spatial considerations into account (ex. particles in a lattice). Its entries may also contain complex numbers, and the sum of their squares should satisfy $\sum_{ij}|M_{ij}|^2=1$. In this case—as I'll explain below—$M$ represents a <strong>quantum state</strong>. But lingo aside, the template is much the same: singular values convey important information about how two things—whether users and movies, or two quantum subsystems—are related.</p><p>I could stop here, but I'd like to dig a little deeper. In the next section, let me restate this punchline using slightly more specialized language.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Singular Values vs. Schmidt&nbsp;Rank</h2><p>To start, let's back up a bit. In a discussion of physics, what exactly is the matrix to which we apply SVD?&nbsp;In the opening example, we applied SVD to a user-by-movie matrix. But what's going on now?</p><p>Rather than starting with a matrix, we instead start with a <em>unit vector</em>. To that end, suppose $\psi$ is any unit vector in a <strong>tensor product</strong> of vector spaces $\mathbb{C}^n\otimes\mathbb{C}^m$. Here, it's important that our discussion takes place in a tensor product. After all, entanglement is defined <em>between two things</em> (So, if someone were to ask you, "How much entanglement is there?" one proper response would be, "Entanglement <em>between</em> <em>what</em>?"), and in quantum mechanics, the tensor product is the mathematical operation used to combine two systems. Now, if the phrase "tensor product" is unfamiliar to you, I recommend the article "<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-tensor-product-demystified">The Tensor Product, Demystified</a>." I&nbsp;think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how easy the concept is!</p><p>Alright, now that we have the vector $\psi$, it's easy to get a linear map $\mathbb{C}^m\to\mathbb{C}^n$ from it. Simply reshape the entries of $\psi$ into an $n\times m$ matrix $M$. (Said more formally, look at $\psi$&nbsp;under the isomorphism $A\otimes B^*\cong\text{hom}(B,A)$ for finite-dimensional vector spaces $A$&nbsp;and $B$.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f5517185b36106928a313a9_reshape.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the language of physics, $\psi$ is called a <strong>quantum state</strong>, and $M$&nbsp;is simply the matrix associated with it. More generally, the terms&nbsp;"unit vector" and "quantum state" are synonymous. That's because the squares of the entries of any unit vector define a probability distribution, and—in the context of physics—that probability distribution tells you about the <em>state</em> of the system you're studying. (This is the Born rule.)</p><p>But I&nbsp;digress. Let's get back to SVD.</p><p>Suppose the singular value decomposition of our matrix $M$ is given by $UDV^\dagger$. Here I'm using the dagger to denote the conjugate transpose of $V$ since we're allowing $M$ to have complex entries. Now I'd like to use this decomposition&nbsp;to rewrite $M$ in a slightly messier way. Let $\mathbf{u}_i$ and $\mathbf{v}_i$ denote the $i$th columns of $U$ and $V$, respectively, and let $d_i$ denote the $i$th singular value of $M$. Then we can expand the matrix $M$ as the following sum, where $k$&nbsp;is the rank of $M$. </p><figure id="w-node-dc0fefa9bd0b-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556da578cb1b3bbc952fdd_expand2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>We're almost at the punchline, but let me first introduce a definition and then make one final cosmetic change.</p><p>For any two vectors $\mathbf{u}$&nbsp;and $\mathbf{v}$, the matrix $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$ is called their <strong>outer product</strong>. This simple operation is also denoted with a tensor product symbol $\mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$ or in physicists' bra-ket notation by $|u\rangle\langle v|$. So for example, if $\mathbf{u}=\begin{bmatrix}1&amp;2&amp;3\end{bmatrix}^\top$ and $\mathbf{v}=\begin{bmatrix}4&amp;5\end{bmatrix}^\top$, then their outer product is the following little matrix.</p><figure id="w-node-c2af2f15f3fb-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f551c63f2d18fc4ccbcb28b_outer.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Why introduce this?&nbsp;Let's think back that expansion of $M$&nbsp;above. Under the correspondence $\mathbf{uv}^\dagger \leftrightarrow \mathbf{u}\otimes \mathbf{v}$, we can write $\psi$&nbsp;explicitly using the columns of $U$ and $V$, weighted by the singular values of $M$ like this:</p><figure id="w-node-3ff996165bf0-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556f9788b112261c051ef6_decomp0.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>At this point, you might think we haven't done much (and we haven't, really), <em>and yet</em> familiar things are now given <em>new names</em>. In the context of physics, the above decomposition of $\psi$ is called its <strong>Schmidt decomposition</strong>. The integer $k$, which is the rank of the original matrix $M$, is called its <strong>Schmidt rank</strong>. And the singular values $d_1,d_2,\ldots, d_k$ are called its <strong>Schmidt coefficients.</strong></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f556fb589f1f866fb28a990_decomp1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Although terminology is new, the ingredients aren't. And that's the punchline.</p><blockquote>Punchline: the quantum state $\psi$ is said to be <strong>entangled</strong> if its Schmidt rank&nbsp;(i.e. number of singular values) is strictly greater than 1, and is <strong>not entangled</strong> otherwise.</blockquote><p>So, do you see the connection with our discussion above? As we stressed earlier, singular values can be thought of as providing a "bridge" between two subsystems. They are a measure of how much interaction exists between them. In the context of physics, this interaction is understood as entanglement.</p><p>The upshot is that a large number of singular values—i.e. a high Schmidt rank or a "wide bridge"—corresponds to lots of communication between two subsystems. A small number of singular values—i.e. a low Schmidt rank or a "narrow bridge"—corresponds to little communication. At the lowest extreme, <em>one</em> singular value corresponds to <em>zero</em> entanglement, and we might as well omit the thin bridge in the image below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5f559310bc99491aa62d994a_zero1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Indeed, notice that if the Schmidt rank of $\psi$ is equal to <em>one</em>—that is, if $M$&nbsp;is a rank one matrix $M=\mathbf{uv}^\dagger$—then we can write $\psi=\mathbf{u\otimes v}$. In the mathematics literature, vectors of this form (i.e. a tensor product of vectors) are sometimes called <strong>simple tensors</strong>.&nbsp;For this reason, some mathematicians associate entanglement with "linear combinations of …</p></div></div>

September 7, 2020 | http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tl;dr: If you follow this blog you’ve seen me experiment with iframe-based citations; this post is about open-sourcing that tooling. <a href="#tutorial-start" target="_self">Skip</a> to demo, implementation tutorial, and GitHub link.</p>

<hr>

<p>Knowledge tooling is happily becoming a hot topic again. With this trend is coming revived interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Xanadu</a>, bi-directional hyperlinking, knowledge databases, visualizing knowledge graphs, and so on. At this moment, I see most of the emphasis being put on tooling for the research side, with Notion, Workflowy, and the new and hyped Roam Research leading the way.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/xanadu-shot.png" alt="Screenshot of the OpenXanadu prototpye"></p>

<p>Where I see less focus is the <em>writing</em> part of the knowledge production process, where older apps like Scrivener are still the thing to beat. And almost nobody at all is working on the reader’s experience. As a blogger who largely caters to a wide audience, I’m especially interested in these areas.</p>

<p>Written information is largely still presented as a single document, and writing tools are geared toward the production of long pages. But before I say what’s wrong with this, let me sing the praises of documents for a moment.</p>

<p>People often get carried away when they discover the original vision of hypertext, which involves a network of documents, portions of which are “transcluded” (included via hypertext) into one another. The implication is that readers could follow any reference and see the source material—and granted, this would be transformative. However, there’s a limit to the effectiveness of the knowledge network as a reading experience. “Hypertext books,” online books which are made up of an abundance of interlinked HTML pages, are mostly unpopular. The failure of this experiment is, in my opinion, very revealing.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/sprawlingplaces-shot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of tinderbox map of hypertext book Sprawling Places by David Kolb">
<span>Tinderbox map of a portion of David Kolb’s hypertext book Sprawling Places</span></p>

<p>Knowledge is not an accumulation of facts, nor is it even a set of facts and their relations. Facts are only rendered meaningful within narratives, and the single-page document is a format very conducive to narrative structure. The hypertext books that have gained popularity (I’m thinking here of <a href="http://meaningness.com/">Meaningness.com</a>) have largely conformed to this in two ways: 1) there is an intended reading order, and 2) the longer essays within the project do most of the heavy lifting in terms of imparting the author’s perspective to readers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the notion of the “document” that is intrinsic to web development today is overdetermined by the legacy of print media. The web document is a static, <em>finished</em> artifact that does not bring in dynamic data. This is strange because it lives on a medium that is alive, networked, and dynamic, a medium which we increasingly understand more as a <em>space</em> than a thing.</p>

<p>For example, consider how silly it is to include MLA-style citations at the bottom of a text when we have the vast capabilities of linked documents on the web. Why should the reader have to read every citation or trust that an author is not taking a citation out of context, when hyperlinks are available?</p>

<p>This all suggests that a compromise must be struck between the coherence of a text and the new opportunities for knowledge work afforded by the fundamental capabilities of the medium: the internet’s connectivity, the screen’s frame rate.</p>

<hr>

<p>My own blogging is one context in which I’ve seen this tension play out, and have been working to explore ways of making my texts richer. A lot of the ideas I talk about in various pieces of writing are connected to one another. When I publish an essay, I’m not done with it. The ideas live on and get renewed, reused, and recycled in later works. Some sentences contain definitions that are core to my mental models, and there are whole paragraphs that might be useful out of context. I’m building my knowledge network in mind maps and behind various SaaS APIs, but how can I publicly show my thinking to be part a cohesive worldview?</p>

<p>Normally people solve this by simply block quoting themselves, but this is a waste of an opportunity. The indented block quote is a print medium invention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_quotation#Origins">almost as old as typesetting</a>. The block quote is <em>plaintext</em>, it is not actually linked to the original text or its context.</p>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with one idea for a solution, and if you’ve read the last couple blog posts you’ll have seen it there. My stab at an answer is an iframe which shows the quote within its original context and gives a hint at its surroundings. Effectively, it’s a transclusion within my own blog. I’m currently satisfied with what I have as a v1, and am interested to see if others find it useful, so I’m open sourcing it here and including a tutorial.</p>



<p>Open Transclude is a UX pattern, a spec for networked writing within your own blog. Here’s how it looks:</p>



<!-- <script src="/portal.js"></script> -->



<p>What you are looking at is an scroll-locked iframe that links to a quote I picked out of my blog post “Notes on Comparative Psychology.” You can use Open Transclude anywhere you can drop an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag on your own site.</p>

<p>Open Transclude:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Works anywhere on your own domain</li>
  <li>Compatible with most static site generators / templating engines</li>
  <li>12 lines of HTML, 80 lines of SCSS, 22 lines of JS (4.5 kb total)</li>
  <li>Has 0 dependencies&nbsp;— this is native web technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Open Transclude is extremely simple, and the heaviest part of the code is the CSS, which you can simplify at your whim. That’s why I am referring to it as a UX pattern. This is not a protocol. The code is really a commodity. What’s interesting about it is the idea and the design, and this is just one viable implementation! Feel free to adapt it however you like.</p>

<p>The principal improvement over a block quotation is <em>sense of context</em>.</p>

<p>Over on GitHub you’ll find the <a href="https://github.com/tobyshorin/Open-Transclude/">reference implementation for Jekyll</a>. Below is a tutorial for implementing it yourself, by way of also explaining some of the technical design decisions.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="implementation-recipe">Implementation Recipe</h2>

<p>Here’s what you need to do to get Open Transclude up and running.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an anchor tag in the blog post where you want to cite yourself.</li>
  <li>Create the HTML for the reusable transclusion component.</li>
  <li>Call the portal into any document and passing it Jekyll variables.</li>
  <li>A small piece of Javascript which populates your transclusion into the document.</li>
  <li>Create the SCSS file with the component’s styles.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-create-the-anchor-tag-where-you-want-to-cite-yourself">1. <strong>Create the anchor tag where you want to cite yourself</strong></h3>

<p>To quote yourself, you’ll need to create an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor tag in the markdown file for the post you want to quote. If you wish to highlight a specific piece of text, instead create a <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> around the section you want to quote. Note that this can <em>only be on your own website</em>—it doesn’t work cross domain.</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like for the example iframe above.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="markdown">It will, for one thing, become newly conscious of itself, and, to the degree that it is, <span>**it will tend to undermine its own experiential integrity**</span>" (emphasis mine).

<span>&lt;span</span> <span>name=</span><span>"mainstream-magic"</span><span>&gt;</span>Ironically, psychology remains one of the closest things we have to a mainstream magic or a mystical art today. Not only is it plainly the direct descendent of medieval magic, as I learned when I read Ioan Coulianou's <span>*Eros and Magic in the Renaissance*</span> earlier this year. <span>**It is a theory of the self that is phenomenologically accurate, objectively wrong, and is based on magical thinking even as it deconstructs itself**</span>.<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span> Some magical thinking processes that happen in psychotherapy, such as <span>[</span><span>transference to the psychologist</span><span>](</span><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference#Transference_and_countertransference_during_psychotherapy</span><span>)</span>, are even intended to stay unmentioned to the patient in order to be utilized most effectively by the therapist!</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="2-create-your-iframe-component">2. Create your iframe component</h3>

<p>This is most useful as a standardized component which can be used across the site, so we are going to take advantage of Jekyll’s templating features. Jekyll and other static site generators like Kirby and Zola support HTML “partials” or “includes” so that you can create reusable components.</p>

<p>In your <code>/_scss</code> or <code>/_sass</code> folder make a new file, <code>portal.scss</code>. I called it “portal” because it’s shorter than “transclusion” and less prone to spelling errors.</p>

<p>Here’s our component:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-container"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-head"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-backlink"</span> <span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>From <span>&lt;span</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-text-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>{{ include.title }}<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"{{ include.link }}"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-arrow"</span><span>&gt;</span>Go to text <span>&lt;span</span> <span>class=</span><span>"right-arrow"</span><span>&gt;</span>→<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"portal-parent-{{include.anchor}}"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent-fader-top"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent-fader-bottom"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>        
        <span>&lt;!-- We'll use Javascript to populate the iframe right here --&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>    
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You’ll notice immediately that the iframe isn’t there yet. Like I mentioned above, we’re going to be populating it with Javascript.</p>

<p>You’ll also see that in various places we’re using <code>{{ include.___}}</code>. A cool thing about Jekyll includes its that it’s possible to define variables and pass them to our include, so we can create reusable components across our site. Dave Rupert has a <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/07/jekyll-includes-are-cool/">nice blog post about this</a> called if you want to see more advanced examples!</p>

<h3 id="3-calling-the-component">3. Calling the component</h3>

<p>Anytime you want to pull this component into a blog post, all you have to do is <code>include</code> it in the markdown of another blog post, like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">  {% include portal.html title="Notes On Comparative Psychology" link="/entries/notes-on-comparative-psychology/#mainstream-magic" anchor="emotional-deficit" %} </code></pre></figure>

<p>When you include it, you’ll need to pass in those three variables - title, link, and anchor, that fill in the includes above. If you’re following along now and making a build in Jekyll, you’ll see an empty, unstyled component with the link. So good so far!</p>

<h3 id="4-populating-with-javascript">4. Populating with Javascript</h3>

<p>This is a good time to address why we need Javascript. Web developers reading this are probably asking why we don’t simply put the full <code>/link#with-anchor</code> into the iframe src and be done with it. …</p></div></div>

<p>Tamara conducts research into the molecular structure that facilitates the efficient photosynthesis process in algae. A single algae has many protrusions on its surface, called antennae, which form vital components of its light harvesting system. “It’s a highly complex system. Each protrusion is made up of stacks of tiny disks. Inside each disk, there is a ‘gamma’ building block that passes the light efficiently into the system.”</p>
<h2>Different forms of a single molecule</h2>
<p>Tamara used mass spectrometry (MS) to discover that there may be up to 20 different types of gamma building blocks. “MS allows you to determine the weight of molecules. Each specific molecule has its own weight. The number of peaks in our mass spectrum then displays the number of different forms of a specific type of molecule.” So far, Tamara has accurately defined four different gamma building blocks. “And some of them can convert the light better than others.”</p></div></div><div><div><blockquote><p>The system is more complicated than a Swiss watch. This is the product of three billion years of evolution, and engineers could learn a lot from it.</p> </blockquote></div></div><div><div><h2>Efficient through diversity</h2>
<p>The wide diversity of molecules that let light through does not mean that one form of the light harvesting system is more efficient than another, however. According to Professor of Mass Spectrometry <a href="https://www.uu.nl/staff/AJRHeck">Albert Heck</a>, Tamara’s PhD supervisor: “I think that the diversity of gamma building blocks is what makes the system work optimally under all circumstances. It can constantly adapt, so it is much more refined than we earlier thought.”</p>
<h2>New generation of solar panels</h2>
<p>Heck hopes that today’s solar panels, which have a yield of 20 percent at most, may eventually be improved with help from the same system that algae use. “The ingenious control panel that algae use to convert sunlight into usable energy is more complicated than a Swiss watch. This is the product of three billion years of evolution, and engineers could learn a lot from it. A primal organism that gives us the blueprint for the ultimate super-efficient solar cells.”</p>

    <article>
        <h2 id="starting-at-the-beginning"><a href="https://github.com/pcorey/minimum_viable_phoenix/commit/6f8c9d84ea05d8dd4e137ae6133db4ad06fb6498">Starting at the Beginning</a></h2>

<p>Phoenix ships with quite a few bells and whistles. Whenever you fire up <code><span>mix</span> <span>phx</span><span>.</span><span>new</span></code> to create a new web application, forty six files are created and spread across thirty directories!</p>

<p>This can be overwhelming to developers new to Phoenix.</p>

<p>To build a better understanding of the framework and how all of its moving pieces interact, let’s strip Phoenix down to its bare bones. Let’s start from zero and slowly build up to a <strong>minimum viable Phoenix application</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-viable-elixir"><a href="https://github.com/pcorey/minimum_viable_phoenix/commit/4e2e319595415ff66fdc18679547ac49247979e7">Minimum Viable Elixir</a></h2>

<p>Starting at the beginning, we need to recognize that all Phoenix applications are Elixir applications. Our first step in the process of building a minimum viable Phoenix application is really to build a minimum viable Elixir application.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the simplest possible Elixir application is simply an <code><span>*.</span><span>ex</span></code> file that contains some source code. To set ourselves up for success later, let’s place our code in <code><span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>minimal</span><span>/</span><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>ex</span></code>. We’ll start by simply printing <code><span>"Hello."</span></code> to the console.</p>

<pre><code>
IO.puts("Hello.")
</code></pre>

<p>Surprisingly, we can execute our newly written Elixir application by compiling it:</p>

<pre><code>
➜ elixirc lib/minimal/application.ex
Hello.
</code></pre>

<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/petecorey/status/1122629600800989184">confused me at first</a>, but it was explained to me that in the Elixir world, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/41235949">compilation is also evaluation</a>.</p>

<p>lib/minimal/application.ex</p>
<pre><code>
+IO.puts("Hello.")
</code></pre>

<h2 id="generating-artifacts"><a href="https://github.com/pcorey/minimum_viable_phoenix/commit/f36703771756c1d149a58584e242c0e4d6ce607e">Generating Artifacts</a></h2>

<p>While our execution-by-compilation works, it’s really nothing more than an on-the-fly evaluation. We’re not generating any compilation artifacts that can be re-used later, or deployed elsewhere.</p>

<p>We can fix that by moving our code into a module. Once we compile our newly modularized <code><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>ex</span></code>, a new <code><span>Elixir</span><span>.</span><span>Minimal</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>beam</span></code> file will appear in the root of our project.</p>

<p>We can run our compiled Elixir program by running <code><span>elixir</span></code> in the directory that contains our <code><span>*.</span><span>beam</span></code> file and specifying an expression to evaluate using the <code><span>-</span><span>e</span></code> flag:</p>

<pre><code>
➜ elixir -e "Minimal.Application.start()"
Hello.
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, we could spin up an interactive shell (<code><span>iex</span></code>) in the same directory and evaluate the expression ourselves:</p>

<pre><code>
iex(1)&gt; Minimal.Application.start()
Hello.
</code></pre>

<p>.gitignore</p>
<pre><code>
+*.beam
.DS_Store
</code></pre>

<p>lib/minimal/application.ex</p>
<pre><code>
-IO.puts("Hello.")
+defmodule Minimal.Application do
+  def start do
+    IO.puts("Hello.")
+  end
+end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="incorporating-mix"><a href="https://github.com/pcorey/minimum_viable_phoenix/commit/7c2fcd8300e13f04dd0c20a9ae2153b9c21ecebe">Incorporating Mix</a></h2>

<p>This is great, but manually managing our <code><span>*.</span><span>beam</span></code> files and bootstrap expressions is a little cumbersome. Not to mention the fact that we haven’t even started working with dependencies yet.</p>

<p>Let’s make our lives easier by incorporating <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html">the Mix build tool</a> into our application development process.</p>

<p>We can do that by creating a <code><span>mix</span><span>.</span><span>exs</span></code> Elixir script file in the root of our project that defines a module that uses <code><span>Mix</span><span>.</span><span>Project</span></code> and describes our application. We write a <code><span>project</span><span>/</span><span>0</span></code> callback in our new <code><span>MixProject</span></code> module who’s only requirement is to return our application’s name (<code><span>:minimal</span></code>) and version (<code><span>"0.1.0"</span></code>).</p>

<pre><code>
def project do
  [
    app: :minimal,
    version: "0.1.0"
  ]
end
</code></pre>

<p>While Mix only requires that we return the <code><span>:app</span></code> and <code><span>:version</span></code> configuration values, it’s worth taking a look at the other configuration options available to us, especially <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.html"><code><span>:elixir</span></code> and <code><span>:start_permanent</span></code></a>, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Compile.html#module-configuration"><code><span>:build_path</span></code></a>, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Compile.Elixir.html#module-configuration"><code><span>:elixirc_paths</span></code></a>, and others.</p>

<p>Next, we need to specify an <code><span>application</span><span>/</span><span>0</span></code> callback in our <code><span>MixProject</span></code> module that tells Mix which module we want to run when our application fires up.</p>

<pre><code>
def application do
  [
    mod: {Minimal.Application, []}
  ]
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here we’re pointing it to the <code><span>Minimal</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span></code> module we wrote previously.</p>

<p>During the normal application startup process, Elixir will call the <code><span>start</span><span>/</span><span>2</span></code> function of the module we specify with <code><span>:normal</span></code> as the first argument, and whatever we specify (<code><span>[]</span></code> in this case) as the second. With that in mind, let’s modify our <code><span>Minimal</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>/</span><span>2</span></code> function to accept those parameters:</p>

<pre><code>
def start(:normal, []) do
  IO.puts("Hello.")
  {:ok, self()}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we also changed the return value of <code><span>start</span><span>/</span><span>2</span></code> to be an <code><span>:ok</span></code> tuple whose second value is a PID. Normally, an application would spin up a supervisor process as its first act of life and return its PID. We’re not doing that yet, so we simply return the current process’ PID.</p>

<p>Once these changes are done, we can run our application with <code><span>mix</span></code> or <code><span>mix</span> <span>run</span></code>, or fire up an interactive Elixir shell with <code><span>iex</span> <span>-</span><span>S</span> <span>mix</span></code>. No bootstrap expression required!</p>

<p>.gitignore</p>
<pre><code>
 *.beam
-.DS_Store
+.DS_Store
+/_build/
</code></pre>

<p>lib/minimal/application.ex</p>
<pre><code>
 defmodule Minimal.Application do
-  def start do
+  def start(:normal, []) do
     IO.puts("Hello.")
+    {:ok, self()}
   end
</code></pre>

<p>mix.exs</p>
<pre><code>
+defmodule Minimal.MixProject do
+  use Mix.Project
+
+  def project do
+    [
+      app: :minimal,
+      version: "0.1.0"
+    ]
+  end
+
+  def application do
+    [
+      mod: {Minimal.Application, []}
+    ]
+  end
+end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="pulling-in-dependencies"><a href="https://github.com/pcorey/minimum_viable_phoenix/commit/b5dd4d3ffeea0cc136004e762576b873a6ca1d4d">Pulling in Dependencies</a></h2>

<p>Now that we’ve built a minimum viable Elixir project, let’s turn our attention to the Phoenix framework. The first thing we need to do to incorporate Phoenix into our Elixir project is to install a few dependencies.</p>

<p>We’ll start by adding a <code><span>deps</span></code> array to the <code><span>project</span><span>/</span><span>0</span></code> callback in our <code><span>mix</span><span>.</span><span>exs</span></code> file. In <code><span>deps</span></code> we’ll list <code><span>:phoenix</span></code>, <code><span>:plug_cowboy</span></code>, and <code><span>:jason</span></code> as dependencies.</p>

<p>By default, Mix stores downloaded dependencies in the <code><span>deps</span><span>/</span></code> folder at the root of our project. Let’s be sure to add that folder to our <code><span>.</span><span>gitignore</span></code>. Once we’ve done that, we can install our dependencies with <code><span>mix</span> <span>deps</span><span>.</span><span>get</span></code>.</p>

<p>The reliance on <code><span>:phoenix</span></code> makes sense, but why are we already pulling in <code><span>:plug_cowboy</span></code> and <code><span>:jason</span></code>?</p>

<p>Under the hood, Phoenix uses the <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy</a> web server, and <a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug">Plug</a> to compose functionality on top of our web server. It would make sense that Phoenix relies on <code><span>:plug_cowboy</span></code> to bring these two components into our application. If we try to go on with building our application without installing <code><span>:plug_cowboy</span></code>, we’ll be greeted with the following errors:</p>

<pre><code>** (UndefinedFunctionError) function Plug.Cowboy.child_spec/1 is undefined (module Plug.Cowboy is not available)
    Plug.Cowboy.child_spec([scheme: :http, plug: {MinimalWeb.Endpoint, []}
    ...</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, Phoenix relies on a JSON serialization library to be installed and configured. Without either <code><span>:jason</span></code> or <code><span>:poison</span></code> installed, we’d receive the following warning when trying to run our application:</p>

<pre><code>warning: failed to load Jason for Phoenix JSON encoding
(module Jason is not available).

Ensure Jason exists in your deps in mix.exs,
and you have configured Phoenix to use it for JSON encoding by
verifying the following exists in your config/config.exs:

config :phoenix, :json_library, Jason</code></pre>

<p>Heeding that advice, we’ll install <code><span>:jason</span></code> and add that configuration line to a new file in our project, <code><span>config</span><span>/</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>exs</span></code>.</p>

<p>.gitignore</p>
<pre><code>
 /_build/
+/deps/
</code></pre>

<p>config/config.exs</p>
<pre><code>
+use Mix.Config
+
+config :phoenix, :json_library, Jason
</code></pre>

<p>mix.exs</p>
<pre><code>
   app: :minimal,
-  version: "0.1.0"
+  version: "0.1.0",
+  deps: [
+    {:jason, "~&gt; 1.0"},
+    {:phoenix, "~&gt; 1.4"},
+    {:plug_cowboy, "~&gt; 2.0"}
+  ]
 ]
 </code></pre>

<h2 id="introducing-the-endpoint"><a href="https://github.com/pcorey/minimum_viable_phoenix/commit/6e654aa2b5ea693e3cd28fbb4cfd46049a6cf852">Introducing the Endpoint</a></h2>

<p>Now that we’ve installed our dependencies on the Phoenix framework and the web server it uses under the hood, it’s time to define how that web server incorporates into our application.</p>

<p>We do this by defining an “endpoint”, which is our application’s interface into the underlying HTTP web server, and our clients’ interface into our web application.</p>

<p>Following Phoenix conventions, we define our endpoint by creating a <code><span>MinimalWeb</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span></code> module that uses <code><span>Phoenix</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span></code> and specifies the <code><span>:name</span></code> of our OTP application (<code><span>:minimal</span></code>):</p>

<pre><code>
defmodule MinimalWeb.Endpoint do
  use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :minimal
end

If you’re curious about how Phoenix works at a low level, start your search here.</p>

<p><code><span>Phoenix</span><span>.</span><span>Endpoint</span></code> uses the value we provide in <code><span>:otp_app</span></code> to look up configuration values for our application. Phoenix will complain if we don’t provide a bare minimum configuration entry for our endpoint, so we’ll add that to our <code><span>config</span><span>/</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>exs</span></code> file:</p>

<pre><code>
config :minimal, MinimalWeb.Endpoint, []
</code></pre>

<p>But there are a few configuration values we want to pass to our endpoint, like the host and port we want to serve from. These values are usually environment-dependent, so we’ll add a line at the bottom of our <code><span>config</span><span>/</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>exs</span></code> to load another configuration file based on our current environment:</p>

<pre><code>
import_config "#{Mix.env()}.exs"
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we’ll create a new <code><span>config</span><span>/</span><span>dev</span><span>.</span><span>exs</span></code> file that specifies the <code><span>:host</span></code> and <code><span>:port</span></code> we’ll serve from during development:</p>

<pre><code>
use Mix.Config
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
config :minimal, MinimalWeb.Endpoint,
  url: [host: "localhost"],
  http: [port: 4000]
</code></pre>

<p>If we were to start our application at this point, we’d still be greeted with <code><span>Hello</span><span>.</span></code> printed to the console, rather than a running Phoenix server. We still need to incorporate our Phoenix endpoint into our application.</p>

<p>We do this by turning our <code><span>Minimal</span><span>.</span><span>Application</span></code> into a proper supervisor and instructing it to load our endpoint as a supervised child:</p>

<pre><code>
use Application
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
def start(:normal, []) do
  Supervisor.start_link(
    [
      MinimalWeb.Endpoint
    ],
    strategy: :one_for_one
  )
end
</code></pre>

<p>Once we’ve done that, we can fire up our application using <code><span>mix</span> <span>phx</span><span>.</span><span>server</span></code> or <code><span>iex</span> <span>-</span><span>S</span> <span>mix</span> <span>phx</span><span>.</span><span>server</span></code> and see that our endpoint is listening on <code><span>localhost</span></code> port <code><span>4000</span></code>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you want to use our old standby of <code><span>mix</span> <span>run</span></code>, either configure Phoenix to serve all endpoints on startup, <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/858f1ea439e8cef3cb1206812fc41db7199ba884/lib/mix/tasks/phx.server.ex#L31">which is what <code><span>mix</span> <span>phx</span><span>.</span><span>server</span></code> does under the hood</a>:</p>

<pre><code>
config :phoenix, :serve_endpoints, true
</code></pre>

<p>Or configure your application’s endpoint specifically:</p>

<pre><code>
config :minimal, MinimalWeb.Endpoint, server: true
</code></pre>

<p>config/config.exs</p>
<pre><code>
+config :minimal, MinimalWeb.Endpoint, []

 config :phoenix, :json_library, Jason

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Doom Eternal is the successor of Doom 2016. It’s developed using the 7th iteration of id Tech, id Software’s in-house game engine. Doom 2016 has inspired me greatly on a technologic level due to its simplicity and elegance while still having a high visual quality. For Doom Eternal, this is no different. Doom Eternal has improved in many areas of which a few are worth investigating which I will try to cover in this frame breakdown.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This frame breakdown is inspired by <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2016/09/09/doom-2016-graphics-study/">Adrian Courreges’s study on Doom 2016</a>. I believe these graphics studies give a lot of insight into how certain rendering problems are solved in a AAA game and are greatly educational. In this breakdown I aim to stay at a high level and not go too in-depth of each rendering technique/pass. Some passes might not be covered here because they are very similar to Doom 2016 and are well covered in Adrian Courreges’s study.</p>

<p>I do want to stress here that these studies are absolutely nothing more than <strong>educational</strong>. I do not in any way support the reverse engineering for malicious purposes and stealing intellectual property. If you haven’t played the game yet, don’t worry about spoilers! The section I used for this study is in the beginning of the game which doesn’t give away any of the details.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get down to business.</p>

<p>With Id Tech 7, the engine has moved away from OpenGL and is entirely built with a <strong>Vulkan</strong> backend allowing them to make better use of current generation GPU features, bindless resources in particular.</p>

<hr>



<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We’re looking at a section in the game close to the start. It’s an interior with a few enemies and a large portion of volumetric lighting. Just like its predecessor, Doom Eternal is using a <strong>forward rendering</strong> pipeline. Doom 2016 was mostly forward rendered with a thin G-Buffer for screen space reflections. However this time, everything is fully forward rendered omitting the G-Buffer.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="step-away-from-mega-texture">Step away from Mega-Texture</h2>

<p>With id Tech 5 used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_(video_game)">Rage</a>, there was a texture streaming concept introduced called ‘Mega-Texture’ which was also used in the previous Doom installment. This system works by rendering a so called ‘feedback texture’ each frame that contains the information of what texture data was visible, that texture is analysed next frame to determine which textures get streamed in from disk. This has an obvious flaw because once a texture is on screen, it’s basically already too late to load it and this causes blurry textures the first few frames it is on screen. In id Tech 7, id Software has stepped away from this approach.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="gpu-skinning">GPU Skinning</h2>

<p>The first thing that happens even before anything gets drawn to a texture, is evaluating skinning. This is commonly done in a vertex shader before shading. An alternative approach used here, is to do skinning beforehand in a compute shader which writes out skinned vertices to a buffer. This has a couple of advantages mainly not having to do skinning in the vertex shader for every geometry pass. This results in having less shader permutations because the vertex shader doesn’t have to know about skinning.</p>

<p>Skinning in a compute shader is not much different from in a vertex shader except that the output gets written to an intermediate buffer which can then be consumed in a vertex shader that can treat it as a regular static mesh. Just like in a vertex shader, for each vertex, a compute shader thread retrieves the transform of each bone affecting the vertex, transforms its position with each bone transform and adds up these positions based on the skin weights stored on the vertex.</p>

<p>János Turánszki wrote a wonderful write-up of how it can be implemented using a compute shader:
<a href="https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/">https://wickedengine.net/2017/09/09/skinning-in-compute-shader/</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing that is worth noting here is the use of <strong>Alembic Caches</strong> in Doom Eternal. These caches contain baked animation which get streamed and decompressed at runtime. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsmqWSZpgJY">Digital Foundry described in their tech breakdown</a>, this is used for a wide range of animations going from large cinematic pieces to small tentacles on the floor. This is especially useful for animations that are hard to achieve using skinned animation like organics and cloth simulation. You can compare an Alembic Cache with a video that can be played back and is highly compressed by looking ahead. I suggest watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlz-7V_XiUA">Axel Gneiting’s talk at Siggraph 2014</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="shadow-mapping">Shadow Mapping</h2>

<p>Next up is shadow rendering. There doesn’t seem to be any large changes in how shadow maps are approached in id Tech 7 compared to its predecessor.</p>

<p>As seen below, shadows get rendered in a large 4096x8196px 24-bit depth texture which may vary across quality levels. The texture is persistent across frames and as described in “Devil is in the Details” at Siggraph 2016, the static geometry in the shadow map is cached to save having to redraw the shadow maps each frame. The technique is fairly simple: as long as nothing in the view of the light moves, there is no need to update the shadows. If a dynamic object in the frustum moves, a ‘cached’ shadow map is copied into the actual shadow map and the dynamic geometry is re-drawn on top. This cached shadow map is the same shadow map but only with static geometry because you can make the assumption that these will never change. This saves having to draw the entire scene in the frustum every time it needs to update. Of course, when the light moves, the entire scene has to be redrawn from scratch.</p>

<p>When sampling the shadow map during lighting, a 3x3 PCF sampling approach is used to smoothen the shadow edges. For the sun light, <strong>cascaded shadow maps</strong> are used to distribute the quality better as it covers such a large portion of the environment.</p>

<p>Here is a closer look at the shadow atlas. A light with higher importance, larger screen area or that is closer to the camera, will get a larger portion of the atlas assigned for better resolution. These heuristics are evaluated dynamically.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image3.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="depth-pre-pass-and-velocity">Depth Pre-pass and Velocity</h2>

<p>Opaque geometry gets rendered to a depth-only target starting with the player’s gun, then static geometry, and finally dynamic geometry. A depth pre-pass is common to avoid unnecessary pixel shader calculations later down the pipeline where geometry overlaps. A depth pre-pass is especially important in a forward renderer where redundant pixel calculations are extremely wasteful due to pixel overdraw. With a depth pre-pass, the actual forward lighting pixel shader can reject pixels by comparing with the depth buffer before execution, saving a lot of performance.</p>

    <li data-target="#prepassCarousel" data-slide-to="0"></li>
    <li data-target="#prepassCarousel" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#prepassCarousel" data-slide-to="2"></li>
  </ol>
  <div>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/Prepass0.png"></p><p>First person gun</p>
    </div>

      <p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/Prepass1.png"></p><p>Static objects</p>

  </a>
  <a href="#prepassCarousel" role="button" data-slide="next">
    
    <span>Next</span>
  </a>
</p></div>

<p>Besides rendering depth, the pre-pass also renders to another color target. For dynamic geometry, the velocity is rendered using motion vectors which is the position of the current position subtracted from the position of the pixel in the previous frame. We only need the motion on the X and Y axis so the motion is stored in the red and green channel of a 16-bit floating point render target. This information is later used in post processing for applying motion blur and reprojection for temporal anti-aliasing. The image below is exaggerated because this snapshot doesn’t have a lot of motion. Static geometry does not need motion vectors as their motion can be derived from the camera motion because they have only “moved” relative to the camera.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image6.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="hierarchical-z-depth">Hierarchical-Z Depth</h2>

<p>Next up, a hierarchical mip chain of the depth buffer is generated which is similar to a mip map but instead of averaging 4 neighboring pixels, the maximum is taken. This is commonly done in graphics for various purposes like accelerating screen space reflections and occlusion culling. In this case, this mip chain is used to accelerate the light and decal culling which is covered later. More recently, mip generation is done in a single pass by writing into multiple mips at once. In Doom Eternal, it still traditionally does a dispatch for every mip separately.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.simoncoenen.com/images/blog/010_doom_eternal_study/image7.gif" alt=""></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mesh-decals">Mesh Decals</h2>

<p>Up until what I’ve covered so far, there haven’t been many noticeable changes compared to Doom 2016. However, “mesh decals” is an addition to the mesh rendering pipeline introduced in Doom Eternal. Unlike the common decal workflow - which are placed freely in the environment - a mesh decal is placed during the mesh authoring pipeline by artists and so belong to the mesh. Before, Doom heavily relied on decals and stepped it up with the addition of so called “mesh decals” in this game for even better detailing and flexibility. “Mesh decals” are small decals like bolts, grills, bumps, stickers, … Just like a traditional decal, it can modify any property of the underlying surface like the normal, roughness, base color, …</p>

<p>To achieve this, the following geometry pass renders each of the decals’s ID into an 8-bit render target. Later during shading, this texture is sampled to retrieve the ID which is used to retrieve a projection matrix bound with each draw call. The matrix projects the pixel’s position from world space into texture space. These coordinates are then used to sample the decal and blend with the underlying material. This is extremely fast and allows artists to go crazy with massive amounts of decals. Because the IDs are rendered to an 8-bit texture, the maximum amount of decals per mesh would theoretically be 255.</p>

<p>One requirement for this, is that all decals are bound to the pipeline when drawing meshes. Doom Eternal uses a fully bindless render pipeline which allows them to bind all decal textures at once and dynamically index them in the shader. More on this bindless pipeline later as this is important to pull off other tricks they’ve done in this game.</p>

<p>Below, the mesh decal texture. The different IDs are coloured to visualize it better.</p>

As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsmqWSZpgJY">Digital Foundry described in their tech breakdown</a>, this is used for a wide range of animations going from large cinematic pieces to small tentacles on the floor. This is especially useful for animations that are hard to achieve using skinned animation like organics and cloth simulation. You can compare an Alembic Cache with a video that can be played back and is highly compressed by looking ahead. I suggest watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlz-7V_XiUA">Axel Gneiting’s talk at Siggraph 2014</a> if you’re interested in learning more.</p>

<h2 id="shadow-mapping">Shadow Mapping</h2>

<p>Next up is shadow rendering. There doesn’t seem to be any large changes in how shadow maps are approached in id Tech 7 compared to its predecessor.</p>

<p>As seen below, shadows get rendered in a large 4096x8196px 24-bit depth texture which may vary across quality levels. The texture is persistent across frames and as described in “Devil is in the Details” at Siggraph 2016, the static geometry in the shadow map is cached to save having to redraw the shadow maps each frame. The technique is fairly simple: as long as nothing in the view of the light moves, there is no need to update the shadows. If a dynamic object in the frustum moves, a ‘cached’ shadow map is copied into the actual shadow map and the dynamic geometry is re-drawn on top. This cached shadow map is the same shadow map but only with static geometry because you can make the assumption that these will never change. This saves having to draw the entire scene in the frustum every time it needs to update. Of course, when the light moves, the entire scene has to be redrawn from scratch.</p>

<p>When sampling the shadow map during lighting, a 3x3 PCF sampling approach is used to smoothen the shadow edges. For the sun light, <strong>cascaded shadow maps</strong> are used to distribute the quality better as it covers such a large portion of the environment.</p>

<p>Here is a closer look at the shadow atlas. A light with higher importance, larger screen area or that is closer to the camera, will get a larger portion of the atlas assigned for better resolution. These heuristics are evaluated dynamically.</p>

<h2 id="depth-pre-pass-and-velocity">Depth Pre-pass and Velocity</h2>

<p>Opaque geometry gets rendered to a depth-only target starting with the player’s gun, then static geometry, and finally dynamic geometry. A depth pre-pass is common to avoid unnecessary pixel shader calculations later down the pipeline where geometry overlaps. A depth pre-pass is especially important in a forward renderer where redundant pixel calculations are extremely wasteful due to pixel overdraw. With a depth pre-pass, the actual forward lighting pixel shader can reject pixels by comparing with the depth buffer before execution, saving a lot of performance.</p>

</p></div>

<p>Besides rendering depth, the pre-pass also renders to another color target. For dynamic geometry, the velocity is rendered using motion vectors which is the position of the current position subtracted from the position of the pixel in the previous frame. We only need the motion on the X and Y axis so the motion is stored in the red and green channel of a 16-bit floating point render target. This information is later used in post processing for applying motion blur and reprojection for temporal anti-aliasing. The image below is exaggerated because this snapshot doesn’t have a lot of motion. Static geometry does not need motion vectors as their motion can be derived from the camera motion because they have only “moved” relative to the camera.</p>

<h2 id="hierarchical-z-depth">Hierarchical-Z Depth</h2>

<p>Next up, a hierarchical mip chain of the depth buffer is generated which is similar to a mip map but instead of averaging 4 neighboring pixels, the maximum is taken. This is commonly done in graphics for various purposes like accelerating screen space reflections and occlusion culling. In this case, this mip chain is used to accelerate the light and decal culling which is covered later. More recently, mip generation is done in a single pass by writing into multiple mips at once. In Doom Eternal, it still traditionally does a dispatch for every mip separately.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="mesh-decals">Mesh Decals</h2>

<p>Up until what I’ve covered so far, there haven’t been many noticeable changes compared to Doom 2016. However, “mesh decals” is an addition to the mesh rendering pipeline introduced in Doom Eternal. Unlike the common decal workflow - which are placed freely in the environment - a mesh decal is placed during the mesh authoring pipeline by artists and so belong to the mesh. Before, Doom heavily relied on decals and stepped it up with the addition of so called “mesh decals” in this game for even better detailing and flexibility. “Mesh decals” are small decals like bolts, grills, bumps, stickers, … Just like a traditional decal, it can modify any property of the underlying surface like the normal, roughness, base color, …</p>

<p>To achieve this, the following geometry pass renders each of the decals’s ID into an 8-bit render target. Later during shading, this texture is sampled to retrieve the ID which is used to retrieve a projection matrix bound with each draw call. The matrix projects the pixel’s position from world space into texture space. These coordinates are then used to sample the decal and blend with the underlying material. This is extremely fast and allows artists to go crazy with massive amounts of decals. Because the IDs are rendered to an 8-bit texture, the maximum amount of decals per mesh would theoretically be 255.</p>

<p>One requirement for this, is that all decals are bound to the pipeline when drawing meshes. Doom Eternal uses a fully bindless render pipeline which allows them to bind all decal textures at once and dynamically index them in the shader. More on this bindless pipeline later as this is important to pull off other tricks they’ve done in this game.</p>

<p>Below, the mesh decal texture. The different IDs are coloured to visualize it better.</p>

<p>The second time he tried DMT, Ali <em>broke through</em>. (His name isn’t actually Ali, but that’s what we’ll call him for privacy’s sake.) The initial onslaught of kaleidoscopic shapes gave way to a more familiar scene: The bedroom, twin mattress and all, from which he embarked on his DMT experience. Only, the room’s features weren’t quite right. They were distorted somehow, like an unfinished rendering—and he had company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five silvery beings surrounded him, he describes, their towering, slender bodies cloaked in what can only be described as alien skin (or maybe just gray spandex). But their imposing nature wasn’t the most unusual thing about them; it was their faces. Their faces matched Ali’s friends, who had already been in the room before his DMT experience began.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>And yet, these entities <em>weren’t</em> just his friends; they were distinctly different. Their faces were jumbled, abstracted, and leaking colored light. Ali had the uncanny sense that these beings were of their own world entirely.</p><p>Ali had journeyed into the spirit world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>




<h2><span id="What_Are_Clockwork_Elves_Machine_Elves">What Are Clockwork Elves (Machine Elves)?</span></h2>



<p>Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a powerful and fast-acting hallucinogen produced naturally by many plants and animals, humans included. (Yes, DMT is found in the <a href="https://www.psypost.org/2019/07/study-provides-evidence-that-dmt-is-produced-naturally-from-neurons-in-the-mammalian-brain-54051">mammalian brain</a>.)&nbsp; In all of 15 minutes, the molecule can inspire a bombardment of visuals that begin with a snow of overwhelming shapes and colors and peaks—if you’re lucky—with an entry into another realm, a step into what feels like a different world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was such sensory overload, it was so dense, that even if I describe it, it doesn’t really give any indication of what [the experience] was actually like,” says Ali. “It felt like [time was] completely arbitrary, kinda scary like maybe you could live like a year in there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a reason why DMT has well-earned its nickname as “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/DMT-Molecule-Revolutionary-Near-Death-Experiences/dp/0892819278">the spirit molecule</a>.” For some, the molecule may only inspire intense and awesome visuals. But, many who try DMT do so looking for something, or rather, someone specific—the spirits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeing DMT entities or experiencing some kind of “presence” is a common experience for those who cross a certain dosage threshold with this unusual drug. For Terence McKenna, psychedelic activist and second-wave pioneer, these entities are best described as “self-transforming elf machines.” McKenna is one of the first and loudest activists to speak openly about his (many) DMT experiences.</p><div>

<p>“I encounter self-transforming elf machines, which are creatures, entities perhaps, although they’re not made out of matter,” McKenna <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJjR3aUhsOk">explains in a recorded interview</a>. “They’re made out of, as nearly as I can figure it out, syntax-driving light.” By syntax, McKenna really does mean language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They use a language which you <em>see</em>,” he continues. “It is made out of sound, it <em>is</em> sound, but you see it. And the entire point of the encounter, from their perspective, is to teach you to do this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Language took on visual quality in Ali’s trip, too. “They were speaking and words were coming out of their mouths, just floating along,” he says. Instead, this mysterious speech drifted out like rainbow-glowing vapors constructed out of an indiscernible rune-like language. “It was like captions coming out of their mouths, very cartoon-like,” he adds. “I felt totally focused on it, like I was going to understand it, but I’m not sure that I ever did.” What Ali did understand was the deep-seated feeling of tranquility that presided despite the intense visualizations. “I felt like I was meditating,” he says. It felt intuitive.</p>




<h3><span id="Why_Are_They_Called_Machine_Elves">Why Are They Called “Machine Elves”?</span></h3>



<p>The answer to this question is simple: They’re called “machine elves” or “clockwork elves” because that is the terminology that McKenna introduced to the world. McKenna’s openness and honesty about his personal experiences on DMT created a pathway that others could eventually use to describe and interpret their own psychedelic experiences. Through his description of “machine elves,” McKenna donated trip terminology that has been widely adopted by psychonauts who follow in his footsteps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But machine elves are not unique to McKenna; many people who try DMT relate to features the ethnobotanist described in his trips. Geometric shapes, visualized speech, beings, vibrant colors, and sparkling, ethereal light are commonplace in DMT trips. And yet this isn’t always the case; many people may not even remember their DMT visualizations upon waking from their journey.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><span id="What_Do_Machine_Elves_Look_Like">What Do Machine Elves Look Like?&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p>Forget images of gears, steam, computers, and engine parts. For some people, these “machine elves” can be a far cry from the robotic and mechanized creations we commonly see in sci-fi space operas today—DMT spirits can be fractal, or they can be humanoids, animals, faces, or aliens. They can be merely a presiding voice, or simply the feeling of a presence, or anything else the mind can conjure up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The diversity of the DMT hallucinatory experience was reported early on by famed psychedelic researcher, <a href="https://www.rickstrassman.com/biography/">Dr. Rick Strassman</a>. Strassman is undoubtedly accomplished. He currently holds an associate professorship in psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, but his work and research on DMT span decades. In 2000, he authored the first major book on the hallucinogen, <em>DMT: The Spirit Molecule</em>. Drawing from his <a href="https://maps.org/research-archive/w3pb/1994/1994_Strassman_22714_1.pdf">early research</a>, Strassman tells <em>DoubleBlind, </em>“not that many people in our study saw ‘elves,’ but many saw beings possessing other shapes and forms.”</p>







<p><strong><em>Read: <a href="https://doubleblindmag.com/entheon-dmt-addiction/">This Startup is Developing a DMT-Based Addiction Treatment</a></em></strong></p>







<p>Strassman’s findings are confirmed by more recent research. In 2019, a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWTT4778IIQ&amp;t=910s"> small study of DMT users</a> found that, more often than not, when consumers did see DMT elves, they didn’t look like elves at all. Rather, most entities appeared more amorphous and hard to describe. The study was performed by <a href="https://stockton.edu/social-behavioral-sciences/sobl-faculty-staff.html">Dr. Jennifer Lyke</a>, professor of psychology at Stockton University, who surveyed the popular site Erowid for common descriptions of DMT deities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a much larger study published in the <em>Journal of Psychopharmacology</em>, a research team led by Alan Davis <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881120916143">gathered and analyzed survey data</a> from a grand total of 2,561 different DMT consumers about their best experiences with the hallucinogen. In this study, only 10 to 16 percent of respondents used terms like “angel” or “elf” to describe DMT entities. Instead, words like “being” and “guide” were far more common. Although, it’s important to mention that the vast majority of the study participants were white, male, and Western. In Lyke’s study, 90 percent of the respondents were male.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><span id="What_Do_DMT_Elves_Do">What Do DMT Elves Do?</span></h3>



<div><p>While the visualizations inspired by DMT are certainly noteworthy, it’s the spiritual qualities of the trip that are perhaps the most impactful—and no one can articulate this impact better than Strassman. “The function of the beings is to communicate, and what they communicate is information,” he says. “Their shape or form may contain that information, but more importantly, there is an exchange, a relationship between the observer and the beings, sometimes verbal, sometimes nonverbal. Then it’s up to our mind, our intellect, to decipher the communication, to extract meaning from it.”</p><p>Strassman’s interpretation is supported by data pooled from recent surveys, like the Davis study. According to Davis’ study, most consumers interact with DMT spirits via emotional, intuitive, and telepathic means. These clockwork elves often <em>feel</em> real, like the arbiters of a deep, true, and hidden truth. Many report that experiencing them is a hallmark or life-changing experience, with notable impact on mood, wellbeing, and life outlook.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>In Davis’ study, an impressive majority of psychonauts reported feelings of love, trust, kindness, and joy both coming from themselves and the perceived spirit entities. A large majority of people also reported that they felt like the entities had intelligence, a consciousness of their own. Most felt that they were sacred, that they existed in their own world, and that they had a message to deliver. Over half of those who had identified as atheists before the DMT experience no longer identified as such afterward.&nbsp;</p>







<blockquote><p>Over half of those who had identified as atheists before the DMT experience no longer identified as such afterward.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>







<p>But, Davis and his team aren’t the only scientists to find that DMT can have a positive impact on life outlook. A 2018 study suggested that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5869920/">combining frequent Ayahuasca sessions with mindfulness therapy </a>increased participants’ capacity for acceptance, a key component of mental health. Another study from 2015 found that a single dose of ayahuasca <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25806551/?dopt=Abstract">successfully improved mood in six patients with recurrent depression,</a> even 21 days after treatment. DMT is one of the primary active compounds in the hallucinogenic drink. Although, freebasing DMT, like Ali did, produces a notably different psychoactive experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And of course, this isn’t to say that everyone will have a positive DMT trip. A good number of people may not enter the “spirit realm.” Nor is there any guarantee that experiencing DMT entities will have spiritual significance. For many people, DMT hallucinations may actually be quite frightening. The Davis survey found that 41 percent of consumers felt fear during their experience. A total of 23 percent reported that they felt that the beings had an authoritative presence, 16 percent felt negatively judged by the beings, and 11 percent felt maliciousness—not to mention, how these experiences may be compounded by the health, safety, and legal hazards of experimenting with Schedule I substances.</p>

<p>Getting one over on your opponent is the norm in sports, stepping aside for the greater good is a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The International World Games is due to take place in Alabama&nbsp;in the summer of 2022, but Ireland's lacrosse team, despite having qualified,&nbsp;won't be there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Games, which aim to showcase and provide a pathway to the Olympics for sports&nbsp;who want to take the next step,&nbsp;were supposed to be held&nbsp;next year&nbsp;but the coronavirus pandemic pushed it back.</p>
<p>Ireland had secured a select invite to the men’s tournament, which is&nbsp;run as&nbsp;an abbreviated version of the full game, with six players per team instead of the usual 10.</p>
<p>Only eight teams, based on finishing places at the 2018 World Championships, were picked to take part and Ireland was among that number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we have all seen in recent years what gold runs can do for minority sports&nbsp;on the island, creating profiles and stars and careers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole country rowed in behind the O’Donovan brothers when they pulled like dogs in Rio in 2016.</p>
<p>The Green Army swelled in numbers when&nbsp;Graham Shaw’s side, against all odds, reached the&nbsp;2018 Women's Hockey World Cup&nbsp;final.</p>
<p>Fair weather fans, band-wagon hoppers&nbsp;and Johnny-come-latelys&nbsp;all welcome as the sports built up their profiles on a world stage, encouraging young and not so young to give them a try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ireland&nbsp;Lacrosse CEO Michael Kennedy&nbsp;says&nbsp;the team&nbsp;"punch above their weight" on the international stage so a&nbsp;decent run in a small-field tournament was not beyond the bounds of possibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they’ve just handed away their golden ticket.</p>
<p>There are more important things, reckons Kennedy, than&nbsp;just playing the sport they love, especially not at the expense of another, more deserving brother.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason?&nbsp;The&nbsp;Iroquois Nationals, having placed third in the same tournament from which Ireland qualified,&nbsp;were originally deemed&nbsp;ineligible&nbsp;to compete.</p>
<p>Who, you might ask, are the&nbsp;Iroquois Nationals?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, the sport itself originated among the Mohawk, Cayuga,&nbsp;Onondaga, Seneca, Oneida and Tuscarora Nations, collectively known as the&nbsp;Haudenosaunee&nbsp;Confederacy&nbsp;in the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>They compete in international lacrosse as the Iroquois Nationals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/00152323-614.jpg?ratio=1.5"></p>
<p>They believe that the game is a "medicine", a&nbsp;gift from the Creator, played for his enjoyment,&nbsp;for healing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are the soul of the sport, says Kennedy, and for a men’s lacrosse tournament, making its debut in the World Games, to go ahead without&nbsp;the Iroquois Nationals was not something they could allow.</p>
<p>International World Games&nbsp;organisers&nbsp;initially excluded them on the grounds that they were not&nbsp;a sovereign&nbsp;nation,&nbsp;without an Olympic Committee and therefore could not compete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That upset the lacrosse community across the world and it&nbsp;prompted&nbsp;Kennedy and Ireland Lacrosse to make the ultimate sacrifice, moving aside once the association indicated that decision would be changed if a place could be found for the&nbsp;Iroquois.</p>
<p>"There's something special about lacrosse," Kennedy tells RTÉ Sport.</p>
<p>"It originated with&nbsp;Native&nbsp;American&nbsp;Indians, the&nbsp;Iroquois.</p>
<p>"They are the spiritual&nbsp;part of the game and they say that they received the game from the Creator, it's something&nbsp;special&nbsp;to have that connection.</p>
<p>"There was so much more to be gained for the sport as a whole than for Ireland to gain from that one tournament.&nbsp;It was the right decision to pull out to enable the&nbsp;Iroquois&nbsp;to take part."</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/00152327-614.jpg?ratio=1.25">
<figcaption>Michael Kennedy and Oren Lyons, a key member of the Iroquois leadership</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But it's a decision that comes with a cost for Ireland, who won't benefit from the publicity that they would have gained during the tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That was running through our minds when we were considering this," he says but&nbsp;felt it was worth the short-term pain for the good of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have they considered, as one administrator from&nbsp;a different sporting body did once, of asking to be added to the tournament? Not a 33rd team in this case, but a ninth team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"That has been a topic of conversation between ourselves and World Lacrosse," he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We've been in constant discussions but part of the issue is that it isn’t World Lacrosse that make that decision. It’s the International World Games Association.</p>
<p>"Our sport is targetting&nbsp;the LA Games in 2028. We are the rookie at the table in this event and trying to upset the apple cart by making all&nbsp;kinds of additional requests is a little tricky.</p>
<p>"We&nbsp;would be open to it if&nbsp;World Lacrosse wants to go down that path that would be great for us but we don’t want to push it."</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://img.rasset.ie/00152328-614.jpg?ratio=0.87"></p>
<p>For their part World Lacrosse spokesman Darryl Seibel told RTÉ Sport that Ireland's gesture was "emblematic of the very best ideals of international sport", while the IWGA did not respond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ireland may not get in as the ninth team, or rake in a load of cash for not pestering anyone about it, but there's a chance that karma will come into play when the University of Limerick hosts the 2021 Lacrosse Men's U20 World&nbsp;Championship, originally an U19 tournament supposed to be played last July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There is so much more for us to gain from that event that playing in the 6s in America," says Kennedy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Iroquois&nbsp;leadership is extremely grateful and they want to know how they can help us.</p>
<p>"We want to increase the number of native&nbsp;American&nbsp;teams that come to Limerick next summer."</p>
<p>The Iroquois Nationals Board told RTÉ Sport: "We plan to bring more teams and fans to the tournament and the accompanying festival.</p>
<p>"We look forward to plenty of craic in Limerick next summer, and continuing to build the strong bond we have with Ireland Lacrosse.</p>
<p>"Words do not do justice in expressing the depth of our appreciation for the tremendous sacrifice of Ireland Lacrosse.</p>
<p>"Their genuine concern, empathy, and selflessness demonstrates a true understanding of the ideals of our Medicine Game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We are honored to share the world lacrosse stage with our Irish brethren, and we are especially excited about being part of the [tournament in Ireland]."&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<div><p>To <a href="https://twitter.com/IrelandLacrosse">@IrelandLacrosse</a>,</p><p>

You have gone above and beyond not only for us, but for what you believe is right.<br>
Your actions have spoken louder than words showing everyone the true power of sport, and the spirit of lacrosse.</p><p>

We will never forget that.<br>

<p>It may well be a case of the goodwill Ireland Lacrosse has engendered coming back in spades and perhaps they'll get a taste of their own medicine.&nbsp;</p>

add as a dylib load instruction eventually to my Google Chrome binary.</p><p>I eventually will make a script and dylib that does all this but for now I wrote a quick frida-cycript script to take care of this.</p><h3>Issues I encountered</h3><p>So for some reason.. sometimes.. I can't use 
<code>[NSApplication shared]</code>
to get a reference to the main application.

            <p>TORONTO -- 
	Scientists have examined fossil records from the past 126,000 years and predict an “unprecedented magnitude” of mammal extinctions in the near future.</p>
<p>
	A <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabb2313" target="_blank">new study</a> from the U.S. journal Science Advances looked into the impact humans had on past and present extinction of mammals. Researchers found that human population size in many parts of the world will “undoubtedly pose a serious challenge for the future conservation of biodiversity."</p>
<p>
	Researchers suggest that human activity is almost entirely to blame for the extinctions of mammals in past decades, and will likely be the cause of at least 558 extinctions within the next century.</p>
<p>
	“By the year 2100, we predict all areas of the world to have entered a second wave of extinctions,” the study says. “We find that Australia and the Caribbean in particular have already today entered the second extinction wave [...] we can already see these future scenarios being manifested in parts of the world.”</p>
<p>
	Despite the findings, scientists say there is still a window of opportunity to prevent many species from going extinct by improving conservation efforts.</p>
<p>
	The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently has more than 120,000 species on their red list of threatened species. Many conservation successes have taken place in recent years, with some species moving toward less threatened IUCN categories.</p>
<p>
	The Ethiopian wolf and giant Chinese pandas are two species who have benefited greatly from renewed conservation efforts and public awareness campaigns, according to the IUCN. In Ethiopia, conservationists have been working to preserve the wolf’s existing habitat, and in China, a number of large-scale initiatives have been implemented to protect the panda's main source of food, bamboo. The number of pandas has since increased and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/6/12816588/giant-pandas-endangered-vulnerable-iucn-list" target="_blank">the species has moved from endangered to vulnerable</a>.</p>
<p>
	Researchers say they hope their alarming predictions will “foster increased realization on the urgency and scale of the conservation efforts needed to safeguard the future of mammalian diversity.”</p>
<p>
	According to the IUCN, more than 32,000 are currently threatened with extinction.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="article" id="scroll" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>One of the problems most Kubernetes administrators will eventually face is protecting an Ingress from public access. There are a number of ways to do this, including IP whitelisting, TLS authentication, use an internal only service for the ingress controller, and many more.</p>

<p>One of my favorite ways is to use <a href="https://github.com/pusher/oauth2_proxy">oauth2_proxy</a>. I’ve used it a number of times over the years, but there was always a drawback that bothered me - with the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/auth/oauth-external-auth">documented setup</a> and other countless examples online, they use a deployment of the oauth2_proxy container per deployment/service/ingress that the user is wanting to protect. Although the resource footprint of oauth2_proxy is small, that is needless waste.</p>

<p>Now, onto some oauth2_proxy details. You can use various different providers, like GitHub, Google, GitLab, LinkedIn, Azure and Facebook. What’s one thing nearly every developer in the world has in common? They almost certainly have a GitHub account, so that’s what I use as a provider normally.  There are some strict rules though around GitHub OAuth2 and redirection:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.callumpember.com/assets/attachments/github-oauth2/github-oauth-redirection-rules.png" alt="GitHub OAuth2 Redirection rules"></p>

<p>What this means is that if you are using oauth2_proxy as-is, you need a separate deployment for each domain you want to secure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But I want to secure https://prometheus.mydomain.com, https://grafana.mydomain.com and https://alertmanager.mydomain.com. So I need separate deployments of oauth2_proxy for that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of the box, sadly yes. But with a slight modification of the deployment, we can use a single oauth2_proxy instance for any domain we want. To do this we do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attach an nginx sidecar container to the oauth2_proxy deployment. This container will redirect to anything after <code>/redirect/</code> in the request URI.</li>
  <li>Make the oauth2_proxy have it’s own domain</li>
  <li>Add an upstream to oauth2_proxy for the /redirect path</li>
  <li>Set the cookie domain in oauth2_proxy to include all subdomains</li>
  <li>Setup a GitHub OAuth2 app and point it at the oauth2_proxy domain</li>
  <li>In the ingresses that we want to protect, use the following annotations (replace $DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL with your own domain):</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>---</span>
<span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/auth"</span>
<span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/start?rd=/redirect/$http_host$request_uri"</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="oauth2_proxy-deployment">oauth2_proxy deployment:</h3>

<p>Here is a full, working (at least in my cluster) deployment spec for oauth2_proxy with the nginx sidecar.</p>

<p>If you want to use it, you’d need to replace all the variables. I personally use envsubst in my deployment pipelines for this. The variables that need replacing are <code>$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL</code> <code>$OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID</code> <code>$OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET</code> and you would want to set your GitHub org.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.callumpember.com/assets/attachments/github-oauth2/full-deployment.yml.txt">Full Deployment Spec</a></p>

<h3 id="ingress-example">Ingress example</h3>

<p>Once you’ve got the deployment above working, you can protect an ingress like so (key takeaways are the annotations):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>---</span>

<span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>extensions/v1beta1</span>
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>Ingress</span>
<span>metadata</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>prometheus</span>
  <span>namespace</span><span>:</span> <span>istio-system</span>
  <span>labels</span><span>:</span>
    <span>app</span><span>:</span> <span>prometheus</span>
  <span>annotations</span><span>:</span>
    <span>kubernetes.io/ingress.class</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>nginx-public"</span>
    <span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/auth"</span>
    <span>nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>https://oauth2.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL/oauth2/start?rd=/redirect/$http_host$escaped_request_uri"</span>
<span>spec</span><span>:</span>
  <span>rules</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>host</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>prometheus.$DNS_ZONE_INTERNAL"</span>
    <span>http</span><span>:</span>
      <span>paths</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>path</span><span>:</span> <span>/</span>
        <span>backend</span><span>:</span>
          <span>serviceName</span><span>:</span> <span>prometheus</span>
          <span>servicePort</span><span>:</span> <span>http</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Hopefully this saves you some resources in your cluster and some time creating multiple oauth2_proxy deployments!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/main_ui_sample.png" alt="Main UI"></p>

<p><em>If you want a quick look at the explorer, you can see <a href="http://polyglot-code-explorer.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/">a simple demo here</a> or <a href="http://polyglot-code-explorer-openmrs.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/">a more complex one here</a>.  There is also a documentation site at  <a href="https://polyglot.korny.info/">https://polyglot.korny.info</a> (currently a work-in-progress).</em></p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-the-polyglot-code-explorer">Welcome to the Polyglot Code Explorer</h2>

<p>The Polyglot Code Explorer is an open-source tool for visualising complex codebases written in multiple programming languages.</p>

<p>In this article I am going to explain its purpose, how you can run it yourself, and what it does.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it-for">What is it for?</h2>

<p>Fundamentally, I wanted to answer the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can we visualise large codebases without needing complex language-specific parsers and logic?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Partly I wanted to easily spot toxic code - my colleague <a href="https://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/">Erik Dörnenberg wrote some great articles on Toxic code visualisation</a> and I wanted a way to spot some of these problem areas myself.</p>

<p>But also, I just wanted to be able to explore the code quickly.  I'm a visual thinker, so my main focus is on visualisation - especially when trying to spot patterns in millions of lines of code.</p>

<p>It is far quicker for me to look at a diagram and see some unusual colouring in one area, than to see the same information in a table of numbers.</p>

<h3 id="why-polyglot">Why polyglot?</h3>

<p>Polyglot means "speaking multiple languages" - in this case, it means these tools should work, to some degree, for any text-based programming language.</p>

<p>I've worked in many programming languages over the years, and a lot of them don't have good or easy code quality tools - either they are too new for a community to have built them, or they are from ancient projects where even if such tools exist, getting them up and running is a headache.  And each tool probably produces different metrics in different formats - it's hard to get any sort of big-picture view.</p>

<p>Also many real world systems don't use a single language - often it is better to use specialist languages for different tasks, rather than one general-purpose one.  For example one project might have a UI built in JavaScript and HTML, a microservice built in Kotlin and a platform automation tool build in Rust.</p>

<p>Also I was inspired by reading Adam Tornhill's book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23627482-your-code-as-a-crime-scene">"Your code as a crime scene"</a> - he talks about all the things you can learn from really simple metrics like lines of code, and indentation, and change history.  None of these need a complex language parser - and complex language parsers tend to be touchy and flaky.  Most of my code uses no language parser at all, or just a very simple which can distinguish code from comments.</p>

<p>And finally - supporting all the various languages out there is a lot of work!  Quite a few of the other tools I found linked from Erik's articles, and elsewhere, seem to have parsers for a number of languages - but progress is slow, and often they don't keep up with new languages or language changes.  Staying largely language-agnostic makes it much easier for me to maintain my code, and not have to worry about it stagnating.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-run-the-explorer">How to run the Explorer</h2>

<p>The explorer is actually the front end component of three tightly coupled applications:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/flowchart.png" alt="Tools flowchart"></p>

<ul>
  <li>The Polyglot Code Scanner is a rust application, which scans the source code and produces a JSON data file</li>
  <li>The Polyglot Code Offline Layout tool is a node.js script which adds layout information to the JSON data file</li>
  <li>The Polyglot Code Explorer is a react/D3 web app which provides the user interface for exploring the code</li>
</ul>

<p>The code is open source, you can find it on GitHub:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>I should add a disclaimer - I am not a rust guru, and I am definitely not a react guru!  This is side project code, not commercial-quality - it may well have bugs, mistakes, ugliness, and it has far less testing than I'd usually expect :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may prefer to run these tools from source code - not all the executables have been tested on all platforms! There are some <a href="https://polyglot.korny.info/tools/explorer/howto">more detailed how-to guides on the docs site</a> if you want to build them yourself, or need more details than the brief instructions below.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-executable-files">Getting the executable files</h3>

<p>Each of the tools is packaged up as an executable file - the Scanner is written in rust, so it's easy to just compile a binary.  The Layout app is a node.js script, I've used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg">pkg</a> to build a bundled executable.  And the Explorer can be run as a static website, so the packages are a zipped up bundle of all files needed to build the website, which you can run yourself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scanner executables can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/releases">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-scanner/releases</a></li>
  <li>Layout executables can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout/releases">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-offline-layout/releases</a></li>
  <li>Explorer bundles can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer/releases">https://github.com/kornysietsma/polyglot-code-explorer/releases</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are on a Mac you will need to strip Apple's quarantine attributes from the binary files to avoid the "app is from an unknown developer" error:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>tar </span>zxf polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz
<span>cd </span>polyglot-code-scanner-vwhatever-x86_64-apple-darwin
xattr <span>-d</span> com.apple.quarantine polyglot_code_scanner

unzip polyglot-code-offline-layout-macos.zip
xattr <span>-d</span> com.apple.quarantine polyglot-code-offline-layout
</code></pre></div>
<p>The Explorer is not an executable file - it's a zip file containing the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files needed to run the site.  You can run them locally by running a tiny web server yourself using Python - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server">there are more detailed instructions here</a> or there's a big list of similar servers in other languages <a href="https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255">here</a> - I'll use Python 3 below.</p>

<h3 id="running-them">Running them</h3>

<p>A short sample of running these together might help:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> ~/work
<span>$ </span>polyglot_code_scanner <span>--coupling</span> <span>--years</span> 3 <span>-o</span> my_project_1.json ~/src/my_project
<span># this can be slow for big projects, or if you scan back through many years of history</span>
<span># coupling is optional, remove --coupling to speed it up if you don't want it</span>
<span># Check there are no errors and the my_project_1.json file is there</span>

<span>$ </span>polyglot-code-offline-layout <span>-i</span> my_project_1.json <span>-o</span> my_project_2.json
<span># this can be slow for big files</span>
<span># Check there are no errors and the my_project_2.json file is there</span>

<span># the first time, you need to unzip the explorer files</span>
<span>$ </span>unzip ~/downloads/polyglot-code-explorer.zip
Archive:  polyglot-code-explorer.zip
   creating: polyglot-code-explorer/
<span>$ </span>cp my_project_2.json polyglot-code-explorer/data/default.json
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>polyglot-code-explorer
<span>$ </span>python3 <span>-m</span> http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 <span>(</span>http://0.0.0.0:8000/<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then open a browser to <a href="http://0.0.0.0:8000/">http://0.0.0.0:8000</a> to start exploring!</p>

<h2 id="using-the-ui">Using the UI</h2>

<p>The Explorer front end looks somewhat like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/Main_UI.png" alt="Main UI"></p>

<p>There is more about how to use the UI <a href="http://localhost:2222/tools/explorer/ui">on the docs site</a></p>

<p>The centre of the display shows the files in your project - I'm using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_Voronoi_diagram">Weighted Voronoi Diagram</a> which has the big advantage of showing files roughly in proportional to their size.  And by size I'm using lines of code, which is generally much more useful than bytes - especially as research tends to show that high lines of code is correlated with complexity and defects - so just looking for large lines of code is a good starting point for finding problems.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-by-programming-language">Viewing by programming language</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_language.png" alt="language visualisation"></p>

<p>This view is very simple - it just colours each file by programming language, showing the 10 most common languages.  Mostly useful for getting an overview of what goes where - it's usually easy to spot the front-end vs back-end code by the colours used.  (only 10 languages are shown because beyond that, it's hard to visually see different colours)</p>

<h3 id="lines-of-code">Lines of code</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_loc.png" alt="lines of code"></p>

<p>This view is simple enough - it uses a scale from blue for tiny files, through to yellow for giant files.</p>

<p>Note that this is not a linear scale - a lot of these use what I call a "Good/Bad/Ugly" scale - blue (0) is good, red (1000) is bad, and yellow (10000 and above) is just ugly.  If I used a linear scale, it'd be harder to distinguish the good/bad files from each other.  (yes, I could use a log scale, but that has it's own problems)</p>

<h3 id="indentation">Indentation</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_indentation.png" alt="indentation"></p>

<p>This metric is an interesting one. In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPC.2008.13">Hindle, Abram, Michael W. Godfrey, and Richard C. Holt. 2008. ‘Reading Beside the Lines: Indentation as a Proxy for Complexity Metric’</a> they found that indentation is often useful as a way of looking for complexity - which makes common sense; files with a lot of indentation are often files with deeply nested "if" and "case" statements.  You can choose a few sub-visualisations using the drop-down near the top-left - the default shows the standard deviation of indentation, which is often the most useful metric; you can also see the worst indentation in each file, and the "total area" which is useful for showing files which are both large and deeply indented.</p>

<p>Of course this metric can have false positives - heavy indentation might be due to a particular formatting style for long lines, or an actually valid data structure, or other valid reasons.  But it is often surprisingly useful.</p>

<h3 id="age-since-last-change">Age since last change</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/vis_age.png" alt="age since last change"></p>

<p>This view shows how long it is since each file was changed (from git history) - blue files are recently changed, red files haven't changed in a year, yellow files haven't changed in 4 years.  Note that this is affected by the date selector down the bottom of the page:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.korny.info/2020-09-01-polyglot-explorer/date_selector.png" alt="date selector"></p>

<p>Files that haven't changed at all in the selected date range will show in grey.  You need to select the whole project (drag the left side of the selector to the left of the screen) to see change information across the whole scanned date range.</p>

<p>This is a good/bad/ugly scale again, largely because generally files that haven't changed for a long time are, in my experience, parts of the system that nobody understands or feels safe to touch.</p>

<p>However this is a bit contentious - it depends a lot on the culture of the organisation, and the kind of code - a lot of research in this field shows the flip-side of this, that files that haven't changed for ages are stable. If they had bugs, people would have touched them …</p></article></div></div>

	<p>Here’s one for the Unfortunate Error Message hall of fame.</p>

<p><img src="https://landshark.io/assets/2020-09-06-google-one-bans-separated-families/no-family-for-you.png" width="400"></p>

<p>I got this while trying to add my wife (who is not from the USA) to my Google One storage plan. Apparently Google never counted on family members living in different countries.</p>

<p>I see this as a rather embarassing example of Conway’s Law. Our family structure isn’t compatible with the structure of Google’s business, so no family plan for us.</p>

<p>Hey Google: things are complicated outside of Mountain View. Try putting a little more effort into covering us edge cases. Don’t make us pay for your convenience.</p>

ould be making use of today.</p>
<p>Let's get started 💪</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-the-lessfiguregreater-tag">1. The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>This can be used to mark up a photo. The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element can also contain a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593642634315-48f5414c3ad9"</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"Person using lack laptop computer on brown wooden table"</span> <span>style</span>=<span>"width:100%"</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-the-lessaudiogreater-tag">2. The <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>⁣<code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element provides a way to add audio resources to a web page without the need to use any other plugin.⁣ It's used to play a sound much as music or an audio stream. It supports mp3, wav and ogg.
⁣
A fallback text is enclosed within the tag to be shown to browsers that don't support the element.⁣
⁣
By default, the browser does not show any controls. ⁣
To add the ability for users to play, pause, adjust volume, etc. the 'controls' attribute can be used.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>audio</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"music.mp4"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/mp4"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>source</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"mucis.ogg"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"audio/ogg"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>audio</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h2 id="3-the-lessvideogreater-tag">3. The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>This allows you to embed a media player for video playback. 
It's used to play a video clop or a video stream without embedding youtube or vimeo videos. It supports mp4, webm and ogg.</p>
<p>For example, you can upload your video on AWS S3 and use the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag to embed it on your website.</p>
<p>You can also specify certain attributes, such as width, height, autoplay, loop, controls, etc.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>video</span> <span>width</span>=<span>"960"</span> <span>height</span>=<span>"540"</span> <span>controls</span>&gt;</span>

<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>progress</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"57"</span> <span>max</span>=<span>"100"</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>progress</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="5-the-lessmetergreater-tag">5. The <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>You can use the meter element to measure data within a given range (a gauge).</p>
<p>This can be achieved with min and max values or with a percentage.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>meter</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"7"</span> <span>min</span>=<span>"0"</span> <span>max</span>=<span>"10"</span>&gt;</span>7 out of 10<span>&lt;/<span>meter</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>meter</span> <span>value</span>=<span>"0.4"</span>&gt;</span>40%<span>&lt;/<span>meter</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="6-the-lessdatagreater-tag">6. The <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> tag</h2>

<h2 id="7-the-lessdatalistgreater-tag">7. The <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>⁣The <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> tag is used to provide autocomplete feature in the input field of the form.⁣
⁣
It specifies the set of predefined suggestions for the user to input.⁣</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>input</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"text"</span> <span>list</span>=<span>"days"</span> <span>placeholder</span>=<span>"Choose a Day"</span>&gt;</span>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="9-the-lessdetailgreater-tag">9. The <code>&lt;detail&gt;</code> tag</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;⁣detail&gt;</code> tag is used to make collapsible sections when it is required to provide extra information about a subject that users can hide or view by their choice.
⁣
It uses the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tag which specifies the title that can be clicked to expand or collapse the details.⁣</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>details</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>summary</span>&gt;</span>Click To Open<span>&lt;/<span>summary</span>&gt;</span>

    <p>Many of the hard technical skills that make a great manager are testable. You can easily evaluate technical expertise – for example, an engineering manager should demonstrate their ability to produce or at least understand code. Similarly, in-depth discussions will quickly reveal whether someone can clearly and concisely communicate nuanced concepts.</p>

<p>The softer skills of management are more difficult to assess but just as important. Below are a few of the soft skills that I value most highly in managers, some ideas on how to assess them, and common traps.</p>

<h2 id="soft-skill-1-initiative">Soft Skill #1: Initiative</h2>

<p>Managers set the tempo for their teams – if they aren’t actively looking for ways to help the business, they will set an example that being proactive is optional. The sad truth is that once you’re a manager you can survive a long time by simply maintaining existing processes, reacting to personnel issues, or (worse) creating busywork and taking credit. Many managers collect fine paychecks drifting like an inert gas within a broader bureaucratic cloud. To scale a company effectively, managers need to be proactive rather than existing simply to push virtual papers across their desks.</p>

<p>Initiative tends to be pretty obvious when evaluating internal management candidates. For external candidates, I usually ask deep-dive questions about a meaty project from their past. The goal: learn about what they did, their role, and most importantly the “why” behind their decisions, diving into the details of what really went down. A sample prompt: “Tell me about a significant project that you led, and I’ll ask a bunch of questions to dive deeper.” This is usually fun to ask and I expect to learn something new from strong candidates – after all, they know much more than I do about the project they worked on, so if they can’t teach me something that’s a red flag.</p>

<p>Searching for the “why” behind their decisions is a good test for initiative – being able to explain why certain decisions were made indicates that a candidate can think critically about what a project actually needs, rather than just executing on someone else’s plan.</p>

<h2 id="soft-skill-2-emotional-control">Soft Skill #2: Emotional Control</h2>

<p>Management can be stressful, <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/05/07/startup-is-this-normal.html">especially at a high growth startup company</a>. You’re the first point of escalation for all manner of problems: inter- or intra-team conflict, critical last-minute blockers, HR issues, and other corporate delights. You don’t have a safety net to fall back on if a situation gets too heated – you are the safety net.</p>

<p>Managers can’t be emotionally reactive. They need to remain rational even in the face of severe stressors, allowing them to remain unflappable when shit goes down (more calm also comes with experience). Sometimes, the downsides of reacting are minor: if someone says something dumb during a presentation and you visibly scowl, you can cause them to get flustered. Others are much more important: for example, if someone comes into a 1:1 very upset over their compensation, you need to remain calm as it can be disastrous to make promises or comments that could be misconstrued.</p>

<p>This skill is challenging to assess when hiring managers. Unlike in, say, the Marine Corps, it’s frowned upon in the tech industry to throw someone into a stressful situation and assess their emotional control. References are imperfect but can help, and this skillset is one of the reasons that internal manager candidates can be such tempting known quantities.</p>

<p>The very best managers take this a step further and demonstrate durability – the ability to not only exercise control, but to do so repeatedly over months and emerge on the other side energized and positive. High growth companies are challenging, and more significantly, they’re challenging <a href="https://staysaasy.com/scaling/2020/07/29/the-rogue-wave-of-enterprise-saas.html">over a very long time</a> – typically years. People who are a consistent force for optimistic calm are the pillars around which you should build your team.</p>

<h2 id="soft-skill-3-dispassionate-empathy">Soft Skill #3: Dispassionate Empathy</h2>

<p>Managers need dispassionate empathy: the ability to logically breakdown how their teams will react to new situations by viewing things from multiple perspectives – without allowing viewpoints that they’re sympathetic to cloud their judgment. If someone on your team is passed over for a promotion that goes to their teammate, how will they react? If someone gets really tough feedback, how will they handle it? Managers need to be able to assess factors such as incentives and egos as they chart a course for their entire team.</p>

<p>Promotions provide a common example: when you promote someone you’re affirming the behaviors that you will reward (as well as other behaviors that you tolerate…), and everyone else on the team will observe, calculate, and react differently according to their own interpretation. If you promote Alice, will her peer Bob freak out that it was unfair, become apathetic, or work harder? What message will it send to their more junior team member Charlie?</p>

<p>Empathizing with others’ viewpoints dispassionately is surprisingly difficult as there’s little in day-to-day life that prepares you for it. When a friend or family member is in a difficult situation, they’re typically looking for empathy without reservations, and we’re trained as primates to deliver it. Mirroring the emotions of people we’re close to is often a feature, not a bug. Many managers need to fight the urge to over-empathize.</p>

<p>I assess this trait in interviews by asking about challenging situations that occurred on a prior team. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell me about a time that someone asked for something (eg a raise or promotion), and you didn’t give it to them.</li>
  <li>Tell me about a time when a member of your team was in conflict with a member of another team, and you needed to help out.</li>
  <li>Tell me about a time that someone on your team was underperforming.</li>
</ul>

<p>In asking about these scenarios, I’m first looking for the candidate’s ability to articulate the different motivations or incentives involved: do they understand the situation? Did they view it through others’ eyes rather than just their own? I also assess their ability to discuss the situation in a calm way: are they getting emotionally biased?</p>

<p>While emotional life isn’t as cut and dried as a Python script, I find that most great managers can break down situations like an algorithm: look at all of the different incentives and personalities on the team, add a new decision or situation, and guess at what will happen next.</p>

<h2 id="the-soft-skill-trap">The Soft Skill Trap</h2>

<p>Especially for internal candidates for management positions, beware the most common soft skill trap: mistaking a likeable personality for leadership or management aptitude.</p>

<p>It’s easy to misinterpret a gregarious, likeable personality for innate management skill. “Timmy is a ‘people person’ – of course he’ll be able to manage a team!” This is simply not how life works. Timmy might be great as a manager, or he might suck, but in my experience his likeability is unlikely to correlate strongly with the soft skills that matter.</p>

<p>I blame this phenomenon on Hollywood’s stereotypical portrayal of what it means to be a “leader.” Many great managers are gregarious, sociable, and charismatic, but many others are introverted, quiet in group settings, or somewhat socially awkward. I’ve met managers whom I actually somewhat disliked in a social capacity but who were extremely effective at their jobs. However, I have yet to meet a great manager who didn’t take initiative, couldn’t regulate their own emotions, and didn’t understand the incentives that would motivate their team.</p>

<p><img src="https://staysaasy.com/assets/soft_skills/gladiator.jpg" alt="Gladiator">
Good leader overall, but perhaps too much shouting for your average tech company</p>

<p>There’s also a potential element of bias here: does someone seem like they should be in a leadership position just because they’re really confident? Do they feel like they should be in charge because they’re often the loudest voice in the room? These sorts of subjective judgements are also minefields for bias. For a random example, some of the behaviors that say “leader” in American culture scream “jerk” in East Asian culture. I highly recommend assessing management potential according to the dimensions listed above and trying to remove likeability or sociability from your decision calculus.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Great management requires both hard and soft skills. Soft skills are often harder to assess.</li>
  <li>When assessing a manager’s soft skills, look for the following traits: initiative, emotional control, and an ability to understand how others will perceive and react to situations.</li>
  <li>Promoting from within is a great way to remove manager hiring risk.</li>
  <li>Don’t mistake sociability for management skill.</li>
</ul>

September 7, 2020 | https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>i’m writing this like a day after <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90539632/mozilla-vows-mdn-isnt-going-anywhere-as-layoffs-cause-panic-among-developers">big mozilla layoffs</a> that included a lot of people working on cool and important shit.
the consensus i’m seeing is that it reflects mozilla’s search for profit over impact, mismanagement, and disproportionate executive compensation.
this is taking place in a larger trend of corporatization of open source over the past several years, an ongoing open source sustainability crisis, and of course COVID-19, the all-consuming crisis that makes all our other crises worse.
all of this was summed up most concisely by <a href="https://twitter.com/zkat__/status/1293626135142477825">Kat Marchán</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imo, open source as a community endeavor is falling apart right before our eyes, and being replaced by open source as Big Corp entrenchment strategy.</p>

  <p>I mean it’s been happening for a while, but seeing Mozilla sinking like this is just driving the point home for me.</p>

  <p>FOSS is dead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how did we get here?
where even are we?
what happens next?</p>

<p>i am incredibly unqualified to answer any of this - i didn’t show up until right around the peak of SourceForge, i wasn’t there for most of this - but i’m not gonna let that stop me.</p>

<h2 id="names">names</h2>

<p>to start this funeral service for FOSS, we have to unpack the term itself.
“free and open source software” as a term already contains multitudes.
on one hand, “free software”, an explicitly political movement with a decidedly anti-charismatic leader.
on the other hand, “open source software”, defanged and corporate-friendly by design.
the free software people (correctly) criticize “open source” as milquetoast centrism.
the open source people (correctly) criticize “free software” as stubborn idealism fighting tooth and nail to reject the real world as it actually exists.
they have as much in common as leftists and liberals (but they’re more prepared to work together), and although their short-term goals were similar enough that it made sense to lump them together (hence the cooperation), now that the movement is dead i think there’s more to gain from considering them separately.
most software licenses that i’m going to bring up technically qualify as both, but they’re popular with one or the other, so i’ll refer to “free software licenses” and “open source licenses” as licenses that are more directly tied to those movements, even though any given license likely meets both definitions.</p>

<p>i’d say free software died a while ago, and open source went horribly right.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">freedom</h2>

<p>the free software movement, for all its faults, has always known <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en">what it’s about</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The freedom to run the program for any purpose.</li>
    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</li>
    <li>The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbour.</li>
    <li>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>it’s concise, it’s understandable, and it’s… kinda useless.
this point was <a href="https://lu.is/blog/2016/03/23/free-as-in-my-libreplanet-2016-talk/">raised better by actual lawyer Luis Villa</a> (Karl Marx slander notwithstanding), but those freedoms don’t actually mean shit to the average end user.
only programmers care if they have access to the source code, and most people aren’t programmers.
and i <em>am</em> a programmer, and i don’t give a shit.
the freedom to not think about my operating system and just get work done overrules all of those for me, so i use windows.
like, yeah, those things are all in principle nice to have, and between two otherwise equally good programs i’d take the free one.
but they’re really fuckin specific things, and even if i have the freedom to do them i’m not likely to have the ability or desire to do them, so there’s no good reason for me as a user to use software that’s worse in other ways because it gives me freedoms i don’t need.</p>

<p>the free software movement is explicitly political, but its politics suck.
it’s a movement by and for ideological diehards but the ideology is extremely esoteric.
theirs was a losing battle from day one.
so what was it that actually killed them?
i think in a very real way it was the GPLv3.</p>

<h2 id="losing">losing</h2>

<p>the flagship projects of the free software movement are probably Linux and the GNU pile of tools.
the Linux kernel being released under a free software license doesn’t directly create more free software, though, since even things that tie closely to the kernel aren’t obligated to also be free software, and of course user-level applications can have whatever license they want.
and also most of the people using Linux right now are using it by accident, distributed as ChromeOS or Android, neither of which is free software.
so Linux is a win for the free software movement but a useless one.</p>

<p>the GNU userland tools are, for the most part, even more underwhelming.
it may be technically more accurate to call it GNU/Linux, but the only time i remember my linux userland tools are GNU or free software at all is when there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/boring_cactus/status/1166408436386430976">some weird inconsistency between a GNU tool and its BSD equivalent</a>, and that’s not exactly ideal.
gcc had, as far as i can tell, been basically <em>the</em> C compiler for a while, if you weren’t stuck with MSVC or something worse.
the free software movement were stubborn ideologues with weird priorities, but they still had one big technical advantage.
then the GPLv3 happened.</p>

<p>the GPLv2 was pretty popular at the time, but there were a couple notable loopholes some big corporations had been taking advantage of, which the free software people wanted to close.
a whole bunch of people thought the GPLv2 was fine the way it was, though - closing the loopholes as aggressively as the GPLv3 did cut off some justifiable security measures, and some people said that it could do more harm than good.
the linux kernel, along with a lot more stuff, declared it was sticking with the GPLv2 and not moving to the GPLv3.
when your movement says “here is the new version of The Right Way To Do Things” and several of your largest adherents say “nah fuck you we’re going with the old version” that is not a good sign.
around the same time, free software organizations were starting to successfully sue companies who were using free software but not complying with the license.
so big companies, like Apple, saw new restrictions coming in at the same time as more aggressive enforcement, and said “well shit, we want to base our software on these handy convenient tools like GCC but we can’t use GPLv3 software while keeping our hardware and software as locked together as we’d like.”
so they started pouring money into a new C compiler, LLVM, that was instead open source.</p>

<p>and LLVM became at least as good as GCC, and a less risky decision for big companies, and easier to use to build new languages.
so the free software movement’s last technical advantage was gone.
its social advantages also kinda went up in flames with the GPLv3, too: the software that was the foundation for the GPL enforcement lawsuits stuck with the GPLv2.
the discourse over that decision was so nasty that the lead maintainer (Rob Landley; he’ll come up later) started an identical project which he wound up relicensing under an open source license because the lawsuits had completely backfired: instead of complying with the terms of the GPL, companies were just avoiding GPL software.</p>

<p>the free software movement, in the end, burned itself out, by fighting for a tiny crumb of success and then turning around and lighting that success on fire.
the death of free software tells us that we can’t use a license to trick corporations into sharing our values: they want to profit, and if good software has a license that puts a limit on how much they can do that, they’ll put more resources into writing their own alternative than they would spend complying with the license in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="openness">openness</h2>

<p>the open source movement manages to share the same short term goals as the free software movement but be bad in almost entirely disjoint ways.
the <a href="https://opensource.org/about">mission of the Open Source Initiative</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source enables a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process.
The promise of open source is higher quality, better reliability, greater flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is so profoundly different from the free software definition that it’s almost comical.
where free software says “we value freedom, which we define in these ways,” open source says “your code will get better.”
the free software movement was prepared to start fights with corporations that used their work but didn’t play by their rules.
the open source movement was invented to be a friendly, apolitical, pro-corporate alternative to the free software movement.</p>

<p>the contrast between “use free software because it preserves your freedom” and “use open source software because it’s better” is profound and honestly a little disappointing to revisit this explicitly.
free software preserves freedoms i don’t need or care about as a user, but it does at least do that.
open source software is frequently not in fact better than closed source alternatives, and “use open source software because on rare occasions it manages to be almost as good” is an even more underwhelming sales pitch than anything free software can give.</p>

<p>where free software is misguided and quixotic, open source is spineless and centrist.
and as tends to happen with spineless centrism, it has eaten the world.</p>

<h2 id="winning">winning</h2>

<p>if there’s anything corporations love more than rewriting software so it lets them make all the money they can dream of, it’s letting other people do that work for them.
it took a while to take off, because the conservative approach of “keep things closed source” was pretty solidly entrenched in a lot of places, but now even the once conservative holdouts have accepted the gospel of centrism.
corporations have little to nothing to lose by publishing existing source code, and can gain all sorts of unpaid volunteer labor.
if they start a new internal project, important enough that they’re …</p></div></div>

<p>Software Engineering (SWE) is among the most desired jobs nowadays. It is a vibrant and dynamic domain that changed the way we do things, and that improved our lifestyle. It has its own peculiarities, though, with holy wars between groups of people who argue which programming language is better, with haters of JavaScript, scripting languages, and dynamically typed languages, with complete assholes as well as some very nice and considerate people (although this is not related only to SWE).</p>
<p>Even with a global pandemic, software engineers’ workstyle changed only a little. There are many benefits to working as a software engineer, as well as there are downsides. But this article is not about the perks and drawbacks—you can find a myriad of posts on that subject.</p>
<p>There are lots of questions and answers online about how to get into one of the FAANG (facebook, amazon, apple, netflix, google) companies. This article is my experience and some recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="briefly-about-me">Briefly About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience and a keen interest (and 8+ years of experience) in Data Visualization. I am a freelancer on <a href="https://toptal.com/">Toptal</a>, and currently, I work for PepsiCo.</p>
<p>My main stack is Python/Django [REST] on the backend, JavaScript/TypeScript, and all major JS frameworks on the frontend. There are many more things. If you are interested, this is my <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/iulian-gulea">online</a> resume.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning-of-search">The Beginning Of Search</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, switching jobs requires effort. You must not only prepare for the interviews but also spend time on operational stuff like searching for companies to apply, adjusting your CV, etc.</p>
<p>In Jun 2019, while I had a nice job at a NY-based startup, but I planned to move with my family to the United States. And the easiest way to do that was to apply to some companies that provide an H1B visa. Due to some circumstances, we had to stay for at least one year at home, so I decided to slowly, but steadily plan my preparation for interviews at the big tech companies.</p>
<h2 id="the-preparation-phase">The Preparation Phase</h2>
<p>After doing some research, I found out the most common stages of the recruitment process:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical</li>
<li>behavioral</li>
<li>management</li>
<li>analytical</li>
<li>system design</li>
<li>object-oriented design</li>
</ul>
<p>You might not go through all of them. It depends on the job position you apply and on the company. What you will for sure have are the <em>behavioral</em> and <em>technical</em> interviews. <em>System design</em> is often present, especially if you apply to a position that requires experienced candidates.</p>
<p>Let’s briefly describe each type of the interview before moving further.</p>
<h3 id="technicalcoding-interview">Technical/Coding Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview aims at understanding your algorithms skills. Usually, you are given 1, 2, or 3 problems, and you have to solve them in the allocated time (usually somewhere between 15 to 60 mins, depending on the complexity of the problem), considering edge cases and time and space complexity.</p>
<p>There are many platforms online where you can practice solving such problems. Here are just a few to name:</p>
<ul>
<li>LeetCode</li>
<li>HackerRank</li>
<li>Codility</li>
<li>GeeksForGeeks</li>
</ul>
<p>I created a habit of solving at least one problem per day, and in almost ten months, I had solved 299 problems.</p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/leetcode-submissions.png#c" alt="Image of submissions on leetcode"></p>
<p><img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/leetcode-solved-problem-types.png#c" alt="Image with amount and types of problems solved on leetcode"></p>
<p>Another thing to note is that a candidate usually has several technical interviews: over the phone and onsite.</p>
<h3 id="behavioral-interview">Behavioral Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview aims at understanding the competency and soft-skills part of your professional profile. How good can you get along with people, how do you perform and behave in different situations with your coworkers, etc. Some developers see this interview as a useless step (or one with minimal importance). That is a delusional thought. Developers have to work in teams the same way as people in many other professions, and understanding “the human” side of a potential employee is essential.</p>
<p>To prepare for this step, there are lots of resources online about behavioral interviews. _ “Cracking the Coding Interview”_ by Gayle Laakmann McDowell is a book that might help you as well. Actually, it is an exhaustive resource to prepare for interviews, so check it out.</p>
<h3 id="management-interview">Management Interview</h3>
<p>I had this type of interview only at one company. It is about looking for examples of how you deal with different scenarios, usually around being a team player, helpful and engaging. I didn’t really see a difference from a behavioral interview, but it was explicitly labeled a “Management Interview,” so there it is.</p>
<h3 id="analytical-interview">Analytical Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview aims to understand how you work with data, how you make sense of it, and if you have made any data-driven decisions in your previous work. It has minor aspects of a behavioral interview as well, but more focused on your analytical skills.</p>
<h3 id="system-design-interview">System Design Interview</h3>
<p>This type of interview is about designing scalable, distributed systems. It might be tough to prepare for because sometimes you might not have the experience of working on a distributed system. Therefore, you must learn the theory only, without having practical experience.</p>
<p>This step is also more challenging because there are a lot of concepts, use cases, and tools that solve various problems, and you need to know what those are to be able to design a viable solution.</p>
<p>To prepare for this interview, I took the long route (since I had plenty of time). There are many great (and free!) resources on GitHub, and here are the ones that I used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability">Awesome Scalability</a> - a reading list on scalability, availability, principles of distributed systems, best case practices at different companies, and many more. I was reading five articles a day and was almost done with the relevant concepts in 7 months. It gave me a broad perspective on what tools exist out there, what problems other teams and companies face, and how to approach solving those problems.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">The System Design Primer</a> - a similar resource, but much more concise, and focused on the theoretical aspects of the concepts more (rather than providing real-life examples from companies, as in the previous link). But the main advantage of it is that it has examples of system design questions and answers.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook">Tech Interview Handbook</a> offers full support in preparation for the interviews, but I used it for some hints only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="object-oriented-design-interview">Object-Oriented Design Interview</h3>
<p>In OOD, you have to design the interface of some API or class. It aims at understanding how you think in terms of code and how you structure it. There should be some resources online on the topic, but I haven’t prepared for this one additionally since that is what I do as part of my job.</p>
<h2 id="quitting-and-searching">Quitting And Searching</h2>
<p>In March 2020, I decided to quit my job at the NY startup and enjoy some time while I was going to search for a job. I was okay financially and was quite confident I would get a job at some company. But then the pandemic hit, and I got a bit nervous.</p>
<p>Anyway, I needed companies that can sponsor a visa. That’s pretty much all big tech firms. Here is the list of companies and openings I have applied to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Stack Developer @ Google in Zurich</li>
<li>Software Engineer, Core Languages @ Google in Munich</li>
<li>Software Engineer, Engineering Productivity @ Google in Munich</li>
<li>Senior Backend Engineer @ Airbnb in Dublin</li>
<li>Software Developer - Frontend Tools for AWS @ Amazon in Berlin</li>
<li>Software Developer Engineer - Backend @ Amazon in Berlin</li>
<li>Developer Support Engineer @ Facebook in Dublin</li>
<li>Enterprise Engineer @ Facebook in Dublin</li>
<li>Full Stack Software Engineer - Python/JS @ Apple in Zurich</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of these, I had referrals at all companies except Airbnb. So I got a reply from Google for the Full Stack role, both Amazon jobs, the Airbnb one, and Facebook’s Developer Support Engineer. The only email I received from Apple was the one in which they asked me about feedback on the recruitment process. That was weird.</p>
<p>So, it was exciting, and I was looking forward to it!</p>
<h2 id="interviewing">Interviewing</h2>
<p>If you have worked for a corporation, you probably know that things there take time to progress. The most responsible and fast were Google and Facebook, followed by Airbnb, and Amazon being the least responsive and considerate.</p>
<p>The first step at all companies except Amazon was a phone call to discuss about my application. I perceived this step as an ice-breaker where the recruiter gets to know you, that you are a real person, and that you have intelligible English.</p>
<p>After that, there were coding rounds, but things started to diverge, so I’ll describe the experience with each company separately:</p>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p>Google was among my favorites. The experience with the recruiter was among the best I had. Initially, we had a call to introduce myself, and the recruiter told me about the process.</p>
<p>The next step was a coding round with an interviewer. I was delighted about how it went. The code was well commented and organized in testable functions. I walked the interviewer throughout the whole thinking process by telling how and why I’m writing that code. I did introduce a small bug (incorrect upper bound in python’s <code>range()</code> function) that the interviewer showed me immediately, which I fixed. Also, while I was close to finalizing the problem, I figured out some use cases that wouldn’t pass, so I clarified the expected outcome and did the corresponding changes. I even answered a follow-up question, but I didn’t get to code it because of a lack of time.</p>
<p>After waiting for one week, it turned out that I didn’t pass. And the feedback was a bit suspicious to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>the pace was a bit on the slow side</li>
<li>I didn’t account for a bug (the one that he told me about the moment I did it)</li>
<li>I didn’t think about the design of the algorithm and data structures at the abstract level before coding (this one is subjective since I did think and explain my choices)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, it seemed very unfair. The only thing I could do is to tell about this to the recruiter, so hopefully, other candidates will be evaluated more fairly.</p>
<h3 id="amazon">Amazon</h3>
<p>With Amazon, I had the least pleasant experience as a candidate. It took ages until they were responding to emails and moving with the recruitment process. So, after the intro call, I had two rounds of coding exercises for two …</p></div></div>

<p>Quantum physics is one of the most remarkable developments of the 20th century. Until the early 1900s or so, Isaac Newton’s laws of motion dominated the study of the physical universe. They were later ‘upgraded’, for the most part, by Albert Einstein’s theories of relativity, and together, they could satisfactorily explain almost all physical phenomena. These classical theories formed the bedrock on which the entire superstructure of physics rested.</p>
<p>But in the early 1900s, physicists found that subatomic particles like electrons could behave in ways that defied the predictions of classical physics. To explain this behaviour, they formulated the theories and principles of quantum mechanics – together a set of natural laws that could predict the behaviour of electrons and other subatomic particles very well.</p>


<p>Some of the more well-known among these physicists were Einstein, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger and Werner Heisenberg. However, these physicists and others would soon find that the newcomer, while opening new theoretical and technological vistas, also made some strange predictions. For example, it allowed electrons to tunnel through walls, particles to exist simultaneously in two places at once, black holes to evaporate, and information to be exchanged between observers faster than light.</p>
<p>This was a crucial moment in history, when physics was in a state of major upheaval. The familiar classical picture of reality was being disrupted by one that seemed to be too crazy to be true, even as it explained numerous experimental observations that the former could not. Einstein, Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg and others were deeply troubled by its implications. Indeed, they were faced with a personal dilemma: to believe a preposterous theory that worked or discard it for an intuitive theory that didn’t work.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, they discovered that their notion, that the world we see is not reality itself but a projection onto our consciousness, wasn’t completely new. In the ancient Indian texts known as the Upanishads, they found echoes of their theories, and a philosophical foundation to ensure they would no longer be cast adrift by the implications of quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Quantum physics took shape through several counterintuitive discoveries regarding the inconsistent behaviour of light. James Maxwell showed in 1865 that light could be modelled as electromagnetic waves. In 1905, Albert Einstein published his paper on the photoelectric effect, where he proposed that light is composed of tiny massless particles called photons. Louis de Broglie, a French aristocrat, unified these views in 1924 with a bold suggestion that all matter exhibits wave-like behaviour. This proposition, known as the wave-particle duality, opened up a Pandora’s box of arguments that challenge the nature of reality, even its very existence.</p>
<p>According to classical physics, microscopic particles like electrons are solid spherical balls of matter. Quantum physics replaces this picture with something alien to our sensibilities. It says that rather than being in one place, an electron is located in a diffuse cloud of probabilities. If you try to observe the electron, there is a higher probability that you will find it in a denser region of the cloud than a sparser region.</p>
<p>This cloud is represented mathematically by the wave function. And at the heart of quantum physics is an equation that governs how a wave function evolves as time passes. The Austrian-Irish physicist Erwin Schrödinger arrived at it in 1926, and so it’s called the Schrödinger’s equation.</p>
<p>Science writers revel in portraying the tension between the reality described by quantum physics and the reality we perceive through our senses. Since macroscopic objects like trees and cars are composed of microscopic particles like atoms and molecules, which in turn also behave like waves, macroscopic objects should also behave like waves. But this is not what we experience. The computer on which I wrote this article and the device on which you are reading it surely don’t feel like waves!</p>
<p>So when does something stop behaving like a wave and start behaving like a piece of matter, an object composed strictly of particles? Surprisingly, this happens when we observe it.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-copenhagen/">Copenhagen interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics, observing an object causes it to lose its quantum nature and collapse into the classical form we’re used to. This collapse of the wave function implies that the reality we see exists only when we are there to observe it. And an observer does not merely observe reality; she creates it.</p>
<p>If left to themselves, things would remain as waves until somebody observed them. Einstein, who could not reconcile himself with this, summed up the strangeness of quantum physics when he asked a friend, “Do you believe the Moon exists only when I look at it?”</p>

<p>The Upanishads are a collection of Sanskrit texts transmitted orally from teacher to student over thousands of years. While the Vedas prescribe rituals to appease deities, the Upanishads are concerned with the nature of reality, mind and the self.</p>
<p>Schrödinger was first exposed to Indian philosophy around 1918, through the writings of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. An ardent student of the Upanishads, Schopenhauer had declared, “In the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has been the solace of my life. It will be the solace of my death.”</p>
<p>The Upanishads describe the relationship between the Brahman and the Atman. Brahman is the universal self or the ultimate singular reality. The Atman is the individual’s inner self, the soul. A central tenet of the Upanishads is <em>tat tvam asi</em>, which means the Brahman and the Atman are identical. There is only one universal self, and we are all one with it.</p>
<p>The Isha Upanishad states, “the Brahman forms everything that is living or non-living … the wise man knows that all beings are identical with his self, and his self is the self of all beings.”</p>
<p>Schrödinger was fascinated by this thought. According to Subhash Kak’s book <em>The Wishing Tree</em> (2008), Schrödinger <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=MvaG9SA6D2UC&amp;pg=PA7">named his dog Atman</a>, and his conference talks would, by <a href="http://michel.bitbol.pagesperso-orange.fr/Schrodinger_India.pdf">one account</a>, often end with the statement ‘Atman=Brahman’, that he would call – somewhat self-aggrandisingly – the second Schrödinger’s equation. When his affair with the Irish artist Sheila May ended, she <a href="http://books.google.co.in/books?id=n6XZlrJxgFkC&amp;pg=PA292">wrote him a letter</a> that alluded to this fascination: “I looked into your eyes and found all life there, that spirit which you said was no more you or me, but us, one mind, one being … you can love me all your life, but we are two now, not one.”</p>
<p>Quantum physics eliminates the gap between the observer and the observed. The Upanishads say that the observer and the observed are the same things. In his 1944 book <em>What is Life?</em>, Schrödinger took on a peculiar line of thought. If the world is indeed created by our act of observation, there should be billions of such worlds, one for each of us. How come your world and my world are the same? If something happens in my world, does it happen in your world, too? What causes all these worlds to synchronise with each other?</p>
<p>He found his answer, again, in the Upanishads. “There is obviously only one alternative,” he wrote, “namely the unification of minds or consciousnesses. Their multiplicity is only apparent, in truth there is only one mind. This is the doctrine of the Upanishads.”</p>

<p>According to the Upanishads, Brahman alone exists. Everything we see around us is Maya, a distortion of the Brahman caused due to our ignorance and imperfect senses. The Chandogya Upanishad says, “All this is Brahman. Everything comes from Brahman, everything goes back to Brahman, and everything is sustained by Brahman.”</p>
<p>On this, Schrödinger wrote, “… there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing, produced by a deception (the Indian Maya); the same illusion is produced in a gallery of mirrors, and in the same way Gaurisankar and Mt Everest turned out to be the same peak seen from different valleys.”</p>
<p>It is easy to see why such a concept would have appealed to Schrödinger. Quantum physics insists that reality exists as waves, and wave-particle duality arises due to our observation. Because we cannot perceive the true wave nature of reality, our observation reduces it to the incomplete reality we see. This reduction is what we know as the collapse of the wave function. The emergence of Maya thus neatly maps to the collapse.</p>
<p>Schrödinger was not making passing references to the Upanishads; instead, he had wholly internalised their core message. “Myriads of suns, surrounded by possibly inhabited planets, multiplicity of galaxies, each one with its myriads of suns… According to me, all these things are Maya.”</p>

<p>The Upanishads describe how reality arises out of consciousness. But consciousness cannot be found inside our bodies as a substance or an organ. In that case, how can a non-material consciousness interact with and control our material bodies? Exactly where does mind interact with matter? This question is known as the mind-body problem, and has vexed philosophers for a long time.</p>
<p>Since we haven’t been able to locate or explain this interaction, we’re left with a deceptively simple choice: either consciousness or reality doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Most exponents of modern science today lean towards the materialist view – that consciousness is a byproduct of the neurochemical processes occurring in our brain. It depends on these processes and cannot exist without them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Upanishads uphold an idealist view – that consciousness exists by itself, and that the physical world depends …</p></div></div>

September 7, 2020 | https://www.parse.ly/help/api/restful-apis/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.parse.ly/help/api/restful-apis/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If you were to describe the integration approach with the Parse.ly API to a colleague in one line, you
could say, "it's a RESTful API implemented with HTTP and JSON". That's a mouth-full. This page describes some the principles behind the design of the API.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP and HTTPS as transports</strong>: We chose HTTP for its ubiquity. You should
be able to test our API right from your web browser. It should be a single
line of code to start making requests from your programming language of
choice, including JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>JSON as an interchange format</strong>: JSON is a lightweight and human-readable
format.  JSON's only real drawback vs. something like XML is that there is no
good way to define a JSON "schema" to document the formats formally. So, we
will just substitute out a formal schema for documentation and examples.</li>
<li><strong>Documented</strong>: We should document our API and interchange formats in a way
that makes it easy for our users to find what they're looking for and make the
requests and interactions that they need to get their work done. That's what
this documentation is all about.</li>
<li><strong>Practicality beats purity</strong>: There is a lot of talk about "purely RESTful"
APIs out there. But a lot of this talk isn't rooted in reality. REST suggests
you use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. However, making HTTP
requests with a method other than GET is complicated in web browsers. We only
support the GET method, which allows us to support JSON-P and client-side
JavaScript integrations easily. It also means there's one less thing to
remember when working with our API: just use GET.</li>
<li><strong>Meaningful error states</strong>: When there are problems finding requested data or
if a service is down, we should have some well-established error states that
can be handled gracefully by our clients. This also involves being practical:
for example, it might mean returning HTTP status code 200, but with an error
message encoded in the JSON response document, allowing graceful client-side
error handling.</li>
<li><strong>Supports JSON-P</strong>: For purely client-side (JavaScript) integrations with our
API, the most convenient standard available is "JSON with padding", aka
JSON-P. This is not a standard part of REST, but it is supported throughout
our API via the <code>callback</code> query parameter.</li>
<li><strong>Well-tested</strong>: The API should be tested, and, once it leaves "beta" state,
it should be versioned and have a high degree of reliability and consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Performant</strong>: No endpoints should be slow. Practically speaking, most
endpoints should return in &lt;200ms and should rarely take longer than 1000ms.</li>
</ul>

<p>We were inspired in our design guidelines by the excellent book by Leanard
Richardson and Sam Ruby, <em>RESTful Web Services</em>, published by O'Reilly. We
highly recommend you
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529260.do" target="" rel="">pick up a copy of the book</a>
if you ever need to design a service of your own.</p>

<p>As described by the author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use URIs to identify everything that merits being identifiable, specifically, all of the “high-level” resources that your application provides, whether they represent individual items, collections of items, virtual and physical objects, or computation results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote summarizes it best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's important to stress that although REST includes the idea of statelessness, this does not mean that an application that exposes its functionally cannot have state -- in fact, this would render the whole approach pretty useless in most scenarios.  REST mandates that state be either turned into resource state, or kept on the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way the Parse.ly team interprets this guideline is to "prefer stateless
communication, otherwise, idempotence, otherwise, <em>documentation</em>!".  Obviously,
you can't make things stateless, but making them idempotent is probably a good
idea, and if you can't at least make it idempotent, then we better have
documented it.</p>

<p>We assign unique URIs to various analytics listings, metadata drill-downs,
recommendation/search engines, etc. This follows the practice described here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An application might add a few million customer URIs to the Web; if it's designed the same way applications have been designed in CORBA times, its contribution usually is a single "endpoint" -- comparable to a very small door that provides entry to a universe of resource only for those who have the key.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What comes in your mind when you hear the term Passive Income? Well, if you think it is easy money that can be earned while sitting on a beach without doing anything, you are wrong. Yes, it can be an excellent supplementary source of funds for a lot of people, but it requires lots of work as well. Passive income demands an upfront investment and a lot of nourishing in the start. However, after some time, these income streams can sustain themselves and bring you a significant amount of money. We will show the 10 best ways to generate passive income in this article.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What is Passive Income?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">People love to hear about this earning method, yet it is the most misunderstood concept. In simple words, Passive income is when you keep getting paid for work, even after it is completed. It involves royalties from movies, books, songs, etc. It also includes the wealth that comes from investments in the real state or business investments where your physical presence is not necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why is it important?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The reason why everyone must start working on Passive Income ideas is its unmatchable significance. Let's suppose you wake up one day, and out of nowhere, you find out that you are fired from your job. That's where Passive Income proves its worth. The most recent example is the recent lockdown that was imposed by the government due to the Coronavirus outbreak. A lot of people have gone through a financial crisis during this pandemic, except the individuals who had secondary earning sources. So, whenever you lose your job or face any kind of financial hardship, passive income will ensure the cash flow does not stop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to generate Passive Income?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is the most common question asked by the people who are willing to earn through different sources. There are a lot of Passive Income ideas and strategies that can help everyone. Some of them may require a lot of investment, but you can start making money even with as little as $5! Sounds unbelievable, right? We have discussed more of such strategies below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rental Income:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A cash flowing rental property is an excellent way to earn passive income, but it requires a lot of work. Before investing in a real state, you must learn how to make it a profitable investment, otherwise, there are a lot of risks involved. Also, if you want to make it truly passive, outsourcing your property to a management company is the best option. However, this is not something you can start with a little extra cash.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dividend Stocks:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is an authentic and tested way to earn passive income. Your job will be to do extensive research and find good stocks where you can invest money and receive a significant number of dividends. If you keep investing in dividend stocks, you can accumulate a good residual revenue with time. Choosing the right company to invest in is the tricky part. If you succeed in selecting the right company, you will receive payment at regular intervals.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peer-to-peer Lending:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peer to peer, commonly known as P2P is the method of lending money to borrowers who do not qualify for conventional loans. This kind of lending is usually facilitated by a third-party agent, such as LendingClub. As a lender, your income source will be the interest payments made on the loans. However, there is some risk factor as the loan is unsecured.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Affiliate Marketing:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are a social media influencer, a blogger, or a website owner, this method can be the best option for you to earn some extra cash. It is a commission-based job, where you promote a third party's product on your website, and on every purchase, you will get your share. The most popular affiliate partner is Amazon, but there are other platforms like Awin, ShareASale, and eBay as well. Please remember that you will need to invest a lot of time in the start to attract traffic on your website.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Investing in CDs:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are a risk-averse person, investing in Certificates of Deposits (CD) can be a pretty good option for you. It is often more profitable to go with an online bank than your local bank. This way, you will be able to select the best rate of return available in your country.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Selling Information Product:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you are good at something, you can always record an audio or a video course and sell it to interested people. Also, writing an E-book can be a pretty good source for earning passive income. The only problem with this method is that you must put a lot of effort into creating such a product. Some popular examples in this regard are Udemy, Coursera, Skillshare, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">REIT:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Real Estate Investment Trusts are specially made for people who are not comfortable investing directly in the real state. REITs have a kind of legal structure that enables them to pay little to no corporate income tax if they pass along most of their revenue to shareholders. You can easily purchase the shares of REITs from the Stock Market just like other companies.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Invest in a Business:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is another great way to make passive income. You can invest in a business and be a silent partner. This is the riskiest method we have discussed until now, but if you are a risk-taker, you will understand the high returns that are associated with high risk. For example, did you know that Uber and Lyft were looking for private investors once? Well, both of these companies are worth billions now!&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Car Advertisement:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Earning money while driving your car around town - doesn't it sound fascinating? Well, it surely does, and a lot of people are doing it. You can contact any experienced advertising agency, and after making some inquiries, they will link you to one of their advertisers.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Renting out a room in your house:&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is a straightforward method of earning passive income. In simple words, you are taking advantage of the space that you were probably not using anyway.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ideas discussed above are only a few out of hundreds through which you can make passive income easily. It is about time we start looking for additional income sources that can improve our living. However, there is no such thing as easy money. If you are looking for high returns, make sure to put the significant effort.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I recently started dabbling with quantum computing, and this post is kind of the introduction I wish I’d found before I started.&nbsp; It’s not intended to be anything other than a very small tip of a very big iceberg.&nbsp; Hopefully, this will give you enough to help you know if quantum computing is worth your time, what to expect if you start, and some links to resources I’ve found useful.&nbsp; Also, “beginner’s” has a double meaning – it’s <em>for</em> a beginner, <em>by</em> a beginner – I’m probably in ‘knows enough to be dangerous’ territory.</p>



<p>Also, “practical” is there on purpose, because this will be about what’s involved in writing code on your own computer.&nbsp; I won’t be going into theory much, or its consequences for society etc.&nbsp; I’ve played with only the Microsoft Quantum Computing stack (details below), so this post will be in that context.&nbsp; If you search for <em>Quantum Development Kit</em> online you can find alternatives, but I don’t know how they compare to Microsoft’s.</p>



<p>I was inspired to start dabbling by the podcast <a href="https://feeds.captivate.fm/impact-quantum/">Impact Quantum</a>, which is from the same people (<a href="http://franksworld.com/">Frank La Vigne</a> and <a href="https://andyleonard.blog/">Andy Leonard</a>) as do the podcast <a href="http://datadriven.tv/">Data Driven</a>.&nbsp; This blog is also partly because of the <a href="https://www.ministryoftesting.com/">Ministry of Testing</a> <em>I wish I knew</em> blogging challenge (more below).</p>



<h2>Getting started – the short version</h2>



<p>Even though quantum computers aren’t generally available, you can write quantum computing code today on normal hardware (such as your laptop) with the aid of emulators.&nbsp; These help your laptop to present a quantum-computing-like interface, but the lack of proper quantum computing hardware means that the emulator (and hence your code) will run more slowly than the real thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will probably limit the scope of what you can realistically tackle, as big things will simply take too long.&nbsp; The good news is that when quantum computers do eventually become generally available, the code you’ve been running against emulators should run unchanged (and much faster) on the real thing.</p>



<p>With all that out of the way, here’s the short version of how to get started.&nbsp; (There’s a longer and less simple-sounding version, and also links for where to download things, below.)</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Download Visual Studio Code (not Visual Studio) if you don’t already have it.&nbsp; It can run on Windows, OS X and Linux.</li><li>Download the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, which is an add-on to Visual Studio Code.&nbsp; This includes a quantum computing emulator, and support for the language Q#.</li><li>Write programs in Q# and run them.</li></ol>



<p>This assumes an awful lot of important details, some of which I’ll go into below.</p>

<h2>Quantum computing programs</h2>



<p>Before I go into some of the lower-level details, I ought to describe quantum computer code in general because it’s not like any normal code that you’ve already written.&nbsp; (There’s a section below where I draw comparisons with other bits of computing I’ve already used, but they’re more helpful when you’ve already got the idea than in trying to introduce it.)</p>



<p>Pretty much all the quantum code I’ve seen relies on the quantum theory phenomenon of <em>superposition</em>.&nbsp; (Some uses <em>entanglement</em> or <em>quantum tunnelling</em>, but these seem rare enough to ignore at least for now.)&nbsp; Without going into the brain-melting details, what this means for your code is that instead of variables having exactly one value at a time (which could be null or a random unassigned value, or which could change often) special variables called <em>qubits</em> can have all possible values <strong>at the same time­</strong><em>. </em>This is quantum computing’s main secret sauce – the ability to evaluate many alternatives very quickly i.e. in parallel.</p>



<p>Yes, this is very weird and takes some getting used to.&nbsp; You can have normal variables that have only one value at a time (as you’d expect), but the power comes from the qubits.&nbsp; These have all possible values at once until a point in the code where you decide to <em>measure</em> their value.&nbsp; At this point, the multiple possibilities and related weirdness evaporate, and you have a single value as per normal computing.&nbsp; From here on there’s no more quantum secret sauce, so you tend to do this as late as possible.</p>



<p>This doesn’t sound very useful, because it seems like variables start off with all possible values, and then magically pick one possible value at random.&nbsp; This isn’t true but the reality involves more weirdness and details.</p>



<p>Before the point of measurement, a qubit is an array of N values (actually, 2: for 0 and 1).&nbsp; The values in the array aren’t the candidate values that measurement picks from.&nbsp; Instead, the value in element X of the array is the probability that measurement will pick that element’s value.&nbsp; I.e. element 0 is the probability that you will end up with 0, and element 1 is the probability you will end up with 1.</p>



<p>To initialise a qubit, you set the correct probabilities for the different elements in the array.&nbsp; The operations that make up your code then modify the probabilities, including the relationship between the probabilities inside qubit A and the probabilities inside qubit B.&nbsp; Then, at measurement time, the computer effectively rolls dice to decide which value to pick per qubit, based on the probabilities that were around by then.&nbsp; I tend to think of this as: <strong>quantum code deals in meta data rather than data</strong>.&nbsp; The numbers that slosh around in the code are probabilities associated with values, rather than the values themselves.</p>



<p>Note this adds yet another bit of weirdness – quantum code is probabilistic rather than deterministic.&nbsp; Correctly-constructed code <em>should­ </em>produce the correct result <em>most</em> of the time.&nbsp; I.e. if you ran the same correctly constructed code many times with the same inputs you might get different outputs per run, but <em>most</em> of the time the outputs will be correct.</p>



<h2>Getting started – the much longer version</h2>



<p>You can probably see now why the shorter version of getting started was a bit on the unhelpfully optimistic side.&nbsp; The good news is that it doesn’t appear that you need to understand quantum theory beyond a fairly superficial level to write quantum computing code.&nbsp; However, there are probably still quite a few barriers to overcome.</p>



<p>The first potential barrier is the fact that qubits and operations on them are expressed in terms of matrices.&nbsp; You might already be familiar with them, you might have dim memories from long ago, or they might be completely new.&nbsp; This is things like tensors, transposing etc.</p>



<p>The second potential barrier is the probabilistic nature of the code, and probability is another thing you need to know and be comfortable with, at least a bit.</p>



<p>The third potential barrier is the fact that the probabilities in the matrices are expressed in terms of complex numbers, i.e. numbers that might include a multiple of <em>i</em> – the square root of -1.&nbsp; This also comes with its own set of notation, such as <em>Dirac notation</em>.&nbsp; This means you’ll see things like |a&gt; (pronounced “ket a”), &lt;a|(“bra a”), &lt;a|a&gt; (“bra-ket a”), |+&gt;, |-&gt;, |0&gt; and |1&gt;.</p>



<p>Complex numbers mean that each number will have two parts.&nbsp; In general, a number will be of the form <em>x + iy</em>, where <em>x </em>is called the real part and <em>iy</em> is the imaginary part.&nbsp; You might think that you will therefore be dealing with diagrams that have numbers on a 2D number plane rather than a 1D number line.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this isn’t always true – you will also see a single probability displayed on the surface of a sphere (called a <em>Bloch sphere</em>).</p>



<p>Points on the surface of a sphere have only two degrees of freedom (e.g. <a href="https://randomtechthoughts.blog/2020/07/05/how-far-away-is-the-eu/">longitude and latitude</a>), even though they exist in 3D space, so you might be asking why a 3D representation of a complex probability helps.&nbsp; I.e. imagine a sphere with x, y and z axes, where the y axis goes through the North and South poles.&nbsp; If you have a point on the surface and you increase longitude while keeping latitude constant, the point draws a circle through space.&nbsp; The circle will be on a plane of constant y, and x and z will trade size as the point goes around the circumference of the circle.</p>



<p>The short and possibly not very helpful answer is that different useful operations rotate a point (a particular probability) around the x, y and / or z axes, like when you twist the different faces of a Rubik’s cube.&nbsp; Just as combining a pattern of twists of a Rubik’s cube about the different axes can produce useful outputs (e.g. unscrambling it), quantum operations combine patterns of rotations about all three axes to do useful work.</p>



<p>A slightly longer answer is that the size of a point’s probability is determined by two of its three co-ordinates.  The third co-ordinate, its <em>phase</em>, is an extra property of the point that you can effectively put in the point’s back pocket, and then use later to affect the two main co-ordinates.  (Rotating the point about e.g. the y axis means that its x and z values swap around.  You can use the extra co-ordinate to swap a new value into one of the main co-ordinates via rotations.)</p>



<p>Once you’ve understood enough quantum theory concepts (superposition on its own seems to take you a long way), matrices, probability and complex numbers, you then have the relatively simple task of learning Q#.&nbsp; It’s a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for quantum computing, that’s a bit like C# and a bit like F# (apparently).</p>



<p>You are now in the position of understanding someone else’s Q# code.&nbsp; You might be able to write new Q# code, which is likely to involve working out how to re-frame the problem at hand in terms of problems that already have quantum computing solutions, such as <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/tree/master/GraphColoring">graph colouring</a>. You might even be able to solve new kinds of problems using Q# code if you’re much cleverer than me.</p>



<p>Q# code is one way of creating qubits and using the standard quantum operators, but the other quantum development kits are alternative ways to interact with …</p></div></article></div>

<p>At 16:09 EDT on 04 Sep 2020 (about 26 hours ago), SalesForce (the owner of web hosting company Heroku) notified us that they had suspended the Ruqqus live and test server environments, with account termination to follow twenty-four hours later.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, we have not been given a reason as to why we were being kicked. I do not believe we violated Heroku ToS (though Heroku may think otherwise) and we did not exceed Heroku usage limits. Our account manager was friendly but was unfortunately unable to provide us with any information. It is my opinion that by not warning us first (ex. "please remove X which violates Heroku's acceptable use policy") that Heroku actually violated their own terms of service.</p>
<p>We immediately downloaded all of the Ruqqus data, and began working on setting up shop at another host.</p>
<p>I'd like to give a massive shoutout to <a href="https://ruqqus.com/@p2hang"><img src="https://ruqqus.com/@p2hang/pic/profile">@p2hang</a> for lending his considerable expertise in support of getting Ruqqus operational as quickly as possible. He is the third recipient of the super-rare Fire Extinguisher badge.</p>
<p>All (or at least, almost all) functionality is restored. There are a few things which aren't quite yet back to normal, which I hope to fix over the course of tonight and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><del>hCaptcha verification issues on attempted signups</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Custom guild colors are currently disabled. This was an intentional decision by me, as there were issues loading the style files needed for custom coloring, so it was easier to just disable that for the sake of getting up and running.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Notification bell stuck on.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>Lastly, and most importantly, we have no idea how well the current server will be able to handle user load. For that reason, I will be continuing to monitor and make adjustments as needed. Performance may be spotty and unreliable as load resumes.~~ ~~Doesn't seem to be an issue, but we'll have to see how it goes with everyone trying to get on.</del> There are some load/efficiency problems that I'm trying to sort out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del>hCaptcha on signup is malfunctioning.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><del><a href="http://i.ruqqus.com/">i.ruqqus.com</a> image uploads don't save.</del></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most recent 30k or so comments didn't make it into the new host. Also possibly some post votes. I <em>think</em> all the comment votes made it in. The missing data is something I'm still working on, but you will probably see rep fluctuating unpredictably as vanished stuff is no longer counted.</p>

<![CDATA[Java: The Programmer Environment That Has It All]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Let me start with an admission: it took me <em>weeks</em> to work out what to talk about for the Java issue of <em>De Programmatica Ipsum</em>. There is just so much to it.</p>
<p>I recently took <a href="https://github.com/iamleeg/grotag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a twelve-year old Swing app</a> and—with no code changes and minimal project changes—compiled it on the latest JDK. It now runs on the latest Java Runtime Environment, and every JRE back to 2014’s version 8 (which is still supported for Oracle customers until December 2030, by the way). The previous version: no code changes, just built on an earlier JDK, worked back to at least 2004’s J2SE 5.0 release. So I could talk about the phenomenal compatibility and future-proofing of Java programming.</p>
<p>However, that Swing UI does not necessarily look the best, so I thought maybe I could talk about the embarrasment of riches available when it comes to designing user interfaces for Java software. The original, classic Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) is still there, and still not deprecated, so I <em>could</em> make the UI out of native platform widgets. Then my code would be compatible back to the first-ever release of Java, back in 1995. Or I could use something more modern: <a href="https://openjfx.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaFX</a> and <a href="http://pivot.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pivot</a> are the choices for working with marked-up UI files like Microsoft’s XAML, Apple’s Interface Builder, or Vue.js. A more Java-ish way to build UIs is <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/swt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipse’s SWT</a> with the <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JFace</a> helpers.</p>
<p>If I am modernising, why would I limit myself to Java? The JVM ecosystem directly supports interesting languages like <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clojure</a>, <a href="https://scala-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scala</a> and <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotlin</a>. And then there are JVM-native ports of <a href="https://www.jython.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.jruby.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.redline.st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smalltalk</a>, and others. That is before we even start on the possibilities when you switch to a modern runtime environment like <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraalVM</a>.</p>
<p>I could carry on. This has not been merely a fraction of the Java-based technology available, it has been a fraction of the Java-based technology <em>I have used</em> in the last couple of decades. We did not talk about build systems, about server technologies, about education environments, about developer environments, about mobile, about smart cards…</p>
<p>Because that is the <em>real</em> story of Java. Once the ownership questions had been sorted out by Apple’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2076580/apple-releases-macos-runtime-for-java--mrj--version-2-0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac Runtime for Java</a> dying out, by <em>Sun versus Microsoft</em> killing the (deliberately incompatible) Microsoft JRE, by Sun’s open-sourcing their own implementation to create the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenJDK</a>, we were left with the simple observation: the Java Runtime Environment is everywhere computers are (give or take), and the Java Developer Kit lets you do whatever your developers are interested in.</p>
<p>And all of that in a hassle-free, continuous way. No “ground-up rewrite” to support some new language the senior dev on your team insists is the next big thing: JVM classes all interoperate so you let them try their thing on the edges of your existing, well-maintained project. Some people see that as tedium: they observe code that is steeped in the 1990s design patterns phraseology, like <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/aop/framework/AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean</a>, and see this as a sign of a staid technology, beloved of managers but not deserving serious technical interest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, others see signs of <em>success</em>. That code (actually from 2006) is still there because, well, it is <em>still there</em>, because its authors did not get distracted by the shiny shiny and get bogged down in another rewrite, because as manufacturers and markets came and went, the Java runtime was still there, and the bytecode could still execute.</p>
<p>Some of the people who do not use Java have good reasons. Many of the “write once, run anywhere” people are getting the same value out of Google’s Chromium runtime environment. Others have hitched their carts to a particular vendor’s horse and get more support (from the vendor and the associated community) by using that vendor’s tools. But for many people, the Java Runtime Environment represents the most widely-adopted computer ever designed, and the wealth of technologies available in the ecosystem represents a broad guarantee that when they reach for “the best tool for the job”, it is available for their platform.</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-7388da95-7fff-ab6f-4399-0e6afe849600">State and local governments have been a<a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/tech-data/2020/08/ransomware-attacks-demanding-larger-payouts-local-governments/168055/"> favorite target</a> of hackers using ransomware and other cyberattacks in recent years.</p><p>Rather than leaving these governments to face down threats alone, a new pilot project aims to help them bolster their online defenses by automatically identifying potentially troublesome IP addresses and malware files for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Information technology agencies in four states and one county are participating in the program, which uses security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) tools to share intelligence on cyber threats and automatically take action to protect systems against them. The pilot is using a framework developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p><p>Relying on indicators of potentially malicious activity on a system or network flagged by the<a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/ms-isac/" target="_blank"> Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center</a>, the states are able to respond quickly to suspected cyber threats.</p><p>“We just want to help the states augment their current capabilities because of the growing threat and there are only so many staff that agencies can bring into the problem,” said Charles Frick, Jr., the APL's lead investigator overseeing the project.</p><p>If suspect IP addresses or untrustworthy domains can be flagged proactively, the technology can alleviate some of the current heavy workload of cybersecurity analysts, Frick said. Depending on how state and local governments chose to set up the process, a detected threat could automatically be shut down or banned from the network, or once data is collected on the potential threat, an analyst could take up the process to determine next steps. Either way, cybersecurity professionals say the program will be a timesaver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A simple process like looking up an IP address to determine if it’s operated by malicious actors may take less than 10 minutes to do manually, said Lester Godsey, the chief information security officer for Maricopa County, one of the jurisdictions participating in the pilot program. But it’s the type of task that the county’s six-person team spearheading the program has to do hundreds of times a day.</p><p>“If you do it 50 to 100 times a day, that is a significant time savings over the day,” Godsey said.</p><p>Arizona, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Texas are also participating in the program. Frick said the program expects to release some initial results from the pilot at the end of September.</p><p>Local governments have struggled at times to keep up with the continued threat of ransomware or cyberattacks. A coordinated ransomware attack that targeted<a href="https://www.routefifty.com/tech-data/2019/08/coordinated-ransomware-attack-texas-escalation/159295/" target="_blank"> 23 Texas municipalities</a> last summer was seen by security experts as a particularly bad example of the worsening escalation of cyberattacks on local governments.</p><p>States have taken measures in recent years to enhance their security postures, at times<a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/tech-data/2020/02/cybercriminals-attack-states-help-cities-punch-back/162858/"> coming to the aid</a> of municipalities as well.</p><p>Last year, Ohio established a volunteer “<a href="https://www.routefifty.com/tech-data/2019/10/ohio-establishes-cyber-reserve-combat-ransomware/160889/" target="_blank">cyber reserve</a>,” a civilian unit of the National Guard, that will be called on to assist local governments in the face of ransomware or cybersecurity attacks. Others have turned to<a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/tech-data/2019/10/protection-cyber-insurance-ransomware/160387/"> cyber insurance</a> to help pay for the costs of restoring their computer systems if they are compromised during a ransomware attack.</p><p>Maricopa County had already begun to delve into automation of security processes before the pilot, Godsey said. But the program has allowed the county’s Office of Enterprise Technology to focus on identifying the workflow processes best suited for automation. It also provides the county with a higher degree of confidence that the information used to flag potential cyber threats is accurate, he said.</p><p>Overall, Frick said a local government’s cybersecurity operations need to be fairly mature to support the automated process.&nbsp;</p><p>If agencies have not experimented with automation, Frick said the best way to prepare for the process is to take a hard look at the workflow associated with cybersecurity operations. Once staff understand and document the steps in place as part of the manual process, they will be better prepared to automate the process.<svg>

<p>A common trope in hiring is the lack of experienced candidates. This is certainly thought to be true for the entire tech industry, but it’s especially compounded for minority candidates: “it’s a pipeline problem”. On the flip side, the question inexperienced developers face is how they can gain experience without having prior experience.</p>

<p>No matter what type of experienced candidate you’re trying to hire, <strong>your company needs to invest in its junior employees</strong>. That means provide them with mentorship, formal training, and the opportunity to work on meaningful projects. But, there are some common objections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Building up experienced candidates takes time, when you need them <em>now</em>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Employees will take the investment you put into them and go to another company. Now, the other company will get an experienced candidate without paying the upfront cost.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It sounds like you’re better off asking developers to level up on their own time.</p>

<p>However, <strong>like many hard problems, the root cause is systemic</strong>. If every company invested in their industries, there would be a large pool of experienced candidates moving from employer to employer. This is, fundamentally, the <em>only</em> way to end up with experienced candidates in the system.</p>

<h2 id="the-prisoners-dilemma">The prisoner’s dilemma</h2>

<p>The problem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">a prisoner’s dilemma</a>: it’s best for all the employers to work together, training their employees. In return, they all get access to the trained candidates who move around in the future. But, like in the prisoner’s dilemma, one company doesn’t know what the other companies will do, so the best strategy seems to not reward other companies with trained candidates.</p>

<p>Luckily, there’s a silver lining here. It still makes sense to invest in your employees for two reasons.</p>

<p>Most importantly, your employees will be happier! You’ll still have to compete on pay, of course, but if someone is being treated well, wouldn’t they want to stay around for at least a little longer?</p>

<p>Besides, you’re not alone, even today. The big tech companies, like Google and Facebook, are absolutely investing in their employees. These companies have extensive formal training programs, structured mentorship and a wide variety of interesting problems for engineers to solve. In fact, investing in your employees may be another plus for those looking to jump out of the big tech companies.</p>

<p>Basically, if you’re not investing in your employees, you’re already falling behind.</p>

<h2 id="effective-investment">Effective investment</h2>

<p>Finally, there’s the question of <em>how</em>: how do you build up your employees into experienced engineers. I’ve already talked about a few ways, but let’s get into some more detail.</p>

<p>First, provide <em>formal</em> training programs, including mentorship. This means giving developers access to the experienced engineers in your company, and giving the experience engineers guidance on how to mentor others. But, it also means classes and educational material employees can take advantage of. Think paid classes to learn a new skill, the way I learned mobile development.</p>

<p>Next, send engineers to conferences, or better yet, coach them to speak at conferences and other industry events. Engineers need access to resources outside your company too. As a side effect, the company ends up with representation within these industry events, which can help with recruitment down the line.</p>

<p>Finally, let developers stretch themselves on harder projects. With the right guardrails and mentorship, this is exactly how engineers gain experience.</p>

<hr>

<p>Investing in your employees is key to creating an industry with a healthy level of experienced engineers to draw from. Along the way, the investment results in happier employees and more recruitment opportunities. And despite the fact it seems less than ideal to do this investment alone, you’re not actually alone: the most coveted companies are already ahead of the game here.</p>

	<p><small>September  7, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the ways that <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a> (the code behind <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a>) is unusual is that it strictly validates the query parameters
it receives on URLs, including on HTTP <code>GET</code> requests for ordinary
pages. If a HTTP request has unexpected and unsupported query
parameters, such a <code>GET</code> request will normally fail. When I made
this decision it seemed the cautious and conservative approach, but
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/CautionIsAMistakeToday">this caution has turned out to be a mistake on the modern web</a>. In practice, all sorts of sites will
generate versions of your URLs with all sorts of extra query
parameters tacked on, give them to people, and expect them to work.
If your website refuses to play along, (some) people won't get to
see your content. <strong>On today's web, you need to accept (and then
ignore) arbitrary query parameters on your URLs</strong>.</p>

<p>(Today's new query parameter is 's=NN', for various values of NN
like '04' and '09'. I'm not sure what's generating these URLs, but
it may be Slack.)</p>

<p>You might wonder how we got here, and that is a story of lax behavior
(or, if you prefer, being liberal in what you accept). In the
beginning, both Apache (for static web pages) and early web
applications often ignored extra query parameters on URLs, at least
on <code>GET</code> requests. I suspect that other early web servers also
imitated Apache here, but I have less exposure to their behavior
than Apache's. My guess is that this behavior wasn't deliberate,
it was just the simplest way to implement both Apache and early
web applications; you paid attention to what you cared about and
didn't bother to explicitly check that nothing else was supplied.</p>

<p>When people noticed that this behavior was commonplace and widespread,
they began using it. I believe that one of the early uses was for
embedding 'where this link was shared' information for your own web
analytics (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/AnalyticsVsSecurity">cf</a>), either based on your logs
or using JavaScript embedded in the page. In the way of things,
once this was common enough other people began helpfully tagging
the links that were shared through them for you, which is why I
began to see various 'utm_*' query parameters on inbound
requests to <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/">Wandering Thoughts</a> even though I never
published such URLs.
Web developers don't leave attractive nuisances alone for long, so
soon enough people were sticking on extra query parameters to your
URLs that were mostly for them and not so much for you. Facebook
may have been one of the early pioneers here with their 'fbclid'
parameter, but other websites have hopped on this particular train
since then (as I saw recently with these 's=NN' parameters).</p>

<p>At this point, the practice of other websites and services adding
random query parameters to your URLs that pass through them is so
wide spread and common that accepting random query parameters is
pretty much a practical requirement for any web content serving
software that wants to see wide use and not be irritating to the
people operating it. If, like <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/DWiki">DWiki</a>, you stick to your guns and
refuse to accept some or all of them, you will drop some amount of
your incoming requests from real people, disappointing would be
readers.</p>

<p>This practical requirement for URL handling is not documented in
any specification, and it's probably not in most 'best practices'
documentation. People writing new web serving systems that are
tempted to be strict and safe and cautious get to learn about it
the hard way.</p>

<p>In general, any laxness in actual implementations of a system can
create a similar spiral of de facto requirements. Something that
is permitted and is useful to people will be used, and then supporting
that becomes a requirement. This is especially the case in a
distributed system like the web, where any attempt to tighten the
rules would only be initially supported by a minority of websites.
These websites would be 'outvoted' by the vast majority of websites
that allow the lax behavior and support it, because that's what
happens when the vast majority work and the minority don't.</p>

The demo runs at around <a href="https://notcoding.today/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0a383a3a6c7a794a3b3a323a7a">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>, with the following PC spec:</p><pre><code>CPU: Ryzen 2600
GPU: GTX 960
RAM: 16 GB</code></pre><p>Yes, I need an upgrade :P</p><h2 id="planting-grass-and-swaying-in-the-wind">Planting grass and swaying in the wind</h2><p>Follow <a href="https://youtu.be/usdwhhZWIJ4">BotW style grass tutorial by lonegamedev</a>. In this tutorial, you will:</p><ul><li>Generate custom mesh with triangles representing grass.</li><li>Generate randomized continuous pattern that represent wind.</li><li>Create shaders that will change vertex position according to the wind.</li></ul><p>The result looks something like this:</p><p><img src="https://notcoding.today/images/godot-interactive-grass/wind_strong_compressed.gif" alt="Strong wind"></p><p>I personally am not a fan of how winds are exaggerated in BotW. I tweaked the shader parameters to make it look more natural:</p><p><img src="https://notcoding.today/images/godot-interactive-grass/wind_gentle_compressed.gif" alt="Gentle wind"></p><p>Unfortunately, the tutorial does not cover light shaders (it uses built-in default diffuse and specular shader). This is fine (as long as you use bulit-in toon diffuse), but we want to make grass wet <em>partially</em> and with fine control. I implemented a simple Blinn-Phong shader. It looks something like this:</p><pre><code>diffuse = DIFFUSE_LIGHT + LIGHT_COLOR * ATTENUATION * ALBEDO;

<span>vec3</span> h = <span>normalize</span>(VIEW + LIGHT);
<span>float</span> gloss = <span>3.5</span>;
<span>float</span> ndoth = <span>dot</span>(NORMAL, h);
<span>float</span> intensity = <span>pow</span>(<span>max</span>(<span>0.0</span>, ndoth), gloss*gloss);
<span>float</span> specular_value = <span>smoothstep</span>(<span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>, intensity);
specular = (is_tip*<span>0.95</span> + <span>0.05</span>) * specular_value * LIGHT_COLOR * (<span>0.01</span> + <span>0.035</span> * wetness);</code></pre><p>Note that <code>wetness</code> variable is set elsewhere. This is covered later. Note that <code>NORMAL</code> has also been rotated around. This is also covered later.</p><h2 id="step-able-grass">Step-able grass</h2><p>The aim is to bend the grass according to physical constraints - someone stepped on it or something is pushing it. With wind sway implemented from above, grass' pitch and yaw are set from a generated value. From here, I think there are two ways of extending the wind sway to make the grass 'step-able':</p><ol><li>Grass shader can keep track of objects that enter its area. Physical information should also be passed into the shader. This is similar to how simple lighting shaders are created from scratch.</li><li>Grass shader has a texture channel that defines pitch/sway value. Wind sway can add on top of this.</li></ol><p>The first solution has bad faults - passing in arrayed data is limited in optimization and extendability. Furthermore, we want the shader to focus on manipulating vertices and fragments, not figure out game logic.</p><p>The second solution allows us to do complex calculations outside shader code and simply pass in the results as a texture. We'll cover later why this is extremely advantageous.</p><h3 id="implementation---logic">Implementation - logic</h3><p>We are going to introduce a texture that wraps the entire grass area. We need to define UV coordinates for the vertices. Reminding ourselves that a single mesh instance is created for all the grass pieces in an area, we can map our UV coordinates as the following:</p><p><img src="https://notcoding.today/images/godot-interactive-grass/uv_example.jpg" alt="UV example"></p><p>The <em>position</em> of the vertex <em>within the area</em> determines the UV coordinate. This means a pixel in the texture map will map to the specific area of grass.</p><p>One catch is that, if you followed the grass tutorial above, UV and UV2 channels are being used for something else. This is fine, we have color channel empty! Note that the grass colour is being derived elsewhere so we can use vertex colour channel. The planter script will contain something like this:</p><pre><code>
rel_pos.x = (pos.x + span) / span / <span>2</span>
rel_pos.z = (pos.z + span) / span / <span>2</span>
multimesh.set_instance_color(index, Color(rel_pos.x, rel_pos.y, rel_pos.z))</code></pre><p>Now that we can pass in 4-dimensional float data (rgba) to a group of grass, we can define a new texture channel as the following:</p><pre><code>r: pitch amount
g: nothing
b: yaw amount
a: how much generated wind impacts</code></pre><p>We can map float values like the following:</p><ul><li>Color 0.5 = 0 degrees sway/pitch. This means color 0.0 = -90 degrees, 1.0 = 90 degrees.</li><li>Alpha 1.0 = full wind impact. Alpha 0.0 = no wind impact.</li></ul><p>Here are some examples:</p><pre><code>Color(0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.0) = normal. No sway, no pitch, generated wind fully impacts.
Color(0.0, 0, 0.5, 0.5) = Pitch by -90 degrees. Generated wind only impacts in half the strength.</code></pre><h3 id="implementation---script">Implementation - script</h3><p>We first initialize dynamic texture:</p><pre><code>func init_wind_texture():
  wind_img = Image.new()
  wind_img.create(wind_texture_size, wind_texture_size, false, Image.FORMAT_RGBA8)
  wind_img.fill(Color(<span>0.5</span>, <span>0.0</span>, <span>0.5</span>, <span>1.0</span>))
  wind_img.lock()

  wind_img_texture = ImageTexture.new()
  wind_img_texture.create_from_image(wind_img, <span>0</span>)

  multimesh.material_override.set_shader_param(<span>"wind_override"</span>, wind_img_texture)</code></pre><p>We can now modify this texture to apply 'stepping'.</p><p>I think the most generic 'stepping' shape is a circle. In order to create a smooth sphere, we need to get <em>gradient</em> of the sphere at each point. I did this by simply 'stepping' to the direction instead of insane vector calculous:</p><pre><code>func draw_wind_override_circle(pos_x, pos_y, rad, strength=<span>1.0</span>, noise=<span>0.0</span>, step_factor=<span>0.01</span>):

  <p><span>06 Sep 2020</span></p><p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce7nvF45GNk">recent live-coding session</a>, I tried to build a website uptime monitor with <a href="https://pipedream.com/">Pipedream</a>. Even with a few digressions, I managed to get most of it done within the hour, and figured that the process and platform were worth sharing.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="some-pipedream-context">Some Pipedream Context</h2>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar, Pipedream is a severless platform with a particular focus on making it easy for developers to integrate with external services. I was introduced to it as “Zapier + AWS Lambda,” which doesn’t quite do it justice, but does convey the general idea.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Pipedream provides the ability to build <a href="https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/">workflows</a>, which are a series of steps that can run code (Node.js) and interact with external services. These can be <a href="https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/triggers/#app-based-triggers">triggered in a variety of ways</a>, including email, HTTP/webhooks, a growing number of apps, and of particular interest to this post, via a cron schedule<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Within the Node.js steps, you can install and use most npm packages, and you can set and pass variables along the steps of your workflow.</p>

<p>All of this seemed pretty powerful, and after getting a feel for the platform, I wanted to use it to make something practical. So, I set out to make a workflow for monitoring my blog’s uptime.</p>

<h2 id="the-uptime-monitor-workflow">The Uptime Monitor Workflow</h2>

<p>So as not to bury the lede too far, here’s the <a href="https://pipedream.com/@mjclemente/website-monitor-p_KwCrmN/readme">finished workflow</a>, that you can use or customize to suit your needs. And here’s an outline of the steps it currently uses:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Trigger</strong> - Because I wanted to check the uptime of my blog regularly, I used the <a href="https://docs.pipedream.com/workflows/steps/triggers/#cron-scheduler">Cron Scheduler</a>. Depending on how aggressive you want to be with monitoring, you could have it run the workflow every minute. Just keep in mind that these will eat into your daily free compute limit<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, so a more relaxed schedule - say every 5 minutes - might be more appropriate for a non-critcal website.</li>
  <li><strong>Make the HTTP request</strong> - I’m using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">axios</a>, but you could use <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/http-requests-in-node-js.html">any number of approaches</a> to making the HTTP request. When building your workflow, you’ll want to make sure that it’s handling error response codes properly. I used <a href="https://httpstat.us/">httpstat.us</a> to simulate 400 error codes while testing. I also decided that monitoring the response time would be helpful, so I added this, using <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios#interceptors">axios request/response interceptors</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Determine if the website is down</strong> - Based on the result of the HTTP request, this step returns a boolean parameter, indicating if the website is down. Nothing fancy here - if it doesn’t return a 200 response, it’s considered down.</li>
  <li><strong>Send an alert email (or not)</strong> - The job of this step is to send the downtime alert email. However, in most cases the website isn’t down. There isn’t a built-in way to skip steps in a workflow, so the body of this function is wrapped in an if-statement, evaluating the boolean result of the previous step. If it’s not down, it doesn’t send the email.</li>
  <li><strong>Bonus - track metrics with Datawaves</strong> - While not necessary for uptime monitoring, this additional step provides some interesting reporting/analytics about the website being monitored. While browsing Pipedream’s <a href="https://docs.pipedream.com/apps/all-apps/#apps">list of integrated apps</a>, I came across <a href="https://datawaves.io/">Datawaves</a> - an event analytics platform that provides a generous free tier. So, I set up a free account and the results of the uptime check (status code, status text, and request duration) get pushed into Datawaves. In their dashboard, I can easily analyze the results of my uptime checks - average response duration, number of downtime results, etc. Pretty nifty!</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s it - a free, and pretty powerful website uptime monitor with Pipedream.</p>

<p>Now, there’s certainly more that we could do to improve this workflow. For example, we could limit the frequency with which the error alert emails are sent - because if you’re checking the uptime every minute, you probably don’t want an email every minute about it being down. We could also build in some degree of fault tolerance; for example, if you’re checking every minute, don’t send the alert unless you get two consecutive downtime readings. And, while we’re brainstorming, we could abstract the workflow further, triggering it via a webhook and passing in the website dynamically; that way we could use it to monitor multiple websites. All that said, I think it’s a perfectly sufficient starting point.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re interested in trial and error, here’s the live-coding session where I started the project.</p>

There are scenarios in which it is useful to monitor or manipulate this traffic, instead of letting it happen as-is.</p> <h2 id="request-interception"><a href="#request-interception">#</a> Request interception</h2> <p>Request interception enables us to observe which requests and responses are being exchanged as part of our script's execution. For example, this is how we could print them out when we load our <a href="https://danube-webshop.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test website</a>:</p>  <p>We might want to intervene and filter the outgoing requests.

This functionality is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/1774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not yet available in Playwright</a>.</p> <p>Every time we load it, our test website is sending a request to its backend to fetch a list of best selling books.

                    <div>
                        <p>Danielle became a programmer after learning to code at <a href="https://makers.tech/?utm_campaign=NoCSdegree&amp;utm_source=paulablog">Makers</a> coding bootcamp in London. She now works as a Front End Developer at UK telecoms giant Vodafone. In this interview she talks about her transition from musician to developer, her experience learning to code at Makers and her tips for beginners on getting better and getting hired.</p><h2 id="hey-can-you-introduce-yourself">Hey, can you introduce yourself?</h2><p>Hiya! I’m Dani, a frontend developer at Vodafone. I'm normally based in their London office when not working from home in beautiful Richmond. (gotta find the silver lining in 2020). Originally hailing from sunny South Africa, I’ve been a performing musician for as long as I can remember.</p><p>Although my former career as jazz pianist and vocalist only really took off during a 4-year stint in Dubai in 2010. After that I moved back to South Africa with my partner (now husband). I took up copywriting, emigrated to the UK and decided I wanted to learn to code. &nbsp;</p><p>I spent 4 months on a luxury cruiseliner entertaining people and saving up money. I came back to London, adopted the loveliest tabby moggie on the planet, and got into Makers (woohoo!). I landed my job at Vodafone in week 10 of the course and started to work there 3 weeks after graduation. 20 months later I’m still there!</p><h2 id="what-does-a-typical-day-as-a-software-developer-at-vodafone-look-like-for-you">What does a typical day as a software developer at Vodafone look like for you?</h2><p>I’m in the team responsible for checkout. Like most tech companies we follow Agile methodologies. So a typical day starts with enough time to grab a coffee and catch up on emails and unfinished tasks from the previous day. This is followed by a standup meeting at 10:15 am during which we briefly share things the rest of the team need to know (blockers, dependencies, tasks outside our scope, etc.). </p><p>Once a week our scrum master will use this time to quickly go over the Azure DevOps board. It help us tetris-slam those blockers and get back to what we do best - solving problems by building stuff with code (and drink coffee). </p><p>After that we’ll each pick up or carry on with a ticket. I mostly work solo, sometimes pairing and sometimes in mob-sessions if there’s a conundrum that needs looking at from more than 2 angles. During permanent lockdown everyone’s encouraged to take 12-1pm off completely. As in “move away from the computer.” There’s a strong mental health initiative at Vodafone which I greatly appreciate. </p><p>The rest of the day is spent coding, making and reviewing PRs. I also liase with other teams in Vodafone on data, APIs, environments, and testing and creating independent releases. I have fun in the Slack Random channel, and attend company meetings/lightning talks/workshops.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-first-get-interested-in-coding">How did you first get interested in coding?</h2><p>My husband is a brilliant self-taught principal frontend engineer. I’ve been watching from the sidelines for years, but was too scared to try it for myself. Don’t get me wrong: I wanted to. I felt that I had waited too long to start, and I had no idea where to start, and the longer I waited… well, you get the gist. </p><p>As a kid I was always on my dad’s computer; I loved logic-based puzzles and was that nerdy girl on our school’s chess team. I still regret not having learnt the basics of programming then. Times were different, especially in South Africa, and I had my music to focus on. </p><p>Fast-forward to December 2017. It was pretty much a combo of me itching to learn. Plus, some health issues made my 8 gigs-a-week schedule less appealing and viable as a full-time job. As well as a desire to challenge myself on a cognitive level… and I’ve definitely succeeded there! </p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/07/hackathon-dani--1-.jpg" alt="Dani at a Hackathon" srcset="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/hackathon-dani--1-.jpg 600w, https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/hackathon-dani--1-.jpg 1000w, https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/07/hackathon-dani--1-.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="what-attracted-you-to-the-makers-coding-bootcamp">What attracted you to the Makers coding bootcamp?</h2><p>I initially found out about another London-based bootcamp, Founders &amp; Coders. It sounded amazing. But the entry requirements were pretty strict for an absolute beginner. I decided to train for it anyway. If I didn’t get accepted by their next application date then I’d probably be ready for a junior dev role anyway. In April 2018 I looked at different bootcamps again. </p><p>Makers was the only one that appealed to me. They weren’t ageist in the slightest (I was 35 at the time). They had a plethora of success stories. The people there seemed genuinely happy. &nbsp;The one thing that put me off was that it seemed too good to be true. I applied all the same, and the rest is magical did-this-really-happen history.</p><h2 id="what-did-you-enjoy-about-learning-to-code-at-makers">What did you enjoy about learning to code at Makers?</h2><p>Everything. </p><ul><li>Dana (Chief Joy Officer/therapist/yoga instructor/awesome human being)</li><li>the students and the coaches</li><li>the culture</li><li>the excitement of learning and applying new theories all the time </li><li>the ancient brick building letting sun dance through its giant windowsthe workshops, </li><li>the lunchtime excursions</li><li>the “aha!” moments when an alien concept suddenly hit home</li><li>the pairing exercisesthe staying-until-7:30pm-to-soak-up-all-the-knowledge days</li><li>the lovely angels who clean and run the show, Johanna and Kinga</li><li>the falling-over-and-laughing-at-yourself yoga sessions- the District Line hour each way with my laptop making tests fail then pass</li><li>the free fruit and breakfast goodies (and fresh bread with Nutella at the start of the week)</li><li>the caring career team. </li></ul><p>I’m terrible at ping pong, but that too would be on my list if I weren’t. Mainly, Makers gave me hope, and the belief that I could really be a dev. It was a wonderful time (even though I burnt myself out over weekend projects).</p><h2 id="what-advice-do-you-have-for-someone-without-a-cs-degree-who-wants-to-get-into-programming">What advice do you have for someone without a CS degree who wants to get into programming?</h2><p>Start small, and keep going. Find a good resource that works for you. I’ll forever sing freeCodeCamp’s praises. Then work through it and reference trusted guides. W3Schools when you’re new, and MDN docs when you’re more competent and confident. There’s a LOT of info out there and it’s easy to get sucked into the rabbit hole of “patching a problem” and “throwing sh** at a wall”. Also, read books and blogs on programming. And take breaks! </p><p>If you don’t want to be a script-kiddy who copy-pastas (which you don’t, I promise you), then practice writing from scratch. You’ll of course learn from copying examples first, but the only way to actually become a coder is to code. </p><p>Make peace with the fact that people who studied CS will probably have a wealth of knowledge drilled into them. To this day I know and understand music, especially Jazz theory, better than most professional performing musicians I’ve met. But that doesn’t mean that I’m better than them. On the contrary. A lot of them are masters at their instruments because they practice. And that’s what makes them brilliant. </p><p>If you’re learning on your own, it’s a good idea to go to regular meetups with &nbsp;coaches and people at your level. Free Code Camp’s online community is a great starting point. You can’t go wrong with #100DaysOfCode on Twitter either. TL;DR? Don’t be intimidated, work hard, use good source materials, read books, take breaks, code from scratch, go to meetups, and have fun.</p><h2 id="have-you-ever-had-imposter-syndrome-as-a-developer">Have you ever had imposter syndrome as a developer?</h2><p>Um, I had constant imposter syndrome as a lifelong musician. So needless to say it followed me into the world of Javascript, NodeJS, React, MobX, Jest, Codecept, Docker, WebPack and AWS. </p><p>The amount of times I’ve channelled the “I have no idea what I’m doing” Golden Retriever is embarrassing. It’s also hard sometimes to know whether it’s imposter syndrome or whether you’re really just not cut out for this job. I’ll give you a hint: it’s imposter syndrome. My secret for beating it? Always learning and improving, and gathering empirical evidence of my accomplishments. Being nice to yourself doesn’t hurt, either.</p><figure><img src="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/07/dani-panel-talk-voda-paddington.jpg" alt="Dani talks on a panel discussion at Vodafone" srcset="https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/dani-panel-talk-voda-paddington.jpg 600w, https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/dani-panel-talk-voda-paddington.jpg 1000w, https://www.nocsdegree.com/content/images/2020/07/dani-panel-talk-voda-paddington.jpg 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="how-did-you-get-your-first-job-before-even-completing-the-makers-course">How did you get your first job before even completing the Makers course? </h2><p>Sometimes after years of struggle, upheaval, stress, and hopelessness, all your determination pays off. There <em>is</em> light at the end of the career-change tunnel. Throughout the course the career coaches would meet with students. They would find out what we wanted and what our strengths were. During week 9 Elspeth Coates, asked me whether I was up for meeting Rob Greville, the head of development at Vodafone. He would interview nine other candidates - &nbsp;all Makers alumni - for two junior frontend roles. </p><p>I was the final interviewee of the day. He was genuinely enthusiastic about Vodafone transforming from a telecoms into a tech company. Plus the fantastic dev culture they were building, so when he asked me if I wanted to do the tech test I nearly saluted. And when I saw the test, a simple UI spec, I thought: I can do this. But if I wanted the job I had to do it in React, a framework I hadn’t touched yet, and with tests. </p><p>I recreated the designs in HTML, CSS and jQuery. Ben Tomkins, a friend and former Maker, told me exactly what Udemy course to do at 1.5 speed. He graciously lent me his expensive headphones so that I could complete it at class. Thus I learnt React’s barebone-basics in a few hours, and applied it to my test in a few days. </p><p>My husband told me about PropTypes and did a quick sanity check before I submitted the final product. A few days later I got the email offer! It was a good week. :) After that, I had the pleasure of having the amazing Lauren Lindsey as my programme manager for the year. She made sure I was in good hands and she checked in weekly.</p><h2 id="what-are-your-career-ambitions-for-the-future">What are your career ambitions for the future?</h2><p>I want to become really good at development. There’s so much to know, and there’s always a better way of doing things. New versions/methods/libraries/frameworks are always being released. So at the moment I’m focused on refining my knowledge and usage of React functional components with hooks. We use classical components with MobX state management at work. Also, TypeScript, and performance improvements. </p><p>Maybe I’ll build a few handy delightful-to-use apps first, but a game is the long-term goal. As long as I’m also part of the creative storyboarding and UX/UI, I’m happy. I’d also like to get involved …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p><a href="https://app.qvault.io/">My team</a> has been spending less of our “free” time working on bugs and features from the backlog, and more time refactoring our codebases and test suites. As a result, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we’ve noticed a significant increase in our throughput of features and bug fixes.</p>



<p>As it turns out, its easy to find bugs and add features to a well-written codebase that the entire team is familiar with. Go figure.</p>



<p>My team started a loose goal to spend 25% of our time refactoring, revisiting, and restyling existing code and tests. Let’s go over some of the benefits we’ve seen since making the change.</p>



<h2>Context and Caveats</h2>



<p>I’ve found that in articles like this it’s important to give as much context to the situation as possible, as certain development methodologies may work better or worse in teams with a different size, tech stack, or development process. Here are some notable things about our situation:</p>



<ul><li>3 engineers on my team, ~16 in the company</li><li>Tech stack – Go, Postgres, ElasticSearch and RabbitMQ</li><li>Microservices architecture on Kubernetes</li><li>Kanban-style development process – <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/05/18/leave-scrum-to-rugby-i-like-getting-stuff-done/">no scrum</a></li><li>Our team is responsible for ~14 repositories</li><li>Each repo represents a small service in a data pipeline process that handles sorting and NLP of social media posts</li></ul>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png" alt="Go Kubernetes" width="512" height="296" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-1024x592.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-300x173.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-768x444.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes-150x87.png 150w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/go_kubernetes.png 1245w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" title="go kubernetes"></figure></div>



<h2>Code Familiarity</h2>



<p>With only 3 engineers on the pipeline team and ~14 repositories (Mostly REST APIs and ETL processes), it was hard for all three of us to be super familiar with all the code. When we needed a new microservice, one team member typically wrote the first iteration, and one other team member did a quick code review. The engineer who did the first iteration would then be primarily responsible for bug fixes and new features relating to that project.</p>



<p>By focusing more of our time on reviewing and refactoring existing code, it gave us a chance to hop into projects that we never would have had a reason to become familiar with. Not only does getting more eyes on a project mean the overall code quality will likely go up, but it also means we aren’t hosed when the original maintainer has gone.</p>



<h2>Slow to Fix Bugs</h2>



<p>When you get deep into spaghetti code, it can be really hard to find bugs. Not only that but in a messy codebase, sometimes fixing a bug can actually <em>add</em> to the “uncleanliness” of the code. You may have to exacerbate or extend an already bad architectural pattern in order to get a bug fix in.</p>



<p>Ideally, you would do the refactoring first and then fix the bug (assuming the bug still exists after a good refactoring). Unfortunately, oftentimes there isn’t enough time to refactor a project before fixing a critical bug. For this reason, we should always be refactoring so that bug fixes can happen quickly and won’t make the code quality worse than it is.</p>



<h2>Slow to Add Features</h2>



<p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse, the reasoning here is largely the same as with bug fixes. Adding features to a messy codebase just makes it messier. It’s like frosting a cake that’s been thrown on the ground – it might taste marginally better but now it’s even harder to clean up.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="261" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/happy_birthday_to_ground.gif" alt="Happy Birthday to the Ground" title="happy birthday to ground"></figure></div>



<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>



<p>Since adding a consistent refactoring process to our team’s routine, we’ve been able to put <em>more</em> features through to production while spending <em>less</em> time working on them. Let me know what you think and if you have a different experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <div>
    <p>For the past few months, I’ve been running a handful of SSH Honeypots on some
cloud providers, including <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a>,
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/b2cffefc9c81">DigitalOcean</a>, and
<a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1380239&amp;u=2497236&amp;m=46483&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">NameCheap</a>.
As opposed to more complicated honeypots looking at attacker behavior, I decided
to do something simple and was only interested in where they were coming from,
what tools might be in use, and what credentials they are attempting to use to
authenticate.  My dataset includes 929,554 attempted logins over a period of a
little more than 3 months.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a big surprise, I’ll go ahead and let you down easy: my
analysis hasn’t located any new botnets or clusters of attackers.  But it’s been
a fascinating project nonetheless.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="honeypot-design">Honeypot Design</h2>

<p>With a mere 200ish lines of Go, I implemented a honeypot server using the
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh?tab=doc"><code>golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code></a>
library as the underlying implementation.  I advertised a portable OpenSSH
version as the server version string (sent to clients on connection).  I then
logged each connection to a SQLite database, including the timestamp, IP
address, client version, and credentials used to (attempt to) authenticate.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-credentials">Analysis of Credentials</h2>

<p>In a surprise to absolutely nobody, <code>root</code> is by far the most commonly tried
username for login sessions.  I suspect there must be many attackers trying
lists of passwords with just <code>root</code> as the username, as 78% of attempted logins
were with username <code>root</code>.  None of the remainder of the top 10 are particularly
surprising, although <code>usuario</code> was not one I expected to see.  (It is Spanish
for <code>user</code>.)</p>

<p>Blank passwords are the most common attempted passwords, followed by other
obvious choices, like <code>123456</code> and <code>password</code>.  Just off the top 10 list was a
surprising choice of password: <code>J5cmmu=Kyf0-br8CsW</code>.  Interestingly, a Google
search for this password only finds other people with experience running
credential honeypots.  It doesn’t appear in any of the password wordlists I
have, including <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists">SecLists</a> and
others.  If anyone knows what this is a password for, I’d love to know.</p>

<p>There were a number of other interesting passwords such as <code>7ujMko0admin</code>, used
for a bunch of networked DVRs, and also known to be used by malware attacking
IoT devices.  There are other passwords that don’t look obvious to a US-centric
view of the world, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>baikal</code> – a lake in Siberia</li>
  <li><code>prueba</code> – Spanish for test</li>
  <li><code>caonima</code> – a Mandarin profanity written in Pinyin</li>
  <li><code>meiyoumima</code> – Mandarin for “no password”</li>
  <li><code>woaini</code> – Mandarin for “I love you”</li>
  <li><code>poiuyt</code> – <strike>The name for an optical illusion also known as the "devil's tuning
fork"</strike> <strong>Edit:</strong> multiple redditors pointed out this is the begginning
of the top row of the keyboard from right to left.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also dozens and dozens of keyboard walks, like <code>1q2w3e</code>, <code>1qaz@WSX</code>,
and <code>!QAZ2wsx</code>.  There are many more that took me much longer to realize they
were keyboard walks, such as <code>4rfv$RFV</code> and <code>qpwoei</code>.</p>

<p>It has actually fascinated me to look at some of the less obvious passwords and
discern their background.  Many are inexplicable, but I assume they are from
hardcoded passwords in devices or something along those lines.  Or perhaps
someone let their cat walk across the keyboard to generate it.  I’ve certainly
had that experience.</p>

<p>Overall, the top 10 usernames and top 10 passwords (not necessarily together)
are:</p>

<p>Again, no real surprises here.  <code>ubnt</code> is a little bit higher than I would have
thought (for Ubiquiti networking gear) but I suppose there’s a fair bit of their
gear on the internet.  It’s interesting to see the mix of “lazy admin” and
“default credentials” here.  It’s <em>mildly</em> interesting to me that all substrings
of the first 10 digits (3 or longer) are included, <em>except</em> for 7 digits.  I
guess 7 digit passwords are less common?</p>

<h2 id="timing-information">Timing Information</h2>

<p>Though I imagine these kind of untargeted scans are long-term processes
continually running, I decided to check and see what the timing looked like
anyway.  Neither the day of week analysis nor the hour of day analysis look
like there’s any significant variance.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/days_of_week.png" alt="Day of Week">
<img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/hours.png" alt="Hour of Day"></p>

<p>Looking at the number of login requests over the time period where I’ve been
running the honeypots shows the traffic to be intermittent.  While I didn’t
expect the number to be constant, the variance is much higher than I expected.
I imagine a larger sample size and more nodes would probably make the results
more even.</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/dates.png" alt="Day of Study"></p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-sources">Analysis of Sources</h2>

<p>So where are all of these requests coming from?  I want to start by noting that
<em>none</em> of my analysis is an attempt to attribute the actors making the requests
– that’s just not possible with this kind of data.  There’s two ways to look at
the source of requests – in terms of the network, and in terms of the (assumed)
geography.  My analysis relied on the IP to ASN and IP to Country data provided
by <a href="https://iptoasn.com/">iptoasn.com</a>.</p>

<p>Looking at the country-level data, networks from China lead the pack by a long
shot (62% of all login attempts), followed by the US.</p>

<p>Again, I’m not claiming that these countries mean anything other than location
of the autonomous system (AS) that originates the requests.  I also did not do
individual IP geolocation, so the results should be taken with a small grain of
salt.</p>

<p>So what networks are sourcing this traffic?  I have the <a href="https://systemoverlord.com/static/attachments/gopot/asns.csv">full AS counts and

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/asns.png" alt="AS Graph"></p>

<p>Chinanet is no surprise given the high ratio of China in general.  OVH is a
low-cost host known to have liberal AUP, so is popular for both malicious and
research purposes.  DigitalOcean and Microsoft, of course, are popular cloud
providers.  Surprisingly, AWS only sourced about 600 connections, unless they
have a large number of IPs on a non-Amazon ASN.</p>

<p>Overall, traffic came from 27,448 unique IPv4 addresses.  Of those, more than 11
thousand sent only a single request.  At the other end of the spectrum, the top
IP source sent 64,969 login requests.</p>

<p>Most hosts sent relatively few requests, the large numbers are outliers:</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/ipcnts.png" alt="IP Count Graph"></p>

<p>Surely, by now a thought has crossed your mind: how many of these requests are
coming from Tor?  Surely the Tor network is a wretched hive of scum and villany,
and the source of much malicious traffic, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://systemoverlord.com/img/gopot/tor.png" alt="Tor Graph"></p>

<p>Not at all.  Only 219 of the unique source IPs were identified as Tor exit
nodes, representing only 0.8% of the sources.  On a per-request basis, even a
smaller percentage of requests is seen from Tor exit nodes.</p>

<h2 id="client-software">Client Software</h2>

<p>Remember – this is self-reported by the client application, and just like I can
spoof the server version string, so can clients.  But I still thought it would
be interesting to take a brief look at those.</p>

<p>You know, I didn’t expect that.  <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> as the top
client strings.  (Also not sure what to make of the case difference.)  I wonder
if people are building the PuTTY SSH library into a tool for scanning or
wrapping the binary in some kind of script.</p>

<p>Go, paramiko, and libssh are less surprising, as they’re libraries designed for
integration.  It’s hard to know if the OpenSSH requests are linked into a
scanning tool or just wrapped versions of the SSH client.  At some point in the
future, I might dive more into this and trying to figure out which software uses
which libraries (at least for the publicly-known tools).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I was hoping to find something earth-shattering in this research.  Instead, I
found things that were much as expected – common usernames and passwords,
widespread scanning, large numbers of requests.  One thing’s for sure though:
connect it to the internet and someone’s going to pwn it.</p>

                <p>GitLive 6.0 releases real-time editing to the JetBrains Marketplace after it has been battle-tested by our community of beta users. It has by far been one of the most anticipated features allowing you to open a teammate’s file and start editing it exactly as you would in a Google Doc independently of the IDE you are using. Furthermore, GitLive 6.0 is adding <strong>Azure DevOps cloud</strong> to our family of supported repository hosting services. A full blog post dedicated to each of these major updates will be released shortly. Additional new features of this release include:</p>

<h4 id="privacy-settings">Privacy Settings</h4>
<p>We had a few queries of people wanting more control over what data is shared with their teammates. Our previous ‘incognito’ mode was the first step in that direction by allowing users to hide their current file changes and what they’re working on.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/gitlive-privacy-settings.png" alt="Privacy Settings GitLive"></p>

<p>Our new privacy settings go a few steps further in that regard by giving users more granular control over what info users want to continuously share or prefer to share only when needed, for instance when discussing a piece of unpushed code in a user’s local working copy.</p>

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="inline-diff-view">Inline Diff View</h4>
<p>In JetBrains IDEs clicking a teammate’s file will now open a diff view inline. The diff view updates as your teammate is making changes to the file.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/gitlive-diff-view.png" alt="Life Diff View in JetBrains"></p>

<h4 id="switching-between-repository-hosting-service-accounts">Switching between repository hosting service accounts</h4>

<p>In JetBrains IDEs you can now easily manage which repository hosting accounts are associated with your GitLive user. Use the “+” and “-“ icons under the GitLive tab within the <em>Preferences</em> window to add and remove repository hosting service accounts you are signed in with.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/GitLive-accounts.jpg" alt="Account Settings in JetBrains"></p>

<h4 id="teammates-list-sorted-by-online-status">Teammates list sorted by online status</h4>
<p>Finally, your teammate’s names in the Team View are now sorted by online status. This makes it more convenient for large teams to locate their active teammates and collaborate.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/Sorted-online-status.png" alt="Sorted online status"></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As this is a major version update make sure your whole team upgrades, all team members need to use the same major version of the plugin otherwise you may find some features that do not work correctly.</p>

<h3><span>Abstract – Designing Trajectories Resilient to Missed Thrust Events Using Expected Thrust Fraction</span></h3>
<p><span>With the adoption of efficient low-thrust propulsion methods, the probability of a</span> <a href="https://gereshes.com/2019/09/02/missed-thrust-events-in-deep-space-trajectories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">missed thrust event</a>&nbsp;<span>occurring has become a significant concern for short and long-duration missions. If the missed thrust events take place during a critical portion of the trajectory, the mission can be compromised. Therefore, it is essential to develop trajectories that are resilient to missed thrust events. This paper investigates the use of expected thrust fraction, which embeds the stochastic nature of missed thrust events into a deterministic optimal control problem. The performance of trajectories designed using expected thrust fraction is compared with traditionally designed trajectories to measure changes in resiliency to missed thrust events. In this investigation, trajectories designed using expected thrust fraction arrive with a median lateness half that of traditionally designed trajectories. Using expected thrust fraction can help astrodynamicists mitigate risks posed by the use of low-thrust propulsion.</span></p>

<p>“Competition is for the Losers - Peter Thiel”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost a decade ago, I learnt an important lesson about adverse effect of gamification on team work. We did hit our goal before the deadline but in the hindsight it wasn’t the best outcome in terms of team dynamics. </p>
<p>I was asked to lead an upgrade project. We had 800 issues to fix in ~4 weeks time. Although most of the issues were minor, we had to look through and test each of them.  </p>
<p>Most work items took a few hours but some took a little longer than a day. I decided to create a shared pool, from which each team member will pick the next item after he/she is done with the current at hand. I kept a shared dashboard that showed total issues resolved and no of tasks solved by each member.  </p>
<p>After a couple days, I was surprised to notice a few members converted this process into a battleground.  They were keeping scores.  For a moment, I thought this is going well and we should stick to it. But then, as I reviewed the work, I started noticing the mistakes.  </p>
<p>The reason was clear, the team members were scoring based on just the completion of work and in that hurry the quality started to fall apart. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moral of the story - a shared metric and progress helped the team to get energised but keeping score of each members didn’t. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ill effects of competition are not just limited to workplace but they can be seen at our schools too. </p>
<h4 id="groupism"><a href="#groupism" aria-label="groupism permalink"></a>Groupism</h4>
<p>At a summer camp, a newly appointed sports teacher thought it will be a good idea to split students in red (ruby) and blue(emerald) teams. Each team would compete in multiple games, challenges through out the summer.  </p>
<p>The team assignments in a way mutated the identities of the kids. They started associated themselves as rubysts or emeralds. </p>
<p>Half way through the summer, the teacher started noticing increasing hatred among two groups as they competed as rivals.  This wasn’t the result she was expecting. The idea was rather to make students better team players and respect each other. </p>
<p>A few days went by and an unexpected event, a broken water pipe, gave her with an idea to break the tension.  The pipe delivered water to camp needed to be fixed and this impacted everybody at the camp. Both the groups had to come together to solve the issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common goal brought students to team up and work together. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking a cue from this, the teacher started placing hurdles that required the two teams to work together. For example - teams could only go to a movie if both teams had enough cash to do so. In such instances, teams even started pitching in for other.  </p>
<p>In a few days, the teams started being more friendly to each other and respecting too. Some rubysts even traveled in emerald buses and vice versa.</p>
<p>The key idea here is, presence of a perceived common goal brings people together.</p>
<h4 id="creating-teams-and-department"><a href="#creating-teams-and-department" aria-label="creating teams and department permalink"></a>Creating Teams and Department</h4>
<p>I once worked with startup that grew from 10 to tripple digits in a matter of months. During this time, I have seen teams forming up. The ‘Us vs them’ chorus growing at the same time. </p>
<p>This typically happens when your go with common tactics of creating departments by nature of work (e.g. sales, marketing, product, etc). </p>
<p>But integration of teams is much more important. One way to achieve that is by sharing a metric. </p>
<p>That’s why a lot of companies are moving towards squads (mix of engineers, design, QA) that share a common goal (e.g. product delivery). I think this is a good direction to head atleast for product-led companies. </p>
<p>When I was defining the team structure at <a href="http://xcelerator.ninja/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xceler</a>, I learnt to put product focused squads instead of technology based split (e.g. backend/API, android, front end). The entire team had a single goal of getting that product in the market.   </p>
<p>This structure however doesn’t account much for building capability or domain expertise. That’s why focused groups for learning initiatives might be necessary. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To summarize, I think teams should be built around a shared metric that enables a common goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="special-badges-dont-help-anyone"><a href="#special-badges-dont-help-anyone" aria-label="special badges dont help anyone permalink"></a>Special badges don’t help anyone</h4>
<p>A common strategy in many companies is to assign badges or titles such as Performer of the Month. The only thing these awards achieve is create a sense competition among the team members.</p>
<p>I also received a few of these in my early years and I don’t think it ever motivated me more than I was.  </p>
<p>Your high performers are (usually) already motivated, get better appraisals, then why add more badges of burden on the rest? </p>
<h4 id="towards-a-cohesive-unit-not-a-competitive-one"><a href="#towards-a-cohesive-unit-not-a-competitive-one" aria-label="towards a cohesive unit not a competitive one permalink"></a>Towards a cohesive unit, not a competitive One</h4>
<p>When working with a team, I think paying attention to these two leads to better team work than not. </p>
<ul>
<li>Identify if your people or reward strategy is not creating competitition inward</li>
<li>If you must compete, then go outward (i.e. outside products, success metrics)</li>
</ul>

            <p>With the recent release of <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">Crusader Kings 3</a> by Paradox Interactive, a new UI paradigm in the game stopped me in my tracks. There are a lot of lessons that web designers can learn from video game user interface design and while they aren’t always transferrable, they are worth exploring. In this case it’s the idea of having <i>tooltips within tooltips.</i></p>

            <p>Tooltips have become a standard component in user interface design. The majority of web UI frameworks include some form of tooltip, with Bootstrap having <i>two</i> types (Tooltips and Popovers). Wikipedia uses tooltips when hovering over links:</p>

People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their face. The transmission may also occur through aerosols that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time in enclosed spaces. It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear, and from people who are asymptomatic.

            <p>Did you find it intuitive? Could you easily traverse up and down the tooltip chain? Note: this is a HTML/CSS example that I quickly put together so it’s rough around the edges.</p>

            <p>I found it suprisingly intuitive and easy to use. When you hover to reveal the first tooltip, you keep your cursor nice and still. After that, you locate a piece of information you want to learn more about and you hover over that. It might overlap the first tooltip, but that’s fine. You’ve chosen to seek more information.</p>

            <p>Another reason I like this idea, is that it matches how I think. When learning something new, there might be a supporting concept or idea I don't fully grasp. A nested tooltip is a great solution.</p>

            <p>In the context of a complex grand strategy game like CK3, having explanatory text is necessary. The designers and developers at Paradox elegantly solved this by implementing tooltips within tooltips. Kudos to them.</p>

            <h3>Potential issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accessibility.</b> Well anything is possible with Javascript right? You could tab through the tooltips to get them working.</li>
                <li><b>User experience.</b> It can be frustrating to move your cursor 1 pixel outside of the bounds of the element which removes the tooltip.</li>
                <li><b>How deep do you go?</b> The designer should use discretion. An infinitely deep tooltip chain doesn't make sense. There might be some sweet number here like, 2 or 3 nested tooltips.</li>
                <li><b>Touch?</b> I'm not sure how mobile works. You could just treat them as tappable elements.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I guess the question is: could the web embrace nested tooltips?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>Hey look! OAuth is getting spiffed up a bit. The original OAuth 2.0 specification was released in October 2012 as <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>. It replaced OAuth 1.0, released in April 2010. There have been some extensions over the years. A new OAuth specification has been proposed and is currently under discussion. As of this blog post’s writing, the specification was most recently updated on March 8, 2020. If approved, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-parecki-oauth-v2-1-01">OAuth 2.1</a> will obsolete certain parts of Oauth 2.0 and mandate additional security best practices. The rest of the OAuth 2.0 specification will be retained.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This post assumes you are a developer or have similar technical experience. It also assumes you are familiar with OAuth and the terms used in the various RFCs. If you’d like an introduction to OAuth and why you’d consider using it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">Wikipedia is a good place to start</a>. This post discusses proposed changes to OAuth that might affect you if you are using OAuth in your application or if you implement the OAuth specification.</p>

<h2 id="why-oauth-21">Why OAuth 2.1?</h2>

<p>It’s been a long time since OAuth 2.0 was released. A consolidation point release was in order. As outlined in a <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/2019/12/12/21/its-time-for-oauth-2-dot-1">blog post</a> by Aaron Parecki, one of the authors of the OAuth 2.1 draft specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My main goal with OAuth 2.1 is to capture the current best practices in OAuth 2.0 as well as its well-established extensions under a single name. That also means specifically that this effort will not define any new behavior itself, it is just to capture behavior defined in other specs. It also won’t include anything considered experimental or still in progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this is not a scrape and rebuild of OAuth 2.0. Instead, OAuth 2.1 consolidates the changes and tweaks to OAuth 2.0 that have been made over the past eight years, with a focus on better default security. It establishes the best practices and will serve as a reference document. Here’s a suggested description pulled from the <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/oauth/Ne4Q9erPP7SpC5051sSy6XnLDv0/">ongoing mailing list discussion</a>: “By design, [OAuth 2.1] does not introduce any new features to what already exists in the OAuth 2.0 specifications being replaced.” Many of the new draft specification details are drawn from the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a> document. However, in the name of security best practices, some of the more problematic grants will be removed.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the goal is to have a single document detailing how to best implement and use OAuth, as both a client and an implementor. No longer will developers have to hunt across multiple RFCs and standards documents to understand how a specified behavior should be implemented or used.</p>

<h2 id="i-use-oauth-in-my-application-what-does-oauth-21-mean-to-me">I use OAuth in my application, what does OAuth 2.1 mean to me?</h2>

<p>Don’t panic.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the discussion process around this specification is ongoing. A draft RFC was posted to the IETF mailing list in mid-March. As of the time of writing, the revision and discussion are still actively occurring.</p>

<p>You may ask, when will it be available? The short answer is “no one knows”.</p>

<p>The long answer is “truly, no one knows. It does seem like we’re early in the process, though.”</p>

<p>Even after OAuth 2.1 is released, it will likely be some time before it is widely implemented. Omitted grants may be supported with warnings forever. The exact changes to the specification are still up in the air, the release of the RFC is even further in the future and when it is released, you can continue to use an OAuth 2.0 server if that serves your needs.</p>

<p>That said, when this is released the biggest impact on people who use OAuth for authentication or authorization in their applications will be planning on how to handle the removed grants: the Implicit grant or Resource Owner Password Credentials grant.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-changing">What is changing?</h2>

<p>The draft RFC has a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-parecki-oauth-v2-1-01#section-12">section</a> outlining the major changes between OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 2.1. There may be other changes not captured there but the goal is to document all formal changes there. There are six such changes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The authorization code grant is extended with the functionality from PKCE (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">RFC7636</a>) such that the only method of using the authorization code grant according to this specification requires the addition of the PKCE mechanism</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Redirect URIs must be compared using exact string matching as per Section 4.1.3 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Implicit grant (“response_type=token”) is omitted from this specification as per Section 2.1.2 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Resource Owner Password Credentials grant is omitted from this specification as per Section 2.4 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bearer token usage omits the use of bearer tokens in the query string of URIs as per Section 4.3.2 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Refresh tokens must either be sender-constrained or one-time use as per Section 4.12.2 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whew, that’s a lot of jargon. We’ll examine each of these in turn. But before we do, let’s define a few terms that will be used in the rest of this post.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>client</code> is a piece of code that the user is interacting with; browsers, native apps or single-page applications are all clients.</li>
  <li>An <code>OAuth server</code> implements OAuth specifications and has or can obtain information about which resources are available to clients–in the RFCs this is called an Authorization Server, but this is also known as an Identity Provider. Most users call it “the place I log in”.</li>
  <li>An <code>application server</code> doesn’t have any authentication functionality but knows how to delegate to an OAuth server. It has a client id which allows the OAuth server to identify it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-authorization-code-grant-and-pkce">The Authorization Code grant and PKCE</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The authorization code grant is extended with the functionality from PKCE (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">RFC7636</a>) such that the only method of using the authorization code grant according to this specification requires the addition of the PKCE mechanism</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow, that’s a mouthful. Let’s break that down. The Authorization Code grant is one of the most common OAuth grants and is the most secure. If flow charts are your jam, here’s <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/authentication/webapp/oauth-authorization-code-grant-sessions">a post explaining the Authorization Code grant</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) RFC</a> was published in 2015 and extends the Authorization Code grant to protect from an attack if part of the authorization flow happens over a non TLS connection. For example, between components of a native application. This attack could also happen if TLS has a vulnerability or if router firmware has been compromised and is spoofing DNS or downgrading from TLS to HTTP. PKCE requires an additional one-time code to be sent to the OAuth server. This is used to validate the request has not been intercepted or modified.</p>

<p>The OAuth 2.1 draft specification requires that the PKCE challenge must be used with every Authorization Code grant, protecting against the authorization code being hijacked by an attacker.</p>

<h3 id="redirect-uris-must-be-compared-using-exact-string-matching">Redirect URIs must be compared using exact string matching</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Redirect URIs must be compared using exact string matching as per Section 4.1.3 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some OAuth grants, notably the Authorization Code grant, use a redirect URI to determine where to send the client after success. For example, here’s a FusionAuth screen where the allowed redirect URIs are configured (it is the “Authorized redirect URLs” setting):</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/whats-new-in-oauth-2-1/admin-application-configuration.png" alt="Application configuration"></p>

<p>In this case, the only allowed value is <code>http://localhost:3000/oauth-callback</code> but you can configure multiple values. The client specifies which one of these the user who is signing in should be redirected to.</p>

<p>Now, it would sure be convenient to support wildcards in this redirect URI list. At FusionAuth, we hear this request from folks who want to simplify their development or CI environments. Every time a new server is spun up, the redirect URI configuration must be updated to include the new URI.</p>

<p>For example, if a CI system builds an application for every feature branch, it might have the hostname <code>dans-sample-application-1551.herokuapp.com</code>, if the feature branch was a fix for bug #1551. If I wanted to login using the Authorization Code grant, I’d have to update the redirect URI settings for my OAuth server to include that specific redirect URI: <code>https://dans-sample-application-1551.herokuapp.com/oauth-callback</code>.</p>

<p>And then when the next feature branch build happened, say for bug #1552, I’d have to add <code>https://dans-sample-application-1552.herokuapp.com/oauth-callback</code> and so on. Obviously, it’d be easier to set the redirect URI to a wildcard value like <code>https://dans-sample-application-*.herokuapp.com/oauth-callback</code>; in an ideal world, any URL matching that pattern would be acceptable to the OAuth server. Of course, if you are using FusionAuth, you can <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/applications#update-an-application">update your application configuration as part of the CI build process</a> as an alternative.</p>

<p>An additional use case for a wild card redirect URI is when the redirect URI needs dynamic parameters useful to the final destination page, like <code>trackingparam=123&amp;specialoffer=abc</code>. These may be appended to the redirect URL before the OAuth process began. A URL with dynamic parameters won’t match any of the configured redirect URIs, and so the redirect fails.</p>

<p>However, allowing such wildcard matching for the redirect URI is a security risk. If the redirect URI matching is flexible, an attacker could redirect a user to an open redirect server controlled by them, and then on to a malicious destination; OWASP further discusses the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html#dangerous-url-redirects">perils of such open redirect servers</a>. While this would require compromising the request in some fashion, using exact matching for redirect URIs eliminates this risk because the redirect URI is always a known value.</p>

<h3 id="the-implicit-grant-is-removed">The Implicit grant is removed</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Implicit grant (“response_type=token”) is omitted from this specification as per Section 2.1.2 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-14">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practices</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Implicit grant is inherently insecure when used in a single-page application (SPA). If you use this grant, your access token is exposed. You’ll get an access token that is …</p></div></div>

                        <p><strong>This summer, a team of researchers, engineers and a drone pilot of TU Delft travelled to an airbase in Germany for the first real test flight of the scaled flight model of the energy-efficient aircraft design called the Flying-V. The project was announced last year together with KLM. After a period of extensive wind tunnel testing and a series of ground tests in the Netherlands, it was time to perform the first flight and obtain an impression of the flight characteristics. The aircraft had a very successful maiden flight.</strong></p><p>Project leader Dr Roelof Vos and his team of researchers and engineers took the 22.5 kg and 3 m wide scale model of the Flying-V for flight tests to a well-guarded airbase in Germany, where they could work together with a team from Airbus. The pilot’s task was to take-off, fly a number of test manoeuvres and approaches until the batteries were nearly empty and land. And he succeeded. Vos: “One of our worries was that the aircraft might have some difficulty lifting-off, since previous calculations had shown that ‘rotation’ could be an issue. The team optimized the scaled flight model to prevent the issue but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You need to fly to know for sure.” Rotation on take-off was performed easily and occurred at a speed of 80 km/h. The plane’s thrust was good and flight speeds and angles were as predicted.</p><p>But testing new technology is never straightforward. The team had a challenging week in which they had to change the centre of gravity of the aircraft and fix the antenna to improve telemetry. The flight has now also confirmed that the current design still shows too much ‘Dutch roll’, causing a slightly rough landing. A next step for the team is to use the data collected during the flight for an aerodynamic (software) model of the aircraft. This will make it possible to programme it in a flight simulator to be used in future research , while further improving the flight characteristics. The team will also prepare the scale model for future flight tests.&nbsp;</p><div id="c651315">

</div><div id="c650988"><p>The Flying-V is a design for a highly energy-efficient long-distance aeroplane. The aircraft’s design integrates the passenger cabin, the cargo hold and the fuel tanks in the wings, creating a spectacular V-shape. Computer calculations have predicted that the aircraft’s improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight will reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to today’s most advanced aircraft. KLM has been a partner in the project since 2019. Also due to their support, the project team has been able to build this scale model. It was first presented at the 100th anniversary of KLM in October 2019. Various business partners are now involved in the project, including Airbus. Airbus is also an explicit supporter for the first flight. The partners are working together on a research plan to fine-tune the concept. Next step: providing the Flying-V with sustainable propulsion, taking into account that the design seems highly suitable to carry liquid hydrogen instead of kerosene. </p></div><div id="c650998"><p><em>Webcast</em>: On 1 September Dr. Roelof Vos and Prof. Henri Werij showed and explained what happened during the test week.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                 <p>Back in 2013, I published <strong>Why you should not use Drupal or Wordpress for your company website</strong> (Czech version only, <a href="https://www.kurzor.net/blog/18-ne-drupalu-a-wordpressu-na-firemni-web" target="_blank">available in the archive</a>). The article has gained popularity amongst our local visitors. Many changes happened in website development since its publication, therefore it's a good idea to revisit the article.</p>
<p>To make sure that we understand the topic, let me explain the commonly used shortcut. CMS means Content Management System and it is a solution that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>will allow you to create, edit and organize content on your website (most often online, via some administrative interface),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>composes the website itself from the content you provided.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The world has changed a lot since 2013 and as such has had the web ecosystems. This led me to revisit the topic, taking the perspective of a company manager whose task it is to create a new website for his company.</p>
<p>Let's start with some questions.</p>
<h2>What should you ask before choosing</h2>
<p><strong>How much money should I invest in the website?</strong></p>
<p>Money. That factor is the ultimate and decisive argument when thinking about any development. You can't have a top-level website if you can't afford it. So you should start by writing down a possible budget.</p>
<p>What I learned is that by far many people think website costs are only about the technical part - preparing and powering it up. But this is hazardous. The golden rule of the best value for the money should be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose the minimum viable CMS solution and invest the rest of your money into promotion and content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the most important part. It does not matter how technically good your website is if nobody can't find it. It's critical to make sure you have enough visitors to start with, and that they don't leave because your website content sucks. Always select a viable goal such as the number of conversions / purchases and do everything in your power to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>The rest of this article should help you choose your minimally viable solution from what is available today. For that to succeed, start by writing down some points:</p>
<p><strong>What functionality do I require?</strong></p>
<p>Do you have any specific tasks in mind for the website apart from presenting just content like text, images and videos?</p>
<p>Should it contain purchasing options, and into what depth? Are you selling one product with 4 options or 400 products? Would you need to handle inventory, accounting and other features of e-commerce as well?</p>
<p>Is your website supposed to be connected to some other systems of yours or a third-party provider?</p>
<p>Do you have some interactive parts for your visitors, such as quizzes, games, seminars, anything unusual?</p>
<p>And for each of the points you come up with, you should ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the motivation for this?
How important is it for me?
Is there any other way to do it other than including it on the website?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason is that any of these parts might require additional development. Or worse, it might need a more complex CMS. Both ways, if it's not thought out well before the start, your costs might skyrocket.</p>
<p><strong>What is my expected traffic?</strong></p>
<p>Another important point. Do you expect to start small, with just a few unique visits daily, or do you immediately foresee to be attracting thousands of visitors?</p>
<p>People often expect their website to handle any amount of traffic at any given time, but that is, in fact, a complex technical issue. Choosing a bad CMS and hosting combination with a very large visitor influx might bring your whole website down very quickly, and your reputation is damaged from the start. Performance, meaning how quickly your site loads and renders content, is the key here.</p>
<p><strong>How quickly do I need it?</strong></p>
<p>This is also an important factor. It translates into a simple law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quality of a product is tightly related to the time required to develop it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more time you can invest before you launch the website, the more options are there to choose from. And of course, nobody is working longer hours for less money, so...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time equals money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This looks very dull and obvious, but it actually leads to a very important decision you need to ask at the start of your website development cycle:</p>
<p><strong>Custom design or ready-to-use template?</strong></p>
<p>Do you know the difference and benefits? Once you have agreed on the time &amp; cost you should take your time to consider them and make your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Ready-to-use templates</strong>  or <strong>themes</strong>  are properties of some CMS to lower the initial cost a lot. Requiring typically just a small purchase and some time spent on populating the content, it has its merits for some scenarios. You cannot depend on them too heavily, though.</p>
<p>One disadvantage is that modification of themes is possible only to some extent. Demo sites usually show all of the features and if you need something outside of this realm, you might need expensive and complicated developer intrusions.</p>
<p>There will also be performance issues. Themes try to accommodate as many options as possible and that often leads to bloated designs with poor page load speeds.</p>
<p>And lastly, forget about any uniqueness. Thousands of websites might reuse the same theme as you do. And the best selling themes are the most generic ones, to appease the largest crowd.</p>
<figure>
        <img src="https://www.kurzor.net/var/assets/template_images/blog/wordpress-pimcore-or-gatsby/themes-themeforest.jpg" alt="Themes Themeforest" title="Themes Themeforest">
        <figcaption><i> <em>Figure 1.: Try</em> <a href="https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress?sort=sales" target="_blank"><em>Themeforest</em></a> <em>to get some idea what themes look like. Around 12k themes for Wordpress, costs averaging around $50.</em> </i></figcaption>
    </figure>
<p><strong>Custom design</strong>  is always the more expensive option. It usually has two steps: <em>Graphics design</em>, where your website layout is designed by a professional, and <em>coding phase</em>, which is the conversion of the design into the CMS of choice. And that also requires a professional, the one titled <em>front-end developer</em>  (sometimes <em>web coder</em>).</p>
<p>The main disadvantage is thus cost and time. Advantages, on the other hand, are serious to make this option considerable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is possible to design whatever you want, meaning some unique parts of your site can be accommodated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a good front-end developer you are able to obtain unmatched results in site performance, cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provided you have a good choice of the designer, your website will be more appealing and uniquely branded to fit your visual identity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With questions asked and answers written down, let's dive deep into the selection that is on the market today.</p>
<h2>First option: Classic Open-Source CMS</h2>
<p>First, we will explore CMS that can be downloaded and installed on your web server. Let's call them "classic". There are a few notes that you should be aware of.</p>
<p>At first, you need some hosting with an appropriate web server to set up your site. This is different for the various systems. Currently, it is possible to find optimized hosting plans for every major CMS. That usually trades higher cost for additional benefits, such as faster setup time, better CMS performance and fewer security issues.</p>
<p>Secondly, this type of CMS usually requires some developer or specialist to set up the website as you require. More peculiar systems will – in general – demand more skilled labour.</p>
<p>Thirdly, all these systems offer an administration interface directly via the website you will be creating. Which makes editorial work simple, but can be a security problem if not treated professionally.</p>
<h3><em>Important Note: Open-Source or Proprietary?</em></h3>
<p>Originally in 2013, I leaned towards a tailor-made CMS solution, pointing to our own 3OS system as a good candidate for the company website. Today, after gaining additional knowledge and experience, my stance is very different and I prefer Open-source systems.</p>
<p>You might ask, why? Is it about the cost of the license?</p>
<p>Actually, no. The argument is simple: Open-source CMS have matured, the selection is huge and the advantages of using them seriously outweigh the commercial/custom/proprietary bunch:</p>
<ul>
<li>their real-world usage is different orders of magnitude higher,</li>
<li>this results in the large development community and frequent updates,</li>
<li>they also have a whole ecosystem of ready-to-use themes and various plugins,</li>
<li>they are popular amongst developers, hence the risk of vendor lock-in is lower.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is also what happened to us since 2013: although the 3OS system we developed at Kurzor was a good choice for clients considering cost, quality and ease of use, it was simply unsustainable to continue its further development and keep the pace with other evolving Open-source solutions. So we now prefer Open-source CMS solutions for new projects, most usual choices being Wordpress, Pimcore or Gatsby.</p>
<p>That explained, let's move further and inspect the market as of today.</p>
<p>There is one system which we cannot afford to not list in there. Guess which one.</p>
<h3>Wordpress: The big name in the game</h3>
<p>Any serious conversation about CMS for a company website must start with Wordpress. Its coverage is by far the largest and there is nothing that can be done about it in the near future.</p>
<p>Wordpress is a great example of a matured system. It is reliable and has many great features you can directly use, such as an excellent visual-based editor, an understandable system for posts and articles, media management and many more.</p>

<p>While perfectly suitable for sites with all degrees of complexity, there are some specifics of using Wordpress as your CMS of choice.</p>
<p>First of all, Wordpress is <strong>primarily a "blogging" solution</strong>. It might need the help of a few plugins to enhance it to expected levels of a typical company website. Some of them require a commercial license, making it harder to perform upgrades in the long run.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, you need an external plugin like to handle multilingual content <a href="https://wpml.org/" target="_blank">the excellent WPML</a>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or you want the power of a tool like <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank">Advanced Custom Fields</a> to define content entities and their relations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With Wordpress, you can do <strong>both design options</strong>, with ready-to-use themes being in the large and affordable spectrum, and custom design having no …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
  
  <p><span>05 Sep 2020</span></p><p>Suppose we have the functions</p>

<div><div><pre><code>float f( float x )
{
    return x * 2.0f + 1.0f;
}

float g( float x, float y )
{
    return f( x ) * 0.3f + f( y ) * 0.7f;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and we need to apply <code>g</code> to the two arrays <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
storing the result in the array <code>z</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void h( float const * x, float const * y, float * z, std::size_t n )
{
    for( std::size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i )
    {
        z[ i ] = g( x[ i ], y[ i ] );
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nowadays, all major compilers
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/q148se">automatically vectorize</a>
this code and generate SIMD instructions for it – at most,
we need to pass <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/c71vo5">-O3</a> instead
of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/63hqG4">-O2</a> to GCC. But let’s
suppose, for the sake of discussion, that it’s 2008, the
compilers don’t autovectorize, and we still want to employ SIMD.</p>

<p>One elegant technique that allows us to keep our functions
mostly unchanged is to convert them to templates:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt; T f( T x )
{
    return x * 2.0f + 1.0f;
}

template&lt;class T&gt; T g( T x, T y )
{
    return f( x ) * 0.3f + f( y ) * 0.7f;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This still lets us call them with <code>float</code> as before, but
it also enables us calling them with a
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Vector-Extensions.html">SIMD pack of four floats</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>using m128 = __attribute__(( vector_size( 4*sizeof(float) ) )) float;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>so that we can now rewrite <code>h</code> to
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Y8xqd9">work at four elements at a time</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void h( float const * x, float const * y, float * z, std::size_t n )
{
    std::size_t i = 0;

    for( ; i + 3 &lt; n; i += 4 )
    {
        m128 xi;
        std::memcpy( &amp;xi, x + i, sizeof( m128 ) );

        m128 yi;
        std::memcpy( &amp;yi, y + i, sizeof( m128 ) );

        m128 zi = g( xi, yi );

        std::memcpy( z + i, &amp;zi, sizeof( m128 ) );
    }

    for( ; i &lt; n; ++i )
    {
        z[ i ] = g( x[ i ], y[ i ] );
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>OK, but what’s the point of all this in 2020?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that templatizing our functions enables more
than vectorization. We can pass other things to them. In particular,
we can define a type that instead of doing calculations when operators
such as <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> are applied to it, builds an abstract syntax tree
instead.</p>

<p>This means that when we call <code>g</code> with this type, instead of the value
<code>g(x)</code> at some point <code>x</code>, we can get a symbolic representation of the body
of <code>g</code>.</p>

<p>To illustrate that, I will define a simple type <code>Q</code> that for reasons of
brevity will build a string representation of the function body, instead
of a proper syntax tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct Q
{
    std::string s_;

    Q( std::string const &amp; s ): s_( s ) {}
    Q( float x ): s_( std::to_string( x ) ) {}
};

Q operator+( Q const&amp; q1, Q const&amp; q2 )
{
    return { "(" + q1.s_ + " + " + q2.s_ + ")" };
}

Q operator*( Q const&amp; q1, Q const&amp; q2 )
{
    return { "(" + q1.s_ + " * " + q2.s_ + ")" };
}

std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;( std::ostream&amp; os, Q const&amp; q )
{
    return os &lt;&lt; q.s_;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, when I pass this type to our function <code>g</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    std::cout &lt;&lt; g( Q{"x"}, Q{"y"} ) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jonEWT">get</a></p>

<div><div><pre><code>((((x * 2.000000) + 1.000000) * 0.300000) + (((y * 2.000000) + 1.000000) * 0.700000))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is exactly what <code>g</code> does.</p>

</div>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>07 Sep 2020</span></p><p>A programming language supports <em>named parameters</em> when one
can call a function supplying the parameters by name, as in
the following hypothetical example (using C++ syntax):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void f( int x, int y );

int main()
{
    f( x = 1, y = 2 );
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C++ is obviously not such a language and there have been
numerous proposals to rectify this omission, unfortunately none
of them successful. The latest attempt is Axel Naumann’s paper
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0671r2.html">Self-explanatory Function Arguments</a>,
which tries to attack the problem from another angle by just
allowing normal function calls to be tagged with the parameter
name, as in</p>



<p>enabling compilers to issue helpful warnings when a name doesn’t
match, but not allowing one to omit, or reorder, arguments.</p>

<p>Even in this limited form, named parameters would still be immensely
useful, but this is not what this post is about. What this post is
about is that we can already achieve something very close to named
parameters in C++20, by using a C99 feature called <em>designated
initializers</em>.</p>

<p>Designated initializers allow one to initialize structures by
member name, as in the following example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A
{
    int x;
    int y;
};

A a1 = { .x = 1, .y = 2 };
A a2 = { .x = 3 }; // a2.y == 0
A a3 = { .y = 4 }; // a3.x == 0
A a4 = { .y = 5, .x = 6 }; // valid C, invalid C++ (reorder)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>C++ introduces a restriction C doesn’t have: the initializers
must follow the declaration order, similarly to how class member
initalizers are executed in member declaration order. But in
exchange, it allows us to supply default values:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A
{
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
};

A a3 = { .y = 4 }; // a3.x == 0, no warning
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can already see where this is going. Instead of</p>



<p>we declare</p>



<p>and then call it like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>int main()
{
    f({ .x = 1, .y = 2 });
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This works under <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/YfWj3W">GCC</a> and
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/vbnz4T">Clang</a> even without <code>-std=c++20</code> because
they support designated initializers in earlier language modes as
an extension, and it works under <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/bKozaW">MSVC</a>
with <code>-std:c++latest</code>.</p>

<p>For a more realistic example, consider this snippet, taken from real
code, that sets a 10 second
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/beast/doc/html/beast/using_websocket/timeouts.html">timeout</a>
on a <a href="https://boost.org/libs/beast">Boost.Beast</a> websocket:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;boost/beast/websocket/stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/beast/core/tcp_stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

void f1(boost::beast::websocket::stream&lt;boost::beast::tcp_stream&gt;&amp; ws)
{
    auto opt = boost::beast::websocket::stream_base::timeout();

    opt.keep_alive_pings = true;
    opt.idle_timeout = std::chrono::seconds(10);

    ws.set_option(opt);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how we can reformulate it by using the above idiom and <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code>
literals:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;boost/beast/websocket/stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/beast/core/tcp_stream.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;chrono&gt;

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

void f2(boost::beast::websocket::stream&lt;boost::beast::tcp_stream&gt;&amp; ws)
{
    ws.set_option({ .idle_timeout = 10s, .keep_alive_pings = true });
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from the slightly awkward <code>({ ... })</code> syntax and the need to observe
the right parameter order, that’s not that far from the ideal; and it’s
considerably better than <code>f1</code>.</p>

<p>This also works for constructors. Consider this hypothetical <code>vector</code> class
that is like <code>std::vector</code>, except with its various constructor overloads
replaced with one taking named parameters:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>template&lt;class T, class A = std::allocator&lt;T&gt;&gt; class vector
{
private:

    struct params
    {
        std::size_t size = 0;
        T element{};
        std::size_t capacity = 0;
        A allocator{};
    };

public:

    explicit vector( params p );
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/x17fdY">how it’s used</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>auto f()
{
    vector&lt;int&gt; v{{ .size = 4, .element = 11, .capacity = 64 }};
    return v;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Again, apart from the odd <code>{{ ... }}</code> syntax, not that bad.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>There are many ways to manage a WordPress application. Fortunately, it is possible to use Composer with WordPress.</p><p>In this article, we will show how to <strong>use Composer with WordPress</strong>, so that you can easily <strong>maintain</strong> it, <strong>manage</strong> it and <strong>deploy</strong> it in different server environments.</p><p>That means that you will be able to <strong>install WordPress core, themes, plugins</strong> etc. as well as update and delete them when needed via Composer.</p><p>To achieve this, we will use the following tools:</p><ul><li><a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> - for managing packages</li><li><a href="https://wpackagist.org/">WPackagist</a> - repository for WordPress plugins and themes</li><li><a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/envoy">Laravel Envoy</a> - for writing easy deployment scripts</li></ul><hr><h2 id="using-composer-with-wordpress">Using Composer with WordPress</h2><p>Our first goal is to <strong>download the WordPress core, the plugins and themes as versioned Composer dependencies</strong>.</p><p>So in order to <strong>use Composer with WordPress</strong>, we will first install Composer and then create a <code>composer.json</code> file in the root directory of our project:</p><pre><code>{
    "repositories":[
        {
            "type":"composer",
            "url":"https://wpackagist.org"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre><p>Since Composer uses <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist</a> by default as a package repository, we will need to tell Composer that we will need <a>WPackagist</a> instead.</p><p>Now we would be able to <strong>install public WordPress plugins and themes as Composer dependencies</strong>, for example like this:</p><pre><code>{
    "require": {
        "wpackagist-plugin/akismet":"^4.1",
        "wpackagist-theme/twentytwenty":"*"
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Next, let's <strong>install the WordPress core via Composer</strong>. We will be using <a href="https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress">John P Bloch's mirror of WordPress Core</a> to achieve that:</p><pre><code>{
	"require": {
	        "johnpbloch/wordpress": "&gt;=5.4"
	},
	"extra": {
	        "installer-paths": {
	            "wp-content/plugins/{$name}/": [
	                "type:wordpress-plugin"
	            ],
	            "wp-content/themes/{$name}/": [
	                "type:wordpress-theme"
	            ]
	        },
	        "wordpress-install-dir": "wordpress"
	},
	"repositories": [
	        {
	            "type": "composer",
	            "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
	        }
	]
}       
</code></pre><p>In the <code>require</code> section, we added the dependency. Next, in the <code>extra</code> section, we told <strong>Composer where to look for themes and plugins</strong>. Lastly, we defined the WordPress installation directory to be <code>wordpress</code>.</p><p>Now we can run the following command:</p><pre><code>composer install --prefer-dist
</code></pre><p>Composer will now install WordPress within the <code>wordpress</code> directory in the root of our project.</p><p>To be able to <strong>fully manage WordPress with Composer</strong>, we need to use a different directory for <code>wp-content</code> instead of the default one, <code>wordpress/wp-content</code>.</p><p>Let's create a new directory in the project's root, called <code>wp-content</code>.</p><p>Let's go ahead and create the standard <code>wp-config.php</code> file and then add the following code:</p><pre><code>$domain = 'mydomain.test';

define('WP_SITEURL', "{$domain}/wordpress");
define('WP_HOME',"http:{$domain}");

$httpHost =  isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) ? $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] : $domain;

define( 'WP_CONTENT_DIR', dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wp-content' );
define( 'WP_CONTENT_URL', 'http://' . $httpHost . '/wp-content' );

/** Absolute path to the WordPress directory. */
if ( !defined('ABSPATH') ) {
    define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__) . '/wordpress');
}

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');
</code></pre><p>Next, let's create an <code>index.php</code> file within our project's root directory:</p><pre><code>&lt;?php 
define('WP_USE_THEMES', true);
require( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wordpress/wp-blog-header.php' );
</code></pre><p>Since the <code>wp-config.php</code> file contains sensitive data, we will not commit it to our repository by creating a <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p><pre><code>/wp-config.php
/wordpress/
/wp-content/
/vendor/
</code></pre><p>The <code>wordpress</code>, <code>wp-content</code> and <code>vendor</code> directories also need to be ignored, so we will add them to the <code>.gitignore</code> file as well.</p><p>Now we end up with a very simple project structure:</p><pre><code>/
├── composer.json
├── composer.lock
├── wp-config.php
├── wp-content/
├── wordpress/
├── vendor/
└── .gitignore</code></pre><hr><h3 id="using-composer-to-install-wordpress-plugins-and-themes-from-private-repositories">Using composer to install WordPress plugins and themes from private repositories</h3><p>You may want to install plugins or themes that are hosted in <strong>private repositories</strong> on <strong>Github, Bitbucket</strong> or somewhere else, but not on WPackagist.<br>That is possible, but there are two things you need to do:</p><ol><li>provide your credentials in an <code>auth.json</code> file</li><li>within the <code>composer.json</code>, in the <code>repositories</code> section, you need to tell Composer where to look for the repository:</li></ol><pre><code>{
  "type": "vcs",
  "url": "https://bitbucket.org/your-company/your-theme.git"
}
</code></pre><hr><h2 id="using-envoy-to-deploy-wordpress-with-composer">Using Envoy to deploy WordPress with Composer</h2><p>Now that we have our WordPress project set up with Composer, let's see how to deploy it.</p><p>As we mentioned previously, we will be using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/master/envoy">Laravel Envoy</a> to <strong>write a deployment script for WordPress</strong>.</p><p>The reason why we are using Envoy is because of simplicity. You can also decide to use a different tool like <a href="https://deployer.org/">Deployer</a>.</p><p>Let's go ahead and download Envoy.</p><p>With the deployment script, we can <strong>deploy our WordPress application to different servers</strong>: development, staging and production.</p><p>Because the project structure is so lightweight, now it will be easy to write the deployment steps.</p><p>Here is what our <strong>deployment script for WordPress</strong> will look do:</p><ol><li>Create a new release with a timestamp in a <code>releases</code> directory on your server</li><li>Clone the repository</li><li>Install all the dependencies</li><li>Copy <code>wp-config</code>, <code>.htaccess</code> and other files specific to the server environment (e.g production)</li><li>Create a symlink of the <code>uploads</code> directory to the new release</li><li>Create a symlink of the new release to the domain's document root directory on the server</li><li>Clean up old releases from the server.</li></ol><p>First, let's go to our server and set up a directory called <code>current</code> as the domain document root directory on the server.</p><p>If you are not familiar that, you can follow a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-move-an-apache-web-root-to-a-new-location-on-ubuntu-16-04">tutorial</a> on how to do it.</p><p>You can create the following directory structure on your server: <code>~/sites/yoursite</code></p><p>Now, let's install Envoy with the following command:</p><pre><code>composer global require laravel/envoy
</code></pre><p>Next, let's write the <strong>deployment script for WP</strong>. Let's create a new file in our project root directory called <code>Envoy.blade.php</code>.</p><p>In Envoy, we will use the following directives: <code>@servers</code>, <code>@setup</code>, <code>@task</code> and <code>@story</code>. It's very straightforward, here is what they mean:</p><ul><li><code>@servers</code> - this is where you define all your servers with their corresponding IPs.</li><li><code>@setup</code> - section where you can define variables or configurations.</li><li><code>@task</code> - a single action that should be executed on the specified server.</li><li><code>@story</code> - a sequence of tasks that need to be executed on the specified server.</li></ul><p>The way Envoy works is, it will ssh to the specified servers and execute the defined script, by following the directives.</p><p>Inside the directives you can use PHP to define which UNIX commands need to be executed on the servers.</p><p>The first step will be to define multiple server environments:</p><pre><code>@servers(['local' =&gt; '127.0.0.1', 'staging' =&gt; 'w.x.y.z' 'production' =&gt; ['a.b.c.d']])
</code></pre><p>Next, let's define some variables for our setup steps. These are the things we can configure, depending on our needs.</p><p>In our case, we will assume we have a private repository on Bitbucket for the project.</p><p>The deployment script will clone the master branch and set up the releases directory structure, as discussed above.</p><pre><code>@setup

    // the repository to clone
    $repo = '<a href="https://time2hack.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="53343a2713313a273126303836277d3c2134">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>:your-company/your-wp-composer-project.git';

    // the branch to clone
    $branch = 'master';

    // set up timezones
    date_default_timezone_set('Europe/Berlin');
    
    // we want the releases to be timestamps to ensure uniqueness
    $date = date('YmdHis');

    // the application directory on your server
    $appDir = '~/sites/yoursite';

    // this is where the releases will be stored
    $buildsDir = $appDir . '/releases';

    // this is where the deployment will be
    $deploymentDir = $buildsDir . '/' . $date;

    // and this is the document root directory
    $serve = $appDir . '/current';
    
@endsetup</code></pre><p>Next, let's create a task to actually create the directory for the new release:</p><pre><code>@task('dir')
    echo "Preparing new deployment directory..."
    
    cd {{ $buildsDir }}
    mkdir {{ $date }}
    
    echo "Preparing new deployment directory complete."
@endtask
</code></pre><p>As you can see, it's using Blade syntax for the UNIX commands, with the variables we defined in <code>@setup</code>.</p><p>The following task will clone the repository and the specified branch:</p><pre><code>@task('git')
    echo "Cloning repository..."
    
    cd {{ $deploymentDir }}
    git clone --depth 1 -b {{ $branch }} "{{ $repo }}" {{ $deploymentDir }}

    echo "Cloning repository complete."
@endtask
</code></pre><p>Of course, you will need to make sure your server can access the git repository.</p><p>The next task, will install the dependencies and copy the <code>wp-config.php</code> file:</p><pre><code>@task('install')
    echo "Installing dependencies...";

    composer install --prefer-dist
    cp ../../wp-config.php ./wp-config.php
    
    echo "Installing dependencies complete."
@endtask
</code></pre><p>The next task will create the symlinks to the new release and to the <code>uploads</code> directory:</p><pre><code>@task('live')
    echo "Creating symlinks for the live version..."
    
    cd {{ $deploymentDir }}
    ln -nfs {{ $deploymentDir }} {{ $serve }}
    ln -nfs {{ $appDir }}/uploads {{ $serve }}/wp-content/
    
    echo "Creating symlinks completed."
@endtask
</code></pre><p>The last task will perform a cleanup and delete old releases:</p><pre><code>@task('deployment_cleanup')
    echo "Cleaning up old deployments..."
	
    cd {{ $buildsDir }}
    ls -t | tail -n +4 | xargs rm -rf
    
	echo "Cleaned up old deployments."
@endtask
</code></pre><p>We can configure the number of old releases we want to keep on the server. In our case it is 4.</p><p>Now let's write a <code>@story</code> directive where we can group the tasks we just wrote:</p><pre><code>@story('deploy-staging', ['on' =&gt; 'staging'])
    dir
    git
    install
    live
    deployment_cleanup
@endstory
</code></pre><pre><code>@story('deploy-production', ['on' =&gt; 'production'])
    dir
    git
    install
    live
    deployment_cleanup
@endstory
</code></pre><p>As you can see, we used the names of the tasks inside the <code>@story</code> to define the order of execution.</p><p>Finally, we would be able to run the following <strong>commands to deploy our WordPress to the server</strong>:</p><pre><code>envoy run deploy-staging
</code></pre><p>and</p><pre><code>en…</code></pre></section></div>

<p>I used OLEVBA.py to extract the VBA code but it was giving error. I used <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/" target="_blank">oledump.py</a> tools to analyze the file.</p>



<p>  Using oledum.py. I ran the below command to get the complete document streams. </p>

<p>You can see M at Number 18 and 19 which is the VBA macro as explained by the author of this python script <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/" target="_blank">Didier Stevens</a> M denotes VBA macros. </p>



<p>So the next command I am running</p>



<pre>&gt;&gt;oledump.py -s 18 &lt;filename&gt;</pre>



<p>In below screenshot, it can be seen, the module <strong>Lev1daeyfvl</strong> calling <strong>S_gil0c35zh248.Mei497ecvshp </strong>on Document_Open()</p>

<p>I opened word document, and navigate to VBA developer tool (Alt + F11). I saw the VBA code will execute on form execution.  </p>

<p>Next I debug the code and analyse the behavior.</p>



<p>The PowerShell script is executed by the WMI process by executing VBA code on document open. </p>

<p>I have extracted the PowerShell script which is encoded in base64. by adding a code to copy PowerShell script in text file. Below is the code to extract the PowerShell script. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
    <div>
      
      <div id="ifu-css-colorizable-svgs-examples">
  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Coloring Individual Icons</h2>
      <p>When displaying the same colorizable SVG multiple times, each time a different set of colors can be applied with CSS. Below, the same "hipster" SVG is displayed four times, with different colors for skin, hair, glasses and shirt. The shading is done automatically by the SVG.</p>
      <p>Each of the icons has a unique id, so a CSS id selector can be used to apply the specific colors for each icon.</p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Coloring Groups of Icons</h2>
      <p>Groups of icons can share the same color scheme, and a group of icons can be displayed multiple times with different color schemes. Below, both company info cards show the same set of colorizable SVGs. A CSS color scheme to match the
        corporate identity is applied on each side.</p>
      <p>For coloring groups of icons a CSS class selector is used. This way each icon with class <code>green-company</code> has a different color scheme than
        an icon with class <code>blue-company</code></p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Dynamic Color Changing</h2>
      <p>Colors can be changed dynamically while the icons are displayed. Click on the toggle button below to switch between light and dark mode. The color scheme of the icons will change depending on the selected mode.</p>
      <p>The gradient on the icons is defined by three color values. If the switch is toggled, the class <code>dark-mode</code> is set to the documents's body.
        This will activate a "dark-mode" CSS rule which overrides the default color with a dark mode color.</p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Mouse Interaction and Dynamic Color Changing</h2>
      <p>In this example we use a button state for changing icon colors. Move the mouse over the icons and press and click on them to trigger the color changes.</p>
      <p>The SVG is placed on a button, so we can use the buttons's pseudo class selectors (<code>:hover</code>, <code>:active</code>, and <code>:disabled</code>) to specify different colors.</p>
    </div>
    


  </div>

  <div>
    <div>
      <h2>Text Color as Icon Color</h2>
      <p>When exporting icons as CSS styleable SVGs, you can optionally set the icons' main color as the "free color". For this color the value of current CSS text color will be used.</p>
      <p>Clicking on a color swatch below will set the <code>color</code> attribute of the icons array to the background color of the color swatch. The icons will inherit the color and change accordingly.</p>
    </div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve written already a little about automatic differentiation with Jax
to compute <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/python/2020/01/28/jax-hessian.html">the Hessian</a> and to
run Conway’s <a href="http://www.bnikolic.co.uk/python/jax/2020/04/19/game-of-life-jax.html">game of life accelerators</a> (GPUs).</p>

<p>While computing the Jacobian and Hessian matrices is often used in as
in intermediate step optimisation algorithms, they are occasionally
practically useful in their own right. One such example is the
Black-Scholes model where the Jacobian of the present value of a
derivative (the “Greeks”) is used to hedge against market
movements. Here is a little illustration of computing the Greeks very
easily using Jax.</p>

<p>I’m also using Sam Schoenholz’s
<a href="https://twitter.com/sschoenholz/status/1297933277735469057">jax2tex</a>
(code at
<a href="https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/jax2tex">https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/jax2tex</a>

<p>The starting point is the analytic Black-Scholes model <a href="#black1973pricing">(Black &amp; Scholes, 1973)</a>. I’ve expressed it in terms of the Black 1976

<p>Note the call/put switch is the first parameter so that the call and

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The model can now be directly evaluated:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>BlackScholesCall</span><span>(</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>0.01</span><span>,</span> <span>0.05</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>returns a value of around 2.52.</p>

<p>With a bit of extension of jax2tex we can also print the symbolic
version of the model:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>jax2tex</span><span>.</span><span>op2tex</span><span>[</span><span>jax</span><span>.</span><span>lax</span><span>.</span><span>erf_p</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>f</span><span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>mathrm{ {Erf}}</span><span>\\</span><span>left[{x}</span><span>\\</span><span>right]"</span>
<span>jax2tex</span><span>.</span><span>op2ind</span><span>[</span><span>jax</span><span>.</span><span>lax</span><span>.</span><span>erf_p</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>jax2tex</span><span>.</span><span>noop2ind</span>

<span>jax2tex</span><span>.</span><span>jax2tex</span><span>(</span><span>BlackScholesCall</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>0.01</span><span>,</span> <span>0.05</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We get the following:</p>





<p>With Jax’s automatic differentiation using the <code>grad</code> function we
can obtain the greeks trivially:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Delta</span><span>,</span> <span>Rho</span><span>,</span> <span>Vega</span><span>,</span> <span>mTheta</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>BlackScholesCall</span><span>,</span> <span>argnums</span><span>=</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>x</span> <span>in</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(NB. Theta is negative of the conventional form hence the “m” prefix).
For example we can evaluate delta simply as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Delta</span><span>(</span> <span>100.</span><span>,</span> <span>100.</span><span>,</span> <span>0.01</span><span>,</span> <span>0.05</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Very easy and much reduced possibility for user-introduced errors!</p>

<p>It is possible to also display the symbolic form of the Greeks. It
should be noted these are computed using the reverse-mode
differentiation and will not necessarily have the simplest analytic
form, but can still be useful for spotting potential issues:</p>









<p>Automatic differentiation much reduces the coding (and analysis)
requirement when derivatives are needed. This is true both when they
are used for optimisation but also in their own right. Jax makes
automatic differentiation as easy as a single function call on a
Numpy-like function.</p>

<p>The other major advantage of Jax is  acceleration – more on that in a
forthcoming post!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Famous physicist Murray Gell-Mann is supposed to have <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm" target="_blank">suggested</a> that Richard Feynman solved problems with the following cutting edge technique:</p><blockquote><ol><li>Write down the problem.</li><li>Think real hard.</li><li>Write down the solution.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Usually when people quote this, it’s to make a joke about how smart Feynman was. (If I tried this, I wouldn’t come up with quantum electrodynamics! I must not be able to think hard enough.) That’s one reading, but I prefer a different one.</p><p>When I started programming professionally, I was really excited about figuring out how to become a better programmer. (I still am!) So I asked a lot of people, “how can I become a better programmer?” But nobody gave me very satisfactory answers. They would tell me to play around with obscure programming languages, or study algorithms, or read papers, or do a bunch of other stuff that felt tangential and didn’t really move the needle.</p><p>In retrospect, I wish those people had just told me “think real hard.” I was looking for an easy way out—One Weird Trick to Programming Better—but programming is too hard for that.</p><p>That’s my preferred reading of the Feynman Algorithm: there is no one weird trick.</p><p>On the other hand, I <em>have</em> gotten a ton better at programming in the last four years. Not through any specific piece of advice, or any weird trick. Rather, it’s come by constantly trying to learn small new things, make small tool improvements, make my models a little deeper, work a little faster, come up with slightly better ideas. By, literally, thinking real hard, for a long, long time. The Feynman Algorithm works!</p><p>(That’s not to say good advice is impossible. I’m sure if <a href="http://www.informatika.bg/jeffdean" target="_blank">Jeff Dean</a> watched me go through my programming day, he would have tons of great tactical tips that would help me a lot. But even that depends on Jeff Dean being able to know which of his 10,000 tactical tips would be most useful to me. And the real difference between us isn’t the tactical tips, it’s the underlying models that generate the tips in the first place. Those seem to be nearly impossible to communicate.)</p><p>A lot of the things people ask for advice on fall into this category. “How can I be happier?” “How can I be more productive?” “How can I have a bigger impact on the world?” Sure, there are basic life hacks like sleeping well or getting exercise. But 99% of the “secret”—the thing that separates me from Gell-Mann, or Jeff Dean—is tacit knowledge. It often can’t be articulated any better than “think real hard.” But, believe it or not, thinking real hard, for real long, <em>does</em> work.</p></article></div>]]>

    </span></p><p>From July 14 to August 17, 2020 (at time of publish), I experienced targeted harassment on GitHub—the company I'm employed at—via coordination happening on several "technology" 4chan threads about me. I wanted to share this story publicly to reiterate the bullshit marginalized folks in tech have to go through in order to be successful, visible, and just <em>exist</em>.</p><p>So as the dude in the screenshot says, I have plenty of material to write a post on <em>all that fuckery</em>.</p><p><span role="img" aria-label="wavy dash">〰️</span></p><p>The first round of trolling occurred in issues and PRs on <a href="https://github.com/katmeister/tokyo-2019">one of my repositories</a> that documents the food I ate with my friends on our spring Tokyo 2019 trip. It was only slightly concerning at first, until I realized that 40+ people were posting, commenting, and emoji reacting.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p><undefined>Here are a few examples. The most irritating ones used tech jargon ("fixing bloat") to mask their pathetic actions. As a bystander, you might not realize until viewing the proposed changes... and seeing all content deleted. This is also the most irritating because there is no obviously hateful or violent content, and can be written off as "just a joke." <span role="img" aria-label="face with rolling eyes">🙄</span></undefined></p><p>This is a specific type of trolling I was experiencing, called "dogpiling":</p><blockquote><p>Dogpiling: When a group of trolls works together to overwhelm a target through a barrage of disingenuous questions, threats, slurs, insults, and other tactics meant to shame, silence, discredit, or drive a target offline. — <a href="https://onlineharassmentfieldmanual.pen.org/defining-online-harassment-a-glossary-of-terms/">PEN America</a></p></blockquote><p>This is not a new tactic used to silence, but it was the first time I've personally experienced it. Good thing I designed a lot of our moderation tools and have talked about the <a href="https://youtu.be/5CSQYMOWOtQ?t=580">taxonomy of online abuse</a> before, and recognized this type of harassment quickly. I was able to get help from amazing coworkers, <a href="https://twitter.com/cheshire137">Sarah Vessels</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deniseyu21">Denise Yu</a>, to query my repo's referral data. The traffic was coming from 4chan... two 4chan threads totaling nearly 500 disturbing comments.</p><p>Seeing this shit was absolutely surreal. The GitHub content was annoying, but this made me feel sick. I still remember the feeling of being so overwhelmed and just sobbing at my desk. Reading disgusting, racist, sexist comments about me. Seeing screenshots of my face plastered across the threads. Understanding the exact moment where the dogpiling was coordinated. Realizing this was likely to keep happening (and it did).</p><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p><p>I'm not famous and I don't have a very large platform, so why me?</p><p>Upon reading the threads, there were some pretty clear reasons why this happened to me. I'll dig deeply into each one. <em>HUGE shoutout to my kat-ops counterpart <a href="https://twitter.com/pifafu">Kathy Zheng</a> for helping me compile screenshots!</em></p><h2>I'm a woman.</h2><p><undefined>Well, this was the most obvious reason. Women disproportionately experience online harassment, and very much so for sexual harassment. I included a few snippets but won't spend too much time on this one because it was some boring, basic bitch shit that we've all seen before <span role="img" aria-label="">🤷🏻‍♀️</span></undefined></p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>This one in particular stood out to me because it's a very specific type of harassment I've received my whole life, usually from East Asians. This piece of trash is stating that I'm subhuman because of my Vietnamese heritage. Tbh, this hits harder than boring 'ol "chink." The colorism here makes me think this was an Asian dude. And speaking of which:  </p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>I also received an email from what appears to be an MRAsian...

The amount of transphobic and anti-Black racist comments because of this was sickening. Attacking allyship is yet another tactic to silence and isolate us.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>I'd like to point out that the idea of avoiding "diversity hires" as to not lower the bar of quality is still a prevalent sentiment within tech. Again, these are not just nameless 4chan trolls—they're people in our industry.</p><h2>... and should be punished.</h2><p>Yeah, these are gross. Apparently I should get fired and deserve the harassment because I'm an attention seeking whore on a programming platform! The platform I work on and create more value to developers than you ever will in your life!!</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>That wasn't every screenshot from the threads, but is a good summary. The sheer volume of comments was definitely one of the more overwhelming aspects of this fuckery. Thanks for reading along this far.</p><h2>So if it wasn't clear:</h2><p><undefined>I was targeted by racist techies because of my background and visibility in order to be silenced and driven out of this industry. <span role="img" aria-label="middle finger">🖕</span></undefined></p><p>It was particularly cruel to harass me on the platform I work on everyday, where I design for open source communities. I couldn't focus at work and ended up taking two weeks off. This experience has really impacted the way I view tech and my place in it—but I'll save that for another post. </p><p>I've already accepted that this won't be my last brush with online harassment, so long as I'm still a visible Asian woman in tech. And this is going to continue happening to me and less privileged tech workers for just existing and being successful. All we can do is protect and support each other, because it's not our job to fix this problem.</p><p>It's your move next, tech. Here are my suggestions, you can have them for free:  </p><h2>To the most privileged tech leaders:</h2><p>When these events happen to your employees, are you investing actual money to support them? Are you monitoring content, encouraging time off, creating company policies, and covering their therapy? In lucky cases like mine, where the bulk of harassment may happen on the platform the victim works on, are you actively fixing pain points your employee experienced? Make sure you have a policy and detailed playbook, and definitely don't expect your marginalized employees to fix these problems for you. Don't wait until an incident arises—<strong>it's always an "edge case" until someone's personal safety is threatened.</strong></p><p>By not having intentional protections for the most vulnerable in place, you're preventing employees from being productive at work (because they're dealing with bullshit!). And you're absolutely driving away diverse talent from joining your company. It's actually fucking up your business. Access and representation in tech isn't a pipeline or qualification problem. <strong>It's a white supremacy problem.</strong></p><blockquote><p>And what still really creeps me out is that these people felt so emboldened to troll an EMPLOYEE using their actual GitHub accounts with legitimate work and contributions. <u>These harassers are everyday software engineers.</u></p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I want to circle back to this point about users with legitimate coding work harassing me. It's easy to dismiss these trolls as incel 4channers that we shun and don't associate with. Lol no. These are your people. They work at your companies and write your code. They are harassing or doxxing your other employees. This toxic behavior is still very much a part of your tech culture, and you keep rewarding it.</p><p>Fix. This. Shit.</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Developing with React hooks is fun for me. I have been developing several libraries. The very first library was a library for global state. It’s naively called “react-hooks-global-state” which turns out to be too long to read.</p><p>The initial version of the library was published in Oct 2018. Time has passed since then, I learned a lot, and now v1.0.0 of the library is published (<a href="https://github.com/dai-shi/react-hooks-global-state" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">react-hooks-global-state</a>).</p><p>This post shows simplified versions of the code step by step. It would help understand what this library is aiming at, while the real code is a bit complex in TypeScript.</p><h2 id="step-1-global-variable">Step 1: Global variable</h2><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>let</span><span> globalState </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  count</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  text</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'hello'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>Let’s have a global variable like the above. We assume this structure throughout this post. One would create a React hook to read this global variable.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useGlobalState</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> globalState</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>This is not actually a React hook because it doesn’t depend on any React primitive hooks.</p><p>Now, this is not what we usually want, because it doesn’t re-render when the global variable changes.</p><h2 id="step-2-re-render-on-updates">Step 2: Re-render on updates</h2><p>We need to use React <code>useState</code> hook to make it reactive.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>const</span><span> listeners </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Set</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span></span></p><p><span>3</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>useGlobalState</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>state</span><span>,</span><span> setState</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>globalState</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>listener</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      </span><span>setState</span><span>(</span><span>globalState</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    listeners</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>10</span><span>    </span><span>listener</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>11</span><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> listeners</span><span>.</span><span>delete</span><span>(</span><span>listener</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>12</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> state</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>14</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></p></pre></div><p>This allows to update React state from outside.

<blockquote>
<p>This project was based on a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24187794">Hacker News discussion</a>, thank you for all your input!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been recently paying attention to the <a href="https://clothingthegap.com.au/pages/free-the-flag">#freetheflag</a> debate, in short;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Aboriginal flag <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2008L00209">of Australia</a> is widely used by indigenous Australians as a symbol of their heritage. Though, the flag is actually copyrighted by an <a href="https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/articles/aboriginal-flag#:~:text=Flag%20copyright,the%20author%20of%20the%20flag.&amp;text=The%20copyright%20license%20for%20the,to%20Carroll%20and%20Richardson%20Flags.">indigenous individual</a> who has exclusive control of the licensing rightfully. This has become a debate because a lot of Aboriginals believe they should have a right to print or copy the Aboriginal flag as they would like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Just a quick shout out to my mob, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuku_Yalanji">Kuku Yalanji</a> people of Far North Queensland)</p>
<p>Over the years I've been trying to learn machine learning but never got anywhere because I couldn't think of a use case. I recently read a cool post from <a href="https://clothingthegap.com.au/pages/aboriginal-flag-timeline">Clothing The Gap</a> which gives an overview of the current copyright debate. They had an image that contains the "Aboriginal flag" done by a European artist several years earlier and how this could maybe be used to invalidate copyright as the design was perhaps already in existence. This gave me the idea to think about if there were perhaps other artworks throughout history that may have contained the flag design.</p>
<p>My main idea was that if I could use machine learning to train a computer vision model to find Aboriginal flags. I could then run it over historical archives of images/paintings to see if I can find any other places the Aboriginal flag seemingly appeared throughout history. Such that in a court case one might overturn the copyright by simply saying they were printing an "Indonesian symbol from the 14th century" (just a potential example)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nJwFE7K.jpg" alt="asdas"></p>
<p>If you look at the top left of the image, you will see an Aboriginal flag in this painting. I considered my model training a success once it could find the flag in this sample</p>
<p>It does actually work and as you can see in the above image, the model is able to draw a bounding box around the "flag".</p>
<p>I've only scanned 100,000 historical images so far and yet to find any pre-existing artworks that contain the flag. I still have a couple of million images to get through and hope to add a couple million more.</p>
<p>But here is a gallery of false positives, images that the model thought were aboriginal flags but not quite... (if you look at the images for long enough you can see why maybe the model thought it was an aboriginal flag)</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/Q22VnGK">Results</a></p>
<p>I've also saved some of the resulting data in a <a href="https://airtable.com/shrHq7PG7CF7axGB4">table</a> for anyone who wants to take a closer look.</p>
<p>I will keep working on the project to improve the results, and all of the code is open-source and free to use.</p>
<p>The rest of this post is for people who would like to run the code themselves and learn how to train an object recognition model from scratch. It is less than 20 lines of code in total and I've made everything as simple as possible with all resources available in the repo.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to help me train a better model then please <a href="https://ajaxdavis.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#691d010604081a08051e10070d081f001a290e04080005470a0604">reach out</a>!</p>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<p>I had no prior experience in computer vision, so I had no idea how I might train a model to do this. I managed to do it in a week, it is super easy for anyone with a bit of programming knowledge. The CV community is big and beautiful and I managed to get my idea working with PyTorch in a night. (I spent a few nights on Tensorflow and didn't get very far)</p>
<p>This tutorial is self-contained and can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>.</p>
<p>Again, the tutorial contains very little code thanks to a few open-source projects it depends on.</p>
<p>I also had a problem with the complexity of the language in the CV community so I'm going to purposely oversimplify things here.</p>
<p>This is super easy and you could likely have it working in under an hour. (Then add ML to your <a href="https://jsonresume.org/">resume</a>)</p>
<p>We are going to split the tutorial into three steps;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Classification</strong> - We need to manually draw boxes around the objects we are looking for in some sample images. The machine learning will use this human-curated data to train itself.</li>
<li><strong>Training</strong> - Once we have a classified data-set of images, we can use <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> to train a reusable model.</li>
<li><strong>Identification</strong> - Now that we have a model, we want to see if it can correctly find the desired object in a given sample image</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's do it!</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<pre><code>

git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model
<span>cd</span> aboriginal-flag-cv-model
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we are just going to train a model to find Aboriginal flags. But after you've finished this, you should be able to train a model to detect any object you would like. (Simple things, not hard things like if a person is <em>sad</em>).</p>
<p>So the initial classification is a human step, but it's kinda fun to do and will help you understand what the model can detect.</p>
<p>We start with an <code>images</code> folder which is in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>.</p>
<pre><code>/images
  1.jpg
  2.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially we have to use our monkey minds to draw bounding boxes around images that contain the desired object we are looking for.</p>
<p>And generate an associated XML file for each file that describes those bounding boxes.</p>
<p>After we are finished our directory should look like</p>
<pre><code>/images
  1.jpg
  1.xml
  2.jpg
  2.xml
</code></pre>
<p>The easiest program to do this in (and a kind of nostalgic UI) is called <code>labelImg</code></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg">https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg</a></p>
<p>You will have to figure out how to install and run it yourself.</p>
<p>Once open, point it at the <code>images</code> folder from the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>, once you figure out how to use the program, you will start drawing boxes and saving the XML to the <code>images</code> directory. And by the end of it, it should look like the directory structure above.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yWL5vcb.jpg" alt="labelImg screenshot"></p>
<p>The XML contains a label that you will be able to define when drawing bounding boxes. The model will require you later to use the same label in the training, for this example you should just use the label <code>aboriginal_flag</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xc7RMDR.jpg" alt="labelImg screenshot"></p>
<p>The way you draw your boxes does change the outcome of the model, for the Aboriginal flag I tended to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave a bit of outer space around the shape of the flag</li>
<li>Choose images at all angles and depths</li>
<li>Didn't worry if a limb or object was in front of the flag</li>
<li>Chose real flags, paintings of flags, full-scale images of the flag</li>
<li>A mixture of single or multiple instances of the object</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have your images and associated XML files generated, you are ready to start training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you get too lazy to classify the 40 images in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>, just copy the files in <code>images_classified</code> into <code>images</code>. I do recommend classifying them manually your self to see how small nuances might influence the learning model. Choosing images of different shapes, colors, angles, sizes, depth and so on will make your model more robust.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>So next we want to generate a model, and PyTorch/Detecto makes this easy by letting us generate one file to store all of our learned data  in e.g. <code>model.pth</code></p>
<p>We point PyTorch/Detecto at our classified data set and it should spit out a <code>model.pth</code> which we will use later to find our object (flag) in samples.</p>
<p>What really makes this whole tutorial so easy is the fact we will be using a python library called <a href="https://github.com/alankbi/detecto">Detecto</a> written by <a href="https://github.com/alankbi/">Alan Bi</a> (thanks man, beautiful job)</p>
<p>The entire code to go from the <code>dataset</code>(folder of images and XML) to a<code>reusable object recognition model</code> is below.</p>
<p>WARNING: You might need a decent computer to even run 3 epochs let alone 6 so if you just want to get a copy of a decently trained model, just download my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WrL1lV85njUwLR_pYaDD7fh1TV0lFKEN/view?usp=sharing">pre-trained model.pth</a></p>
<pre><code>



<span>from</span> detecto <span>import</span> core
<span>from</span> detecto.core <span>import</span> Model



dataset = core.Dataset(<span>'images_classified/'</span>)


model = Model([<span>'aboriginal_flag'</span>])








model.fit(dataset, epochs=<span>3</span>, verbose=<span>True</span>)





model.save(<span>'model.pth'</span>)





</code></pre>
<p>To run it from within the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>;</p>
<pre><code>python3 train.py // Should output a file called model.pth
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The PTH file type is primarily associated with PyTorch. PTH is a data file for Machine Learning with PyTorch. PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It is primarily developed by Facebooks artificial intelligence research group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(If the above code didn't run for you, please make an <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model/issues">issue</a>.</p>
<p>Now onto the fun part, let's see if our generated model can find what we are looking for!</p>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<p>So now we should have a <code>model.pth</code> and a <code>samples/sample.jpg</code> in the <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model">repo</a>, let's run it to see if our model is smart enough to find the object.</p>
<p>Finding the objects coordinates in the picture is easy, but we also want to draw a box around the coordinates which requires just a bit more code.</p>
<p>To run it from the repo</p>
<pre><code>python3 findFlag.py
</code></pre>
<p>The code for that file is below, I've commented in how it works.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>from</span> detecto.core <span>import</span> Model
<span>import</span> cv2 



model = Model.load(<span>'model.pth'</span>, [<span>'aboriginal_flag'</span>])



image = cv2.imread(<span>"samples/sample.jpg"</span>)






labels, boxes, scores = model.predict(image)







print(labels, boxes, scores)




<span>for</span> idx, s <span>in</span> enumerate(scores):
    <span>if</span> s &gt; <span>0.3</span>: 
        rect = boxes[idx]
        start_point = (rect[<span>0</span>].int(), rect[<span>1</span>].int())
        end_point = (rect[<span>2</span>].int(), rect[<span>3</span>].int())
        cv2.rectangle(image, start_point, end_point, (<span>0</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>255</span>), <span>2</span>)

cv2.imshow(<span>"Image"</span> + str(idx), image)

cv2.waitKey(<span>0</span>)

</code></pre>
<p>If you are having a good day, an image should have appeared on your screen. And if you are having a lucky day, then the Python script should have also drawn a rectangle over the image.</p>
<p>That is all there is really, you obviously can just take the outputted prediction data (boxes and scores) and save it to where ever you would like e.g. a database.</p>
<p>If something didn't work feel free to complain in the tutorial repo <a href="https://github.com/australia/aboriginal-flag-cv-model/issues">issues</a>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I do hope it worked, those steps above worked for me. I drew an Aboriginal flag on paper and took selfies at many angles and the model picked it up. (I manually classified 150 images instead of 40 though) (and if I call recall correctly, around 10 epochs)</p>

<p>This tutorial is meant to be a complete noob guide (written by a noob), how I've described things, and the way they are in computer vision - are two different things.</p>
<p>This task has allowed me to introduce myself to the computer vision sector and I'm sure I will learn more over …</p></div></div>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 30 Jan 2019</p>
<h2 id="vector-spaces"><a href="#vector-spaces">Vector Spaces</a></h2>
<p>
A fascinating result that appears in linear algebra is the fact that the
set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a vector space over the set of
rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \) This may appear surprising at first
but it is easy to show that it is indeed so by checking that all eight
axioms of vector spaces hold good:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commutativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + y = y + x \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \) for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive identity vector:<br>
      We have \( 0 \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x + 0 = x \) for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive inverse vectors:<br>
      There exists \( -x \in \mathbb{R} \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of scalar multiplication:<br>
      \( a(bx) = (ab)x \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:<br>
      \( a(x + y) = ax + by \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and for
      all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition:<br>
      \( (a + b)x = ax + bx \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of scalar multiplicative identity:<br>
      We have \( 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( 1 \cdot x = x \) for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This shows that the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) forms a
  vector space over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \)
  Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that \(
  \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \) that is, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is a
  subfield of \( \mathbb{R}. \) Any field is a vector space over any of
  its subfields, so \( \mathbb{R} \) must be a vector space over \(
  \mathbb{Q}. \)
</p>


<h2 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
Here is an interesting problem related to vector spaces that I came
across recently:
</p>

<div>
<p>
Define two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \)
to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the identity
function. The axiom of choice is allowed.
</p>
<p>
A function \( f \) is periodic if there exists \( p \gt 0 \) such that
\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<em>
If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to pause
and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.
</em>
</p>


<h2 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>

<p>
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector
space has a basis. Since the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a
vector space over the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}, \) there
must be a basis \( \mathcal{H} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that every
real number \( x \) can be written uniquely as a finite linear
combination of elements of \( \mathcal{H} \) with rational coefficients,
that is,
\[
  x = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
\]
where each \( x_a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \{ a \in \mathcal{H} \mid x_a
\ne 0 \} \) is finite. The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is also known as the
Hamel basis.
</p>

<p>
We know that \( b_a = 0 \) for distinct \( a, b \in \mathcal{H} \)
because \( a \) and \( b \) are basis vectors.
</p>

<p>
In the above expansion of \( x, \) each \( x_a \) is a rational number
that appears as the coefficient of the basis vector \( a. \) Therefore
\( (x + y)_{a} = x_a + y_a \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \) Thus \(
(x + b)_{a} = x_a + b_a = x_a + 0 = x_a. \) This shows that a function
\( f(x) = x_a \) is a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( b
\in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{a\}. \)
</p>

<p>
Let us define two functions:
\begin{align*}
  f(x) &amp; = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a,
  &amp;
  g(x) &amp; = x_b b.
\end{align*}
where \( b \in \mathcal{H} \) and \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \) Let us
choose \( c \in \mathcal{H} \) such that \( c \ne b. \) Then \( f(x) \)
is a periodic function with period \( b \) and \( g(x) \) is a periodic
function with period \( c. \) Further,
\[
  f(x) + g(x)
  = \left( \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a \right) + x_b b
  = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
  = x.
\]
Thus \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are two periodic functions such that
their sum is the identity function.
</p>

                        <p>YARH.IO handheld and its unique modular design with exposed interfaces offers unprecedented connectivity with unlimited platforms and devices.<br></p>
                        <p>This model is powered by&nbsp;Raspberry Pi 3B+ and&nbsp;has the best ratio of functionality and computing power requirements for a mobile device. When it comes to the battery powered devices, the overall power consumption and longer
                            battery are more important then the extra processing power or memory.</p>
                        <p>For this model, the width of the main module is based on the keyboard dimensions for improved handling. The 5" Resistive Touch Screen 800x480 HDMI TFT LCD Display&nbsp;is a good option for YARH.IO as it&nbsp;will allow you to perform
                            all of the usual tasks with ease.&nbsp;<br></p>

September 7, 2020 | https://christian.bock.ml/posts/academic_meetings/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://christian.bock.ml/posts/academic_meetings/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p>I recently read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt’s</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenberg_(technologist)">Jonathan Rosenberg’s</a> book about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works">How Google Works</a>. While most content does not necessarily translate to academia, I think their list of rules for successful meetings does.
In this post, I will reiterate the list and comment on their applicability in academia. In general, all rules are also valid for non-academic meetings, but since I haven’t worked in industry for quite a while, I feel more comfortable taking the academic (PhD student) point of view. As you will see, I believe it’s the PhD student’s/junior researcher’s responsibility to make a meeting successful, and therefore, I want to stress that my/our meeting culture is by no means perfect, and I myself sometimes struggle to adhere to these rules.</p>

<p>Even though decision making is more and more outsourced to *your favorite communication platform* messages, in-person meetings (even virtual ones) are a much better tool to meet on an equal footing and reach mutual decisions. A proper meeting culture is therefore indispensable.</p>

<p><strong>*rage on*</strong><br>
My main concern with instant messengers is that we frequently begin to write in a tone in which we would not talk in-person, or worse: our communication partner “hears” a destructive tone in our messages that was not intended to be there. We all know this, yet we are quick in dismissing doubts about the language we chose; after all, only the content counts. I can assure you that it is impossible to read only the content; we will always question the motifs behind a message, which can be a problem if they are not clearly communicated. Humans love to “read between the lines”.
<br><strong>*rage off*</strong></p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think Slack et al. are great tools that increase efficiency, but when it comes to important or potentially sensitive topics, meetings should be preferred, and the following rules might help to make them more successful<sup><a href="#fn_order">1</a></sup>:</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-1-rule-1-have-an-agenda-span"><span id="rule_1">Rule 1: Have an agenda</span></h5>

<p>The first rule is actually not part of E&amp;J’s list; it is a no-brainer to have an agenda in industry. In academia, this is not always the case (e.g., ad-hoc meetings to “discuss an idea”). Even if it is just 3 bullet points in your head, <strong>know the meeting’s objective</strong> and communicate it to the attendees. Objectives are critical to keep the meeting on track and determine whether the meeting was successful. Sometimes the goal of a meeting is just to update others. For such meetings, I like to have two main threads: 1) I did this, and these are the results, and 2) This is where I got stuck, and need help with. I think the objective of an “update meeting” is never <em>only</em> to update others but always to also get help with the challenges you’re facing.</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-2-rule-2-meetings-should-have-a-single-decision-maker-owner-span"><span id="rule_2">Rule 2: Meetings should have a single decision-maker/owner </span></h5>

<p>Eric and Jonathan argue that there should be one person whose butt is on the line for making a decision, typically a person of high seniority. This is very tricky in academia, as sometimes the more senior person is not the one whose butt is on the line. Imagine you’re a PhD student, and you meet with your PI. While your PI comes up with 10 new ideas on improving your paper, which is 90% finished, it is <strong>your</strong> missed opportunity if you fail to include the 10 new aspects in time. In this case, the decision-maker should be the PhD student. Naturally, a decision should be reached together, and there are plenty of situations in which it makes sense to adhere to a “top-down” decision. However, <a href="#rule_5">Rule 5</a> underlines my reasoning.</p>

<h5 id="rule-3-if-you-attend-a-meeting-attend-the-meeting">Rule 3: If you attend a meeting, attend the meeting</h5>

<p>Close your laptop<sup><a href="#fn_laptop">2</a></sup>. Be attentive. Otherwise, don’t be there at all. If you have the feeling you are not needed, then the decision-maker should not have invited you.  If you have the urge to be on the phone or laptop, ask yourself: “Is my time really better spent doing task X, or am I doing someone a disservice by not properly attending this meeting?”. If you are the instigator of the meeting and have the feeling that people are not attentive, tell them. Also, ask them why they are not attentive (do this offline). You might also rethink your decision of whom to include next time.</p>

<h5 id="rule-4-meetings-are-not-like-government-agencies-they-should-be-easy-to-kill">Rule 4: Meetings are not like government agencies – they should be easy to kill</h5>

<p>This is a very important one: If the meeting’s purpose can’t be achieved, the decision-maker has to ask the hard question: Does it make sense to continue the meeting? This is true for recurring meetings (e.g., in 1-on-1s, we can ask: is it beneficial to continue the weekly schedule, or would a bi-weekly meeting be enough, or does this format not work at all?) and ongoing meetings (e.g., is everyone present we need to reach a decision?)</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-5-rule-5-the-decision-maker-should-be-hands-on-span"><span id="rule_5">Rule 5: The decision-maker should be hands on</span></h5>

<p>More often than not, the PhD student is the one who does the dirty work. She is the one who thinks and ruminates about one specific problem for hours and days. She comes up with ideas, trashes them, gets frustrated, and tries again. This is why she should “[…] call the meeting, ensure the content is good, set the objectives, determine the participants, and <strong>share the agenda</strong> (if possible)” to quote E&amp;J. Unfortunately, the last point is rare in academia; see <a href="#rule_1">Rule 1</a>.</p>

<h5 id="rule-6-even-if-a-meeting-is-not-a-decision-making-meeting-it-should-have-a-clear-owner">Rule 6: Even if a meeting is not a decision-making meeting it should have a clear owner</h5>

<p>In academia, the majority of our meetings are to update or brainstorm. I argue that in both scenarios, the PhD student should be the owner who takes care that there is a clear agenda, and all participants were able to prepare for the meeting. Ideally, the objectives of the meeting are shared a couple hours before the meeting takes place.</p>

<h5 id="span-id-rule-7-rule-7-meetings-should-be-manageable-in-size-span"><span id="rule_7">Rule 7: Meetings should be manageable in size</span></h5>

<p>E&amp;J recommend not more than eight people and ten at a stretch, and <strong>everyone</strong> should give their input. In big collaborations, this can be hard and makes the following even more important: Have proper communication channels for people who should know the meeting results but were not crucial to reaching a decision.</p>

<h5 id="rule-8-attendance-at-meetings-is-not-a-badge-of-importance">Rule 8: Attendance at meetings is not a badge of importance</h5>

<p>If you are not needed, don’t participate. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done since, often, politics still play a significant role in academia. Some scholars think it is essential to “show presence” even though their involvement in the project is negligible. I am convinced that you can spend your time more productively than by participating in meetings for projects you’re not actively involved in. Technically, <a href="#rule_7">Rule 7</a> should take care of this issue.</p>

<h5 id="rule-9-timekeeping-matters">Rule 9: Timekeeping matters</h5>

<p>A problem I observed a lot in meetings, is that they get into “overtime” <em>before</em> the core problems were solved. This is because scholars love to discuss details, and every itsy bitsy issue needs to be completely solved before we can continue. However, we should not only start our meetings on time but also end them with a proper summary of the findings. Of course, this requires to have a reasonable agenda and maybe even a time assignment for each topic. I would also recommend having a <strong>“rabbit hole watcher”</strong> who drags us out of the rabbit holes that our attention to detail digs for us.</p>

<p>In summary, there are a lot of crucial factors that determine the success of a meeting. If I had to pick a single rule, I’d go for <a href="#rule_2"> Rule 2</a>. If the owner of the meeting is genuinely interested in a positive outcome, she will naturally think about the majority of the other rules herself, and importantly will set objectives which make the success measurable.</p>

<p><span id="fn_order">1. Eric and Jonathan did not order their rules, I tried to order them by importance based on my (limited) experience.</span> <br>
<span id="fn_laptop">2. Unless you need it for note taking.</span></p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 17 Jul 2020</p>
<h2 id="optimal-lecture-time"><a href="#optimal-lecture-time">Optimal Lecture Time</a></h2>

<p>
I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten Lessons I
Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk presented by
Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>

<blockquote>
Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove
the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of
lectures.
</blockquote>

<p>
That's fine advice. In fact, the whole article is full of good advice
like this. Although it was written primarily for mathematicians, a lot
of what is said in the article applies quite well to professionals in
other fields too.
</p>

<p>
The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how long a
microcentury is. It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could it?
</p>


<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury"><a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury</a></h2>
<p>
The English Wiktionary entry for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
(as of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and 34 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Not a standard unit of measurement, and used mostly humorously to denote
the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>

<p>
This looks incorrect to me. This is based on the oversimplified
assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes that
a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly 365 days.
If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed it would have
3 153 600 000 seconds and one millionth of it would be
3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52 minutes 33.6 seconds. This
looks consistent with the Wiktionary entry. However, an actual century
on the calendar does not have exactly 36500 days. Some years are leap
years, so the actual number of days in a century is more than that.
</p>


<h2 id="assumptions"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>
Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as possible. We
will count the leap years. We will ignore leap seconds because they are
irregularly spaced and unpredictable. We will also ignore the following
gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep 1752 when the British Empire switched
from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar:
</p><pre><samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code> command
as shown above on a Unix or Linux system. Ignoring this gap is
equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian calender
since the year 1 AD.
</p>

<p>
We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
year</em>. Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year begins a
new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the current
century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to 2099. The
computation presented in the next section works equally well for any
span of 100 years.
</p>


<h2 id="computation"><a href="#computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is, a
year that is a multiple of 100. A centurial year is a leap year <em>if
and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400. Apart from the centurial
year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years that are multiples of 4
and these are all leap years. From these facts, we can conclude that a
span of 100 years contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days. In other words,
a century has either 3 155 673 600 seconds or
3 155 760 000 seconds. Here is a
quick demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 100, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output of this program:
</p>

<pre><samp>0001-0101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s

0501-0601: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0601-0701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0701-0801: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0801-0901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0901-1001: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1001-1101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1101-1201: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1401: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1601: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1801: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2001: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds, that
is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one decimal
place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7 seconds.

September 7, 2020 | http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tl;dr: If you follow this blog you’ve seen me experiment with iframe-based citations; this post is about open-sourcing that tooling. <a href="#tutorial-start" target="_self">Skip</a> to demo, implementation tutorial, and GitHub link.</p>

<hr>

<p>Knowledge tooling is happily becoming a hot topic again. With this trend is coming revived interest in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Xanadu</a>, bi-directional hyperlinking, knowledge databases, visualizing knowledge graphs, and so on. At this moment, I see most of the emphasis being put on tooling for the research side, with Notion, Workflowy, and the new and hyped Roam Research leading the way.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/xanadu-shot.png" alt="Screenshot of the OpenXanadu prototpye"></p>

<p>Where I see less focus is the <em>writing</em> part of the knowledge production process, where older apps like Scrivener are still the thing to beat. And almost nobody at all is working on the reader’s experience. As a blogger who largely caters to a wide audience, I’m especially interested in these areas.</p>

<p>Written information is largely still presented as a single document, and writing tools are geared toward the production of long pages. But before I say what’s wrong with this, let me sing the praises of documents for a moment.</p>

<p>People often get carried away when they discover the original vision of hypertext, which involves a network of documents, portions of which are “transcluded” (included via hypertext) into one another. The implication is that readers could follow any reference and see the source material—and granted, this would be transformative. However, there’s a limit to the effectiveness of the knowledge network as a reading experience. “Hypertext books,” online books which are made up of an abundance of interlinked HTML pages, are mostly unpopular. The failure of this experiment is, in my opinion, very revealing.</p>

<p><img src="http://subpixel.space/uploads/sprawlingplaces-shot.jpg" alt="Screenshot of tinderbox map of hypertext book Sprawling Places by David Kolb">
<span>Tinderbox map of a portion of David Kolb’s hypertext book Sprawling Places</span></p>

<p>Knowledge is not an accumulation of facts, nor is it even a set of facts and their relations. Facts are only rendered meaningful within narratives, and the single-page document is a format very conducive to narrative structure. The hypertext books that have gained popularity (I’m thinking here of <a href="http://meaningness.com/">Meaningness.com</a>) have largely conformed to this in two ways: 1) there is an intended reading order, and 2) the longer essays within the project do most of the heavy lifting in terms of imparting the author’s perspective to readers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the notion of the “document” that is intrinsic to web development today is overdetermined by the legacy of print media. The web document is a static, <em>finished</em> artifact that does not bring in dynamic data. This is strange because it lives on a medium that is alive, networked, and dynamic, a medium which we increasingly understand more as a <em>space</em> than a thing.</p>

<p>For example, consider how silly it is to include MLA-style citations at the bottom of a text when we have the vast capabilities of linked documents on the web. Why should the reader have to read every citation or trust that an author is not taking a citation out of context, when hyperlinks are available?</p>

<p>This all suggests that a compromise must be struck between the coherence of a text and the new opportunities for knowledge work afforded by the fundamental capabilities of the medium: the internet’s connectivity, the screen’s frame rate.</p>

<hr>

<p>My own blogging is one context in which I’ve seen this tension play out, and have been working to explore ways of making my texts richer. A lot of the ideas I talk about in various pieces of writing are connected to one another. When I publish an essay, I’m not done with it. The ideas live on and get renewed, reused, and recycled in later works. Some sentences contain definitions that are core to my mental models, and there are whole paragraphs that might be useful out of context. I’m building my knowledge network in mind maps and behind various SaaS APIs, but how can I publicly show my thinking to be part a cohesive worldview?</p>

<p>Normally people solve this by simply block quoting themselves, but this is a waste of an opportunity. The indented block quote is a print medium invention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_quotation#Origins">almost as old as typesetting</a>. The block quote is <em>plaintext</em>, it is not actually linked to the original text or its context.</p>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with one idea for a solution, and if you’ve read the last couple blog posts you’ll have seen it there. My stab at an answer is an iframe which shows the quote within its original context and gives a hint at its surroundings. Effectively, it’s a transclusion within my own blog. I’m currently satisfied with what I have as a v1, and am interested to see if others find it useful, so I’m open sourcing it here and including a tutorial.</p>



<p>Open Transclude is a UX pattern, a spec for networked writing within your own blog. Here’s how it looks:</p>



<!-- <script src="/portal.js"></script> -->



<p>What you are looking at is an scroll-locked iframe that links to a quote I picked out of my blog post “Notes on Comparative Psychology.” You can use Open Transclude anywhere you can drop an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag on your own site.</p>

<p>Open Transclude:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Works anywhere on your own domain</li>
  <li>Compatible with most static site generators / templating engines</li>
  <li>12 lines of HTML, 80 lines of SCSS, 22 lines of JS (4.5 kb total)</li>
  <li>Has 0 dependencies&nbsp;— this is native web technology</li>
</ul>

<p>Open Transclude is extremely simple, and the heaviest part of the code is the CSS, which you can simplify at your whim. That’s why I am referring to it as a UX pattern. This is not a protocol. The code is really a commodity. What’s interesting about it is the idea and the design, and this is just one viable implementation! Feel free to adapt it however you like.</p>

<p>The principal improvement over a block quotation is <em>sense of context</em>.</p>

<p>Over on GitHub you’ll find the <a href="https://github.com/tobyshorin/Open-Transclude/">reference implementation for Jekyll</a>. Below is a tutorial for implementing it yourself, by way of also explaining some of the technical design decisions.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="implementation-recipe">Implementation Recipe</h2>

<p>Here’s what you need to do to get Open Transclude up and running.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an anchor tag in the blog post where you want to cite yourself.</li>
  <li>Create the HTML for the reusable transclusion component.</li>
  <li>Call the portal into any document and passing it Jekyll variables.</li>
  <li>A small piece of Javascript which populates your transclusion into the document.</li>
  <li>Create the SCSS file with the component’s styles.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-create-the-anchor-tag-where-you-want-to-cite-yourself">1. <strong>Create the anchor tag where you want to cite yourself</strong></h3>

<p>To quote yourself, you’ll need to create an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> anchor tag in the markdown file for the post you want to quote. If you wish to highlight a specific piece of text, instead create a <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> around the section you want to quote. Note that this can <em>only be on your own website</em>—it doesn’t work cross domain.</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like for the example iframe above.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="markdown">It will, for one thing, become newly conscious of itself, and, to the degree that it is, <span>**it will tend to undermine its own experiential integrity**</span>" (emphasis mine).

<span>&lt;span</span> <span>name=</span><span>"mainstream-magic"</span><span>&gt;</span>Ironically, psychology remains one of the closest things we have to a mainstream magic or a mystical art today. Not only is it plainly the direct descendent of medieval magic, as I learned when I read Ioan Coulianou's <span>*Eros and Magic in the Renaissance*</span> earlier this year. <span>**It is a theory of the self that is phenomenologically accurate, objectively wrong, and is based on magical thinking even as it deconstructs itself**</span>.<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span> Some magical thinking processes that happen in psychotherapy, such as <span>[</span><span>transference to the psychologist</span><span>](</span><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference#Transference_and_countertransference_during_psychotherapy</span><span>)</span>, are even intended to stay unmentioned to the patient in order to be utilized most effectively by the therapist!</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="2-create-your-iframe-component">2. Create your iframe component</h3>

<p>This is most useful as a standardized component which can be used across the site, so we are going to take advantage of Jekyll’s templating features. Jekyll and other static site generators like Kirby and Zola support HTML “partials” or “includes” so that you can create reusable components.</p>

<p>In your <code>/_scss</code> or <code>/_sass</code> folder make a new file, <code>portal.scss</code>. I called it “portal” because it’s shorter than “transclusion” and less prone to spelling errors.</p>

<p>Here’s our component:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-container"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-head"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-backlink"</span> <span>&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>From <span>&lt;span</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-text-title"</span><span>&gt;</span>{{ include.title }}<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
            <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"{{ include.link }}"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-arrow"</span><span>&gt;</span>Go to text <span>&lt;span</span> <span>class=</span><span>"right-arrow"</span><span>&gt;</span>→<span>&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;div</span> <span>id=</span><span>"portal-parent-{{include.anchor}}"</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent-fader-top"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;div</span> <span>class=</span><span>"portal-parent-fader-bottom"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>        
        <span>&lt;!-- We'll use Javascript to populate the iframe right here --&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>    
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You’ll notice immediately that the iframe isn’t there yet. Like I mentioned above, we’re going to be populating it with Javascript.</p>

<p>You’ll also see that in various places we’re using <code>{{ include.___}}</code>. A cool thing about Jekyll includes its that it’s possible to define variables and pass them to our include, so we can create reusable components across our site. Dave Rupert has a <a href="https://daverupert.com/2017/07/jekyll-includes-are-cool/">nice blog post about this</a> called if you want to see more advanced examples!</p>

<h3 id="3-calling-the-component">3. Calling the component</h3>

<p>Anytime you want to pull this component into a blog post, all you have to do is <code>include</code> it in the markdown of another blog post, like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="html">  {% include portal.html title="Notes On Comparative Psychology" link="/entries/notes-on-comparative-psychology/#mainstream-magic" anchor="emotional-deficit" %} </code></pre></figure>

<p>When you include it, you’ll need to pass in those three variables - title, link, and anchor, that fill in the includes above. If you’re following along now and making a build in Jekyll, you’ll see an empty, unstyled component with the link. So good so far!</p>

<h3 id="4-populating-with-javascript">4. Populating with Javascript</h3>

<p>This is a good time to address why we need Javascript. Web developers reading this are probably asking why we don’t simply put the full <code>/link#with-anchor</code> into the iframe src and be done with it. …</p></div></div>

        months and tips for how to apply the same reasoning to other things, like
        computers</p>
        <hr>
        <figure>
            <img src="http://calpaterson.com/assets/solitary-wheel.jpeg" alt="a solitary wheel left behind after the rest of the bike was nicked">
            <figcaption>
                Rucksack Rupert strikes again
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Some very commonly repeated advice on preventing someone from nicking your
        bike:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Buy a good [~10% of bicycle value] lock, ideally one with a high
            "SoldSecure" rating and lock your bicycle somewhere inside the rear
            triangle and the rear wheel.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I've seen this advice repeated in cycling magazines, in quality newspapers,
        sometimes even by the police and of course on internet forums.</p>
        <p>The above would imply that if you own a £400 bicycle (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/395884/bicycle-average-prices-in-the-european-union-eu-by-country/">a
        typical price in the UK</a>) you'd buy a £40 lock and put it in the right
        place.</p>
        <p>However, it is a cold fact that a cordless angle grinder can defeat any
        bicycle lock, no matter how expensive (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywN558dJaU&amp;t=198">see this video for a
        demonstration</a>). You can buy a used cordless angle grinder on eBay for less
        than £100. Even U-locks - traditionally thought to be the strongest type of
        lock - are opened in seconds with a sub-£100 angle grinder.</p>
        <p>There is other advice floating around of doubtful value, for example:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Add your bicycle to a national register</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But cases where BikeRadar manage to reunite bicycles with their owners seem
        to be the exception rather than the rule. Probably this is because, as with
        cars, the first thing you do with a stolen bicycle is take it across a border
        to somewhere different.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Lock your bicycle inside a secure building or place, away from sight</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This prevents opportunistic theft but if this space is shared with others
        (apartment blocks and offices) it in fact serves to increase the economies of
        scale for prepared thieves who break into your storage area late at night with
        a van. It's not uncommon for office bicycle stores (with many fancy, expensive
        bikes inside) to be emptied out completely overnight by professional
        thieves.</p>
        <h2>A threat model, by user persona</h2>
        <p>I think the advice above is poor because it doesn't come from a systematic
        consideration of the problem <em>from the point of view of thieves</em>.</p>
        <p>To come up with better advice requires a threat model, which is a piece of
        jargon for taking a holistic view of the danger posed by attackers. I think one
        of the simplest and most straightforward ways to do threat modelling is by
        <em>user persona</em>, whereby you consider each kind of attacker in turn,
        making some reasonable assumptions about their level of motivation and
        methods.</p>
        <p>As far as bicycle theft is concerned there are three basic types of
        thief.</p>
        <h3>"No-tools Nigel", the rank opportunist</h3>
        <p>Nigel has just his two hands and is simply looking for a ride home or maybe
        something he can sell to a friend for some quick cash.</p>
        <p>Nigel will steal any unlocked bicycle.</p>
        <p>Nigel is also able to take any bicycle parts that can be removed without
        tools. That means any quick-release wheels or thumbscrew saddles. In an urban
        area your parked bicycle may be passed by a Nigel as often as a few times an
        hour so anything that is not bolted down won't last very long.</p>
        <h3>"Rucksack Rupert", the thief with a few hand tools</h3>
        <p>Rupert has a small pair of shears; 4, 5 and 6mm Allen keys and a 15mm
        spanner for wheel nuts.</p>
        <p>Rupert will make his way through cable locks with his shears. If there is a
        valuable part that can be removed with hand tools he will take it. He is
        particularly keen on premium saddles and name brand wheels.</p>
        <h3>"Powertool Percy", the professional with a complete set of tools</h3>
        <p>Percy has a small collection of electric and air tools including an angle
        grinder as well as bolt-cutters and an air-jack. He has access to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fence_(criminal)">criminal fences</a> which he
        can use to sell stolen bicycles quickly. Percy often arrives in his van and
        this allows him to steal multiple bikes at once.</p>
        <p>No bicycle is safe from Percy. No lock can hold against his angle grinder.
        Often he finds if he's wearing a hi-vis jacket he can even get away with using
        his power tools in broad daylight. He's willing to chance that if the bicycle
        seems valuable enough.</p>
        <h2>Coming up with better advice based on Nigel, Rupert and Percy</h2>
        <p>In order to keep your bicycle safe you need to take steps against all three
        levels of imaginary thieves.</p>
        <p>"No-tools Nigel" will be warded off simply by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Locking your bicycle whenever you leave it - even if just for a
            minute</li>
            <li>Ensuring you leave nothing on your bicycle that can be removed without
            tools
                <ul>
                    <li>replace quick-release wheel skewers with bolts</li>
                    <li>take your lights with you when you park in public</li>
                    <li>make sure your saddle is not on a thumbscrew</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Rucksack Rupert" will be deterred by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not using a cable lock!</li>
            <li>Making sure that nothing good can be removed from your bicycle with
            hand tools

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The virtue of the "bicycle shaped object"</h2>
        <p>Valuable bicycles (&gt;£1000) have an extremely short half-life in urban
        areas. The sad truth is that the Percys of the world are common enough and
        resourceful enough that a bicycle worth over a thousand pounds isn't really
        safe anywhere in a large town. <strong>This includes most e-bikes.</strong> You
        might notice that cycle couriers who have e-bikes tend to eat lunch while
        looking directly at their locked e-bike, so that it never goes out of their
        sight. Few people in other lines of work can do the same.</p>
        <p>If the tyres are inflated, my own commuter bicycle is probably worth £30 to
        the right buyer. My bicycle is so low-end that cycling snobs refer to it as a
        mere "bicycle shaped object". Rather selfishly I am glad that such snobs exist
        as having a lot of more valuable bicycles around provides me with good ambient
        security. No thief is going to bother cutting my locks when there is a
        Campagnolo on the next rack.</p>
        <p>One father I know had his primary-school-age daughter "decorate" his
        commuting bicycle with girly stickers and pink glitter. If anyone examines his
        bicycle closely he looks like a complete loon but I think his motivation is
        right: it's going to be much less appealing to steal when it's covered in Miffy
        stickers.</p>
        <h3>Insurance - not usually worth it</h3>
        <p>What about bicycle insurance? It's fairly expensive here in the UK, usually
        10-15% of the bicycle's value annually and insurers typically only pay out when
        the whole bicycle is taken (so if if your front wheel is nicked, you're on your
        own) and when you can demonstrate that it was locked to their standards. Often
        these standards require that it is locked up indoors which means you're
        chancing it whenever you park away from your home or office.</p>
        <h2>Lists of "best practices" vs having your own threat model</h2>
        <p>The same thing goes for securing your bicycle as for securing other things:
        pat, concrete pieces of security advice are something to treat with a bit of
        doubt.</p>
        <p>In bicycles the common mantra is "spend 10% on a lock" but in computing the
        mantras are slogans such as "use a strong password", "back up your important
        data" or "use encryption" but these can all be just as vapid.</p>
        <p>"Strong passwords!" as a slogan fails to address the fact that the average
        internet user has hundreds of logins for various sites (my own password manager
        has over 700 sites recorded). The majority of internet users decide on a single
        "strong password" and then use it everywhere. They are only a single bad
        sysadmin or javascript injection away from losing access to every account on
        every website they have.</p>
        <p>Backing up your important data is only an aid to your security if the backup
        is stored as securely as the original. Much user data is stolen or exposed
        through poorly secured backups on shared fileservers. A huge number of people
        have passport and utility bill scans in their Dropbox - again, behind the same
        email and password they use everywhere. Companies can be surprisingly sloppy
        with backups too: often dumped into cloud storage somewhere once before the Big
        Migration and never removed.</p>
        <p>Encryption is troublesome as it can give undue confidence that can backfire
        spectacularly: a quarter of a million American diplomatic cables were
        inadvertantly published in unredacted form when a Guardian journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:_Inside_Julian_Assange%27s_War_on_Secrecy">
        included the password for an widely-distributed encrypted file in his book</a>.
        Apparently he thought the file's password was somehow temporary. It wasn't.</p>
        <p>Instead of following such "best practices" it's much more intellectually
        robust to <strong>come up with your own threat model</strong> - then you can
        decide your own concrete steps instead of just following the security steps of
        others which might be inapplicable or even wrong.</p>

<p>A ready-to-install jupyter extension which converts english queries into relevant code. Built as a proof of concept for the problem we personally face of <strong>forgetting less-used syntaxes of pandas and plotly libraries</strong> which is often used in Exploratory Data Analysis. This tool allows us to query in a generic language without having to remember the syntax.</p>

<p>Inspired by cool GPT-3 demos and not having the access to the API, here is an attempt by us to build a Text2Code extension using publicly available libraries. The approach isn't generative, but relies on identifying &amp; matching from a set of predefined <em>intents</em> and generating the relevant code by extracting relevant entities and inserting them in a template. Adding new intents and extending the functionality is easy once the pipeline is in place. </p>

September 7, 2020 | https://wundergraph.com/blog/2020/09/06/scaffolding_react_app_with_graphql | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wundergraph.com/blog/2020/09/06/scaffolding_react_app_with_graphql">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Let us imagine that by writing a handful of GraphQL queries, it would be possible to build a fully functional React
application. For a TODO app, we could allow users to login, post, retrieve, update and complete tasks. In this post, I'll explain how WunderGraph could be leveraged to achieve such a thing, and what the implications are.</p><h2>What is WunderGraph?</h2><p>Before we dig in, let's have a quick overview of what WunderGraph is in order to fully understand the scenario.</p><p>WunderGraph is a GraphQL Engine that compiles Queries on the server, exposes them as persisted operations and then
generates smart clients to help you to consume them.</p><p>While GraphQL doesn't lose its dynamic character, this approach makes using GraphQL a lot safer and more performant.
Additionally, because Queries &amp; Mutations are persisted on the server by default, you are now uniquely able to use
directives in Operations.</p><p>A few example queries to illustrate:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>query</span><span> AllTasks</span><span>(</span><span>$email</span><span>:</span><span> String</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>@fromClaim</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"email"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  queryTask</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>eq</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>$email</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    id</span></p><p><span>    title</span></p><p><span>    completed</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>mutation</span><span> AddTask</span><span>(</span><span>$title</span><span>:</span><span> String</span><span>!</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>$email</span><span>:</span><span> String</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>@fromClaim</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"email"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  addTask</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>{</span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>$title</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>completed</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>$email</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    task </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      id</span></p><p><span>      title</span></p><p><span>      completed</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>mutation</span><span> SetTaskCompleted</span><span>(</span><span>$id</span><span>:</span><span> ID</span><span>!</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>$completed</span><span>:</span><span> Boolean</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>$email</span><span>:</span><span> String</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>@fromClaim</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"email"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  updateTask</span><span>(</span><span>input</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>filter</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>$id</span><span>]</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>eq</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>$email</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>completed</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>$completed</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    task </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>      id</span></p><p><span>      title</span></p><p><span>      completed</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Above, we have 3 operations:</p><p>AllTasks - Lists all tasks for a user by their email address
AddTask - To add a task for a user
SetTaskCompleted - To mark a task as complete</p><p>The above three Operations are quite standard with one slight exception, They contain a custom directive:
<code>@fromClaim(name: "email")</code>. This directive ensures that the variable <code>$email</code>, is always obtained from a JWT claim
<code>email</code>.</p><p>If you're not yet familiar with the concepts of WunderGraph, this is absolutely safe because only the server
(WunderGraph console) can define and persist an Operation.</p><p>This means that a user needs to be logged-in to interact with these queries &amp; only the logged in user can create, list
or update their own tasks.</p><p>Next, we use wundergen (our code generator) to generate an OpenID client that is preconfigured with our backend, all
type definitions for the GraphQL schema as well as React hooks for each Operation.</p><p>This process is pretty much straight forward as we just take all the configuration and run it through a template. We can
now just consume the TODO API as if it were just another function call.</p><h2>Why can't we scaffold the entire site?</h2><p>Well, at the moment this is just a concept, so I want to hear your feedback first before implementing it. Let's have a
look at some ideas on how we might implement this. As I said before we will only be writing GraphQL Operations so
let's revisit them:</p><div><div><div tabindex="0"><div><p><span>query</span><span> AllTasks</span><span>(</span><span>$email</span><span>:</span><span> String</span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>@fromClaim</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"email"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>@ui</span><span>(</span><span>page</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/tasks"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>component</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>TABLE</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  queryTask</span><span>(</span><span>filter</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>email</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>eq</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>$email</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span>@ui</span><span>(</span><span>linkTo</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/tasks/:id"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>        id </span><span>@ui</span><span>(</span><span>columnName</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"ID"</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>        title </span><span>@ui</span><span>(</span><span>columnName</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Title"</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>        completed </span><span>@ui</span><span>(</span><span>columnName</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Completed"</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>The <code>AllTasks</code> Query will generate a table component on the <code>/tasks</code> route.

Operations might get complex quite fast though.</p><p>We're definitely limited in what we could achieve with this. However, there will be use cases where customization is
not as important as the cost of development.</p><p>WunderGraph allows you to connect any possible datasource (at least that's the vision) so if you wanted to build
Dashboards or Admin panels, or even a simple contact page on top of your existing APIs this could be a very
convenient way to achieve it without code.</p><p>There might be quite a compelling use-case for rapid prototyping. Consider the flow: Deploy a CRUD GraphQL backend,
write a bunch of Operations and your app is ready to deploy. How much faster could it be? You could then customize
the scaffolded views &amp; forms as you saw fit.</p><p>Maybe the idea to directly introduce navigation between pages is a step too far. Maybe we could just generate
Components based on the Operations and let the user define Navigation manually?</p><p>But then, how would you go about customizing the pre-generated components without breaking when re-generating the code
after a change to the Operations?</p><p>Would multiple templates be useful so that users could choose between Material-UI or Bootstrap etc... Would that make
sense?</p><h3>What do you think?</h3><p>Finally, I think this is not yet ready for implementation. I need your feedback to see if this approach is useful for
you. Do you have ideas on how you could use this? Is there anything missing to make it work for you?</p><p>Please meet us on <a href="https://discord.gg/Jjmc8TC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discord</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wundergraph/community/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>

<p>Welcome to the first in a series of articles on getting started with Next.js. In this very first starting point, we'll be looking at creating a brand new Next.js project using the very helpful <code>create-next-app</code> tool.</p>
<p>From there, we'll be setting up WordPress as a headless CMS to manage our blog posts' content for us.</p>
<p>As we move through future articles in the series, we'll be covering a lot of moving parts to round out the entire process, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting a blog using Next.js,</li>
<li>Using WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js,</li>
<li>Creating an RSS feed for our static Next.js blog</li>
<li>Bundling, building and deploying our Next.js static blog with Netlify</li>
</ul>
<p>For this very article, however, we're just going to start with the basics of getting Next.js and our headless WordPress instance setup and ready to go.</p>
<p>So let's get to it!</p>
<h2>Why Next.js</h2>
<p><a href="https://nextjs.org/" title="Next.js from Vercel">Next.js</a> (made by a company called <a href="https://vercel.com/" title="Vercel static website hosting">Vercel</a> — formally Zeit) is a React-based framework for producing static-generated websites. It fills in some of the blanks of using React in its vanilla form, such as dynamic page routing, and it also allows developers a bevvy of choices of where to get their data from to power their static websites.</p>
<h3>Isn't it just like Gatsby</h3>
<p>It's very comparable to <a href="https://nextjs.org/" title="Next.js from Vercel">Gatsby</a> (which I also love) in many ways. Indeed Next.js and Gatsby share the same end goal: to connect data with a static-generator engine to produce a static website.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer Next.js the more I use it. Whilst Gatsby offers a more mature eco-system with its plugins and community, Next.js offers a much less complex setup and often requires fewer plugins to achieve the same thing.</p>
<p>I'd recommend trying both and seeing which you prefer.</p>
<h2>Why use WordPress as a headless CMS</h2>
<p>WordPress is an often maligned platform, but it does power something close to 35% of the entire web. It's a hugely popular content management platform and most people have come across it, if not directly used it at some point during their time.</p>
<p>However, it does have a reputation for being quite clunky at times and it takes some work to produce a performant website on the front end.</p>
<p>One of the best reasons to consider WordPress as a headless CMS is that it solves the largest problem facing static-generated websites: editing content!</p>
<p>Sure, for most developers (me included) this isn't so much of a burden. For example, I use <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="Forestry.io markdown CMS">Forestry.io</a> as a markdown editor/CMS to edit the markdown files that power this very site directly in my GitHub repo.</p>
<p>Other developers may choose to just edit HTML directly, and that's fine and dandy.</p>
<p>But what about 'normal' users, marketers, content editors, <em>non-developers</em>?! Editing markdown or HTML files is a bit beyond their needs or, perhaps, their skillsets.</p>
<p>By using WordPress as a headless CMS with Next.js, it's win win win. Website visitors get performant, accessible websites. Developers get a great developer experience and aren't hampered by the very opinionated and clunky PHP development required for WordPress. And content producers and site owners still get to use their favourite content management tool, WordPress, to handle the editing process!</p>

<h2>Step 1, getting WordPress ready for Next.js</h2>
<p>Installing and getting a WordPress instance going is beyond the scope of this article and there are many places to help get you started with that.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a recommendation then check out <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/" title="Amazon Lightsail hosting">Amazon's Lightsail</a>, or the AWS platform in general as there are often free tiers available, especially whilst you're just getting started.</p>
<p>What we're bothered about here is adding some necessary bits and pieces to a WordPress website to turn it into a headless CMS for Next.js to access.</p>
<p>So, assuming you already have a WordPress instance set up, let's move on.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e8f504d6e8834e2f39467d5d570671a22ab328f0/15fa3/img/nextjs-demo-robkendal.jpg" alt="Demo WordPress website from Rob Kendal"></p>
<p>(PS - if you want to use my demo site, which I'm using in this article, then you can check it out here - <a href="http://demo.robkendal.co.uk/" title="Demo WordPress website for linking to Next.js">http://demo.robkendal.co.uk/</a></p>
<h3>Installing WPGraphQL (and plugins)</h3>
<p>Out of the box you can use the WordPress REST API to fetch data and so on, but we're going to be using GraphQL to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>This does mean we have to install a few plugins, however, before we can start accessing our data via Next.js.</p>
<p>So, we'll be heading over to <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/" title="WPGraphQL plugin">https://www.wpgraphql.com/</a> and we'll want to install the following plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/releases" title="WPGraphQL plugin">WPGraphQL main plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-acf" title="WPGraphQL for ACF plugin">WPGraphQL for ACF</a> (advanced custom fields)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql" title="WPGraphiQL plugin">WPGraphiQL</a> - a visual query builder/explorer for GraphQL</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>with the WPGraphQL stuff, you'll have to visit those links, download the Source Code (zip) as zip files and upload them to WordPress manually via the Admin Menu &gt; Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload dialog.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/20fccd08ff42eab3a803c36749a5dd5476913b33/abf82/img/nextjs-article-wpgraphql.jpg" alt="WPGraphQL releases plugin download page"></p>
<p>The reason for favouring GraphQL is that it's faster than the REST API and GraphQL gives us the power and flexibility to return only the data we need. Using the WPGraphiQL plugins also allows us to both build our queries directly inside of our WordPress instance before moving them into Next.js</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is hugely important as we can see the output of the queries, testing and tweaking them as we go, <em>before</em> we have to blindly add them to our local dev instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll also need once last plugin, <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" title="WordPress Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin">Advanced Custom Fields</a> (ACF). This will allow us to add extra fields to our posts or pages to extend their content capabilities.</p>
<h3>Adding custom fields to posts</h3>
<p>Next, and this part is optional if you don't want/need custom fields on your posts, we'll set up a few custom fields using ACF and make sure they're enabled for WPGraphQL, <strong>otherwise they won't show up</strong>.</p>
<p>Head over to your WordPress admin console and then to Custom Fields &gt; Field Groups and make a new one, calling it whatever you like.</p>
<p>For my site, I called the Field Group 'Extra Post Info'. Then, I added three fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>Author Excerpt - a text area field</li>
<li>Preview Image - a simple image selection field</li>
<li>Thumbnail Image - as above</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2e1688bc8fe3a58371879f35d13803da2b0b4138/fc5ae/img/nextjs-article-acf-setup.jpg" alt="WordPress ACF fields setup"></p>
<p>You can add whatever fields you wish and name them to suit your needs.</p>
<p>From here, scroll all the way to the bottom of this page and enable the WPGraphQL settings as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure <code>Show in GraphQL</code> is set to 'Yes'</li>
<li>For <code>GraphQL Field Name</code> set this to a meaningful and descriptive name for your extra fields. This will be the name we use to reference the extra fields in GraphQL. Here, I named mine <code>extraPostInfo</code></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/cb9f2bf0cdbde1947b3f8fb306f0372b14404522/b0110/img/nextja-article-ac-graphql-settins.jpg" alt="WPGraphQL settings to enable custom fields to show up"></p>
<p>And that's that. One final thing is to populate a few dummy posts in the Posts section of the admin menu. Just create a handful of new posts and add in whatever content you wish (I find Lorem Ipsum works just fine here).</p>
<h3>Viewing our Posts in GraphQL</h3>
<p>Having installed all the necessary WPGraphQL posts, added some extra fields, and made sure those were added to the GraphQL schema, with some dummy Post content in place, we can go check out the Posts data via the WPGraphiQL explorer.</p>
<p>Head over to the GraphiQL menu item in your WordPress admin console.</p>
<p>Now for the real magic! GraphiQL is a visual query builder that lets you simply expand and toggle data fields on the left hand side, build a query in the middle using those data fields, and execute that query to see what data is returned.</p>
<p>Very powerful stuff, I'm sure you'll agree. Now, the in's and out's of GraphQL language and the GraphiQL tool are entire articles and courses in themselves, but you can find out more from the <a href="https://graphql.org/" title="Official GraphQL website and documentation">official GraphQL website</a>.</p>
<p>For our purposes, you can see below that I've expanded various paths on the tree menu, starting with <code>posts</code> and this has automatically built me a query in the centre editor panel. When I pressed the big play button, the query is executed and the results shown in the rightmost panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/d7b87cf1fd0717aa70ffdf2ac855c7351e9db3be/6a9ed/img/nextjs-article-graphiql-query.png" alt="GraphiQL query data builder"></p>
<p>The query built looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>    query MyQuery {
      posts {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            date
            title
            slug
            featuredImage {
              node {
                mediaItemUrl
              }
            }
            extraPostInfo {
              authorExcerpt
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>And this query returns something along the lines of this data:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "data": {
    "posts": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "cG9zdDoyOA==",
            "date": "2020-07-09T07:18:42",
            "title": "A third post with an interesting name",
            "slug": "a-third-post-with-an-interesting-name",
            "featuredImage": null,
            "extraPostInfo": {
              "authorExcerpt": "I'm a thing. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Okay, I like a challenge. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "id": "cG9zdDoyNQ==",
            "date": "2020-07-09T07:17:19",
            "title": "Another awesome post with a really long title",
            "slug": "another-awesome-post-with-a-really-long-title",
            "featuredImage": null,
            "extraPostInfo": {
              "authorExcerpt": "It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why would I want to know that? Fry, we have a crate to deliver. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards."
            }
          }
        },
        ...others
      ]
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And with that, we have our WordPress instance set up as a headless CMS with the Posts data all ready to go in a nice, neat GraphQL query.</p>
<h2>Step 2, creating a Next.js project</h2>
<p>The final step in the project setup process to use WordPress as a headless CMS using Next.js is the most important part: Next.js!</p>
<p>As it happens, <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setup" title="Next.js Create Next App tool documentation">Next.js has a project create tool</a> called <code>create-next-app</code> which will create us a bootstrapped Next.js app with the barebones of configuration ready to go.</p>
<p>Much like React's own <code>create-react-app</code> tool, the <code>create-next-app</code> tool is run from the command line and creates a directory with all the necessary project files in …</p></div></div>

September 7, 2020 | https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>i’m writing this like a day after <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90539632/mozilla-vows-mdn-isnt-going-anywhere-as-layoffs-cause-panic-among-developers">big mozilla layoffs</a> that included a lot of people working on cool and important shit.
the consensus i’m seeing is that it reflects mozilla’s search for profit over impact, mismanagement, and disproportionate executive compensation.
this is taking place in a larger trend of corporatization of open source over the past several years, an ongoing open source sustainability crisis, and of course COVID-19, the all-consuming crisis that makes all our other crises worse.
all of this was summed up most concisely by <a href="https://twitter.com/zkat__/status/1293626135142477825">Kat Marchán</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imo, open source as a community endeavor is falling apart right before our eyes, and being replaced by open source as Big Corp entrenchment strategy.</p>

  <p>I mean it’s been happening for a while, but seeing Mozilla sinking like this is just driving the point home for me.</p>

  <p>FOSS is dead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>how did we get here?
where even are we?
what happens next?</p>

<p>i am incredibly unqualified to answer any of this - i didn’t show up until right around the peak of SourceForge, i wasn’t there for most of this - but i’m not gonna let that stop me.</p>

<h2 id="names">names</h2>

<p>to start this funeral service for FOSS, we have to unpack the term itself.
“free and open source software” as a term already contains multitudes.
on one hand, “free software”, an explicitly political movement with a decidedly anti-charismatic leader.
on the other hand, “open source software”, defanged and corporate-friendly by design.
the free software people (correctly) criticize “open source” as milquetoast centrism.
the open source people (correctly) criticize “free software” as stubborn idealism fighting tooth and nail to reject the real world as it actually exists.
they have as much in common as leftists and liberals (but they’re more prepared to work together), and although their short-term goals were similar enough that it made sense to lump them together (hence the cooperation), now that the movement is dead i think there’s more to gain from considering them separately.
most software licenses that i’m going to bring up technically qualify as both, but they’re popular with one or the other, so i’ll refer to “free software licenses” and “open source licenses” as licenses that are more directly tied to those movements, even though any given license likely meets both definitions.</p>

<p>i’d say free software died a while ago, and open source went horribly right.</p>

<h2 id="freedom">freedom</h2>

<p>the free software movement, for all its faults, has always known <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en">what it’s about</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>The freedom to run the program for any purpose.</li>
    <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</li>
    <li>The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbour.</li>
    <li>The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>it’s concise, it’s understandable, and it’s… kinda useless.
this point was <a href="https://lu.is/blog/2016/03/23/free-as-in-my-libreplanet-2016-talk/">raised better by actual lawyer Luis Villa</a> (Karl Marx slander notwithstanding), but those freedoms don’t actually mean shit to the average end user.
only programmers care if they have access to the source code, and most people aren’t programmers.
and i <em>am</em> a programmer, and i don’t give a shit.
the freedom to not think about my operating system and just get work done overrules all of those for me, so i use windows.
like, yeah, those things are all in principle nice to have, and between two otherwise equally good programs i’d take the free one.
but they’re really fuckin specific things, and even if i have the freedom to do them i’m not likely to have the ability or desire to do them, so there’s no good reason for me as a user to use software that’s worse in other ways because it gives me freedoms i don’t need.</p>

<p>the free software movement is explicitly political, but its politics suck.
it’s a movement by and for ideological diehards but the ideology is extremely esoteric.
theirs was a losing battle from day one.
so what was it that actually killed them?
i think in a very real way it was the GPLv3.</p>

<h2 id="losing">losing</h2>

<p>the flagship projects of the free software movement are probably Linux and the GNU pile of tools.
the Linux kernel being released under a free software license doesn’t directly create more free software, though, since even things that tie closely to the kernel aren’t obligated to also be free software, and of course user-level applications can have whatever license they want.
and also most of the people using Linux right now are using it by accident, distributed as ChromeOS or Android, neither of which is free software.
so Linux is a win for the free software movement but a useless one.</p>

<p>the GNU userland tools are, for the most part, even more underwhelming.
it may be technically more accurate to call it GNU/Linux, but the only time i remember my linux userland tools are GNU or free software at all is when there’s <a href="https://twitter.com/boring_cactus/status/1166408436386430976">some weird inconsistency between a GNU tool and its BSD equivalent</a>, and that’s not exactly ideal.
gcc had, as far as i can tell, been basically <em>the</em> C compiler for a while, if you weren’t stuck with MSVC or something worse.
the free software movement were stubborn ideologues with weird priorities, but they still had one big technical advantage.
then the GPLv3 happened.</p>

<p>the GPLv2 was pretty popular at the time, but there were a couple notable loopholes some big corporations had been taking advantage of, which the free software people wanted to close.
a whole bunch of people thought the GPLv2 was fine the way it was, though - closing the loopholes as aggressively as the GPLv3 did cut off some justifiable security measures, and some people said that it could do more harm than good.
the linux kernel, along with a lot more stuff, declared it was sticking with the GPLv2 and not moving to the GPLv3.
when your movement says “here is the new version of The Right Way To Do Things” and several of your largest adherents say “nah fuck you we’re going with the old version” that is not a good sign.
around the same time, free software organizations were starting to successfully sue companies who were using free software but not complying with the license.
so big companies, like Apple, saw new restrictions coming in at the same time as more aggressive enforcement, and said “well shit, we want to base our software on these handy convenient tools like GCC but we can’t use GPLv3 software while keeping our hardware and software as locked together as we’d like.”
so they started pouring money into a new C compiler, LLVM, that was instead open source.</p>

<p>and LLVM became at least as good as GCC, and a less risky decision for big companies, and easier to use to build new languages.
so the free software movement’s last technical advantage was gone.
its social advantages also kinda went up in flames with the GPLv3, too: the software that was the foundation for the GPL enforcement lawsuits stuck with the GPLv2.
the discourse over that decision was so nasty that the lead maintainer (Rob Landley; he’ll come up later) started an identical project which he wound up relicensing under an open source license because the lawsuits had completely backfired: instead of complying with the terms of the GPL, companies were just avoiding GPL software.</p>

<p>the free software movement, in the end, burned itself out, by fighting for a tiny crumb of success and then turning around and lighting that success on fire.
the death of free software tells us that we can’t use a license to trick corporations into sharing our values: they want to profit, and if good software has a license that puts a limit on how much they can do that, they’ll put more resources into writing their own alternative than they would spend complying with the license in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="openness">openness</h2>

<p>the open source movement manages to share the same short term goals as the free software movement but be bad in almost entirely disjoint ways.
the <a href="https://opensource.org/about">mission of the Open Source Initiative</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source enables a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process.
The promise of open source is higher quality, better reliability, greater flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this is so profoundly different from the free software definition that it’s almost comical.
where free software says “we value freedom, which we define in these ways,” open source says “your code will get better.”
the free software movement was prepared to start fights with corporations that used their work but didn’t play by their rules.
the open source movement was invented to be a friendly, apolitical, pro-corporate alternative to the free software movement.</p>

<p>the contrast between “use free software because it preserves your freedom” and “use open source software because it’s better” is profound and honestly a little disappointing to revisit this explicitly.
free software preserves freedoms i don’t need or care about as a user, but it does at least do that.
open source software is frequently not in fact better than closed source alternatives, and “use open source software because on rare occasions it manages to be almost as good” is an even more underwhelming sales pitch than anything free software can give.</p>

<p>where free software is misguided and quixotic, open source is spineless and centrist.
and as tends to happen with spineless centrism, it has eaten the world.</p>

<h2 id="winning">winning</h2>

<p>if there’s anything corporations love more than rewriting software so it lets them make all the money they can dream of, it’s letting other people do that work for them.
it took a while to take off, because the conservative approach of “keep things closed source” was pretty solidly entrenched in a lot of places, but now even the once conservative holdouts have accepted the gospel of centrism.
corporations have little to nothing to lose by publishing existing source code, and can gain all sorts of unpaid volunteer labor.
if they start a new internal project, important enough that they’re …</p></div></div>

<p>At this time, it is now better for you to write content like a human, with personality, and natural.</p>
<p>If you know a subject well, Google especially can sense that. If you are faking, google can sense that too.</p>
<p>Bing search engine likely has comparable talents. Other <em>search engines don’t even matter anymore</em>, as they (such as Duckduckgo and Yahoo) actually source their results from Bing.</p>
<p>Whereas domain authority was previously calculated by backlinks and social network cues, the algos can now sense from your writing alone, along with a multitude of other cues…if you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>On this subject, here is some light reading for you… <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20200831214216/https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf</a> (E-A-T)</p>

<p>Before, in SEO, you had the burden of building backlinks. Backlinks helped search engines understand the context of your site and it’s possible popularity and authority.</p>

<p>If I spoke to you with no less than 1000 words, you might be annoyed. You would, most likely, be very, annoyed, angered, frustrated, sad.</p>
<p>You get it? The Algorithms practically have emotions now. They don’t want to hear you talk like that either.</p>
<p>They don’t like SEO tricks.</p>
<p>Don’t use them.</p>
<hr>

<p>Unless you really are a popular person, don’t bother. Sure, social network traffic is great. But artificial popularity on a social network (ie, an army of admiring sock puppets talking about you… doesn’t help anymore). Search engines know who’s real and who’s not (mostly).</p>

<p>Now that search engines are smarter, you are officially relieved of the burden of SEO. You can be your best you, and you will now thrive for it.</p>

September 7, 2020 | https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update-with-react-and-typescript | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update-with-react-and-typescript">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
    
    <p>With the introduction of hooks, React got some compelling new instruments – including useReducer, which can be used to implement Model-View-Update within a React component.</p>
    
    <p>While probably intended to "hook up" developers experienced in working with Redux, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer">useReducer</a> at the same time opens the door for implementing The Elm Architecture, aka Model-View-Update (MVU) quickly and pragmatically.</p>
<h2>The Core Idea</h2>
<p>If you don't know what MVU is and want to learn more first, check out my article on <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update">how it works</a>. If you are impatient, I can offer you a shortcut:</p>
<p><img src="https://thomasbandt.com/upload/mvu.png" alt="MVU"></p>
<p>From my perspective, the whole thing's essential idea is to make changes to the state explicit and easy to reason about. That is achieved through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data is flowing uni-directionally.</li>
<li>Having a view that is a function of the state (model).</li>
<li>Having an update function that is the only place where state changes.</li>
<li>Communicating through messages.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is fair to argue that 1. and 2. are already core principles of React itself. However, <code>useReducer</code> adds 3. and 4. to the game.</p>
<h2>A Practical Example</h2>
<p>Without further ado, let's go through it based on a little example, a login form.</p>
<h3>What Are The Requirements?</h3>
<ol>
<li>There are a user name and a password field, and a submit button.</li>
<li>The button must only be enabled when the user name and password are provided.</li>
<li>When the button is clicked, some work shall be done (e.g., validation/network request).</li>
</ol>
<h3>The State</h3>
<pre><code>interface State {
  userName: string;
  password: string;
  isValid: boolean;
}

const initialState: State = {
  userName: "",
  password: "",
  isValid: false,
};
</code></pre>
<p>That's as unspectacular as necessary, as the core information we are working with is defined at a central place. So whenever you want to access the user name or password, you don't need to go to the form itself.</p>
<h3>The Messages</h3>
<pre><code>type UserNameChangedMsg = {
  type: "UserNameChangedMsg";
  userName: string;
};

type PasswordChangedMsg = {
  type: "PasswordChangedMsg";
  password: string;
};

type Msg = UserNameChangedMsg | PasswordChangedMsg;
</code></pre>
<p>While the definition of messages is not as lean as in other languages (in F#, this would have been a three-liner), TypeScript, fortunately, supports <a href="https://mariusschulz.com/articles/tagged-union-types-in-typescript">Tagged Union Types</a>, which do the job.</p>
<h3>The View</h3>
<pre><code>export default function () {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(update, initialState);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="text"
        placeholder="User name"
        defaultValue={state.userName}
        onChange={(e) =&gt;
          dispatch({ type: "UserNameChangedMsg", userName: e.target.value })
        }
      /&gt;
      &lt;input
        type="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        defaultValue={state.password}
        onChange={(e) =&gt;
          dispatch({ type: "PasswordChangedMsg", password: e.target.value })
        }
      /&gt;
      &lt;button disabled={!state.isValid} onClick={() =&gt; signIn(state)}&gt;
        Sign in
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now things are getting more interesting. Let's go through it:</p>
<pre><code>const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(update, initialState);
</code></pre>
<p>There it is, our <code>useReducer</code> hook. Calling it returns two things: The current <code>state</code> and a <code>dispatch</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>state</code> can be used to render the view depending on its properties. For example, as required, the sign-in button is only enabled when <code>state.isValid</code> is set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>dispatch</code> function is used to "fire" messages: Whenever the user changes the user name or the password, the corresponding message is being dispatched. Note that it contains the element's value as its payload, for example, in the case of the password:</p>
<pre><code>onChange={(e) =&gt;
  dispatch({ type: "PasswordChangedMsg", password: e.target.value })
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, two questions come up: What happens when a message is being dispatched? And how does <code>state.isValid</code> ever become true?</p>
<h3>The Update Function</h3>
<pre><code>function validate(state: State): boolean {
  return state.userName.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; state.password.length &gt; 0;
}

function update(state: State, msg: Msg) {
  switch (msg.type) {
    case "UserNameChangedMsg": {
      const newState = { ...state, userName: msg.userName };
      return { ...newState, isValid: validate(newState) };
    }
    case "PasswordChangedMsg": {
      const newState = { ...state, password: msg.password };
      return { ...newState, isValid: validate(newState) };
    }
  }
  return assertUnreachable(msg);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here it is, the U of MVU, our <code>update</code> function. Its signature is defined by the <code>useReducer</code> hook: It accepts the latest known state and a message it is supposed to process.</p>
<p>Based on some magic of the TypeScript compiler, it is possible to switch through the messages based on the discriminant property type, which all of them provide.</p>
<p>Depending on the message type, we now know what should be changed, <code>userName</code> or <code>password</code>, and so we do. We also set the <code>isValid</code> property, which becomes only true when both the user name and the password contain at least one character.</p>
<p>Side note: The whole thing is exhaustive, which is achieved by the little helper function <code>assertUnreachable()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>function assertUnreachable(x: never): never {
  throw new Error("Didn't expect to get here");
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever our tagged union <code>Msg</code> gets a new case, the compiler will notice, and the build will fail â€“ until we add that case to the switch.</p>
<h3>Commands?</h3>
<p>If you already know about MVU, you might have noticed that there are no commands yet. And there won't be any â€“ the <code>useReducer</code> hook doesn't know about the concept of commands. That's why I call it a pragmatic approach.</p>
<p>But that's not the end of the world as it is possible to work around it for most cases. For example, when our sign-in button is enabled and gets clicked, we call another function and pass the current state:</p>
<pre><code>function signIn(state: State) {
  // Do something here ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could validate the credentials, make network requests, or do whatever we like. And if the result would be a change of our state, we could pass the dispatch function and dispatch a message from within here.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The example may seem relatively trivial, even too insignificant to use that MVU approach. But if you chose to go down that route, it will come with all the benefits listed above â€“ even for such a relatively simple component.</p>
<p>And once you follow the pattern in more and more components of your application, you will notice that behavior reasoning will become much more straightforward.</p>
<p>PS: See <a href="https://gist.github.com/aspnetde/93bf9cbbac76b7c36b59015ec47cabdf">here</a> for the complete code of the component.</p>

  <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/014b39cd15c61584a080d634e68a0861129d628b/1a9e4/uploads/bad-names.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In our <a href="https://toolbox.humandeluxe.com/good-business-name/">last article</a> of the Business Naming series, you learned that good company names will make you SMILE – and which successful brands apply these criterias. Now, just applying the five SMILE-criterias to a name is not enough: A good name does not only make you smile, it will also not be a head-SCRATCHer.</p>

<p>So, in this article, you will learn what makes a bad company name – so you can avoid these pitfalls with your own brand. There are 7 deal-breaking points to be aware of, following the handy acronym SCRATCH:</p>

<p><strong>Spelling-challenged</strong>: A name isn’t spelled how it sounds like. in the 2000s, a lot of Tech startups did that to secure domains and look unique. The issue: Just from hearing the name, you couldn’t replicate and spell it correctly, which causes trouble when remembering the the brand. In name brainstorming meetings, this is usually the first idea: “Let’s take a word and spell it differently” – please don’t do that. Famous brands that you know (and probably misspelled at first) include Flickr, Lyft or Houzz. Pro tipp: Ask Siri if she knows your company and see how she spells it.</p>

<p><strong>Copycat</strong> – Remember your last beach vacation? The sun, the smell of fresh coconuts and the beach salesman offering the finest garments from Calvin Kline, Guggi, Dolce &amp; Banana. If your brand name is too close to your competition’s, you will end up not only getting sued by them, but perceived as unoriginal and lame. That’s also true if you think of opening a Burger Queen’s or a Jamie and the Juice.</p>

<p><strong>Restrictive</strong> – You know who has a hard time selling anything else but seafood? Bubba Gump Shrimp Company. If your name is very precise on only one aspect of your business, it will lock you in and limit future growth.</p>

<p><strong>Annoying</strong> – Your brand name should not be indecipherable, forced or cutesy – any kind of leaving out letters, play on words or puns will rather hurt your brand perception than help it.</p>

<p><strong>Tame</strong> – Do you know what “Simple” does? Or “Life”? Or “Tune”? All of these are real brand names, they are short, positive, and totally tame. Avoid names that don’t dare or are not specific enough</p>

<p><strong>Curse of Knowledge</strong> – When you are using subculture references or language for your skate shop or surf school, your audience might really enjoy the insider joke. This curse of knowledge however excludes everyone else, and your brand from growing outside the core demographic.</p>

<p><strong>Hard-to-pronounce</strong> – Again, your name doesn’t need to have any artsy qualities. While something like Cartier or Hermès might work in the luxury sector, their pronunciation does exclude the rest of us. If your name is not obvious or you rely on accents or punctuation, try to find a simpler name.</p>

<p>For good brand names, try to avoid any of these head scratchers. To audit your own brand name, try out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14FR3b-ZmeO32uI_sqLRQTACCnEdwZP8Qgi549R9kmFI/edit#gid=0">Human Deluxe SMILE &amp; SCRATCH Matrix</a> on Google Sheets – it’s free, of course!</p>

    <p>In 2018, I started working at Bloomberg. Things have changed a lot since. I’m not the most junior member in the company anymore and I’ve mentored quite a few new engineers, which has been amazing. It helped me observe how others differ from me, absorb their best practices, and figure out things I’ve unconsciously been doing pretty well.</p>

<p>Yearly work reviews are a good way to condense these lessons I’ve learned.  They’re valuable for pattern matching, too. Only when I zoom out do certain patterns become visible. I can then <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/the-human-log.html">start tracking these patterns consciously</a>.</p>

<p>The broad theme for this year is zooming out and challenging the boundaries. It’s also about zooming in, and adding nuance to the sections from last year. It’s more fun if you’ve <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html">read last year’s review first</a>: You can then diff my growth.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="growing-using-different-ladders-of-abstraction">Growing using different ladders of abstraction</h2>

<p>Entering my second year, I had all the basics in place. I had picked all the low hanging fruit, and my rate of growth slowed down. Not good. The big question in my mind was “How do I grow further?”</p>

<p>There was only so much I could do to improve my coding skills. Most blogs epousing techniques to write cleaner code, repeating yourself, not repeating yourself, etc. are micro-optimisations. Almost none of them would make me instantly impactful.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup></p>

<p>However, I did figure out something insightful. I’m working inside the software development lifecycle, but this lifecycle is part of a bigger lifecycle: the product and infrastructure development lifecycle. I decided to go broader instead of deeper. Surprisingly, the breadth provided more depth to what I knew.</p>

<p>I zoomed out in 3 broad directions: learning what people around me are doing, learning good habits of mind, and acquiring new tools for thought.</p>

<h2 id="learning-what-people-around-me-are-doing">Learning what people around me are doing</h2>

<p>Since we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. In the end it’s a business making money through products. The goal isn’t to write code, it’s to be a profitable business.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Most big companies aren’t doing just one thing, which means there are different paths to making money in the same company. Everyone is on at least one path - if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> Tracking these paths, and the path I’m on was pretty valuable. It helped me see how I matter, and what levers I can pull to become more effective. Sometimes, it’s about making the sales jobs easier, so they can make more sales. Other times, it’s about building a new feature for clients. And some other times, it’s about improving a feature that keeps breaking.</p>

<p>Product managers are the best source for this. They know how the business makes money, who are the clients, and what do clients need.</p>

<p>Over the year, I setup quite a few meetings with everyone on my path. A second benefit this gave me was the context of other’s jobs. It helped me communicate better. Framing things in the right way is powerful.</p>

<p>For example, one conversation helped me appreciate why Sarah in Sales wants a bulk update tool. Some companies have lots of employees, and  updating them one by one is a pain. The code I write would literally ease Sarah’s pain.</p>

<!-- More recently, I got a chance to sit in on a few product scoping meetings between teams. This gave me a lot more appreciation for the job my PM and TLs do. Communication is surprisingly hard, and aligning different teams takes skill. -->

<!-- Force multiplier in team vs force multiplier in the entire chain. -->

<h2 id="learning-good-habits-of-mind">Learning good habits of mind</h2>

<p>Software engineering entails thinking well and making the right decisions. Programming is implementing those decisions.</p>

<p>A habit of mind is something your brain does regularly. This could be thinking of X whenever you see Y happen, or applying thinking tool X to problem Y. In short, habits of mind facilitate better thinking.</p>

<p>I suspected if I learn the general skill, I should be able to apply it better to software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="thinking-well">Thinking Well</h3>

<p>Software engineering is an excellent field to practice thinking well in. The feedback loops are shorter, and gauging correctness doesn’t take too long.</p>

<p>I dived into cognitive science studies. It’s a permanent skill that’s worth exploring - a force multiplier for whatever I end up doing, and pays dividends throughout my life.

It’s compounding, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">and compounding is powerful</a>.</p>

<p>There’s lots of good things that came out of this, which I’ll talk about in a bit. They deserve their own section.</p>

<h3 id="strategies-for-making-day-to-day-more-effective">Strategies for making day-to-day more effective</h3>

<p>The other side of the coin is habits that allow you to think well. It starts with noticing little irritations during the day, inefficiencies in meetings, and then figuring out strategies to avoid them. These strategic improvements are underrated.</p>

<p>You decide what to do, and then let it run on automatic, freeing up the brain to think of more fun stuff. Of course, that’s what a habit is, too.</p>

<p>Some good habits I’ve noticed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Never leave a meeting without making the decision / having a next action</li>
  <li>Decide who is going to get it done. Things without an owner rarely get done.</li>
  <li>Document design decisions made during a project</li>
</ul>

<p>This pattern became visible during the review, so I’m keen to pay attention and collect more strategies next year. Having an excellent scrum master who holds me accountable has helped me get better at following these strategies.</p>



<p>New tools for thought are related to thinking well, but more specific to software engineering. Tools for thought help me think better about specific engineering problems.</p>

<p>I’ve adopted a just-in-time approach to this. I look for new tools only when I get stuck on something, or when I find out my abstractions and design decisions aren’t working well.</p>

<p>For example, I was recently struggling with a domain with lots of complex business logic. Edge cases were the norm, and we wanted to design a system that handles this cleanly. That’s when I read about <a href="https://amzn.to/2FdCYUQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domain Driven Design</a><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25">5</a></sup>. I could instantly put it to practice and make a big difference. Subsequently, I grasped these concepts better. I acquired a new mental model of how to create enterprise software.</p>

<p>The second way I keep learning and acquiring new mental models is via reading what surfaces on Hacker News. They are interesting ideas, some of which I’ve put to practice, but this is a lot less effective than the technique above. The only reason I still do this is to <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#map-and-the-territory">map the territory</a> - it keeps me aware of techniques that exist, so when I face a problem, I know there’s a method that might help.</p>

<p>The final way I acquire better mental models is by learning new diverse languages. The diversity bit is important. Learning yet another dialect of lisp has a lot less benefit than say, learning C++03, a functional programming language, a dynamic typed language, and a lisp. Today, <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J seems interesting</a>, and one I might consider learning. It’s a thinking model I haven’t used before.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten lots of value from doing this. Each language has its own vocabulary and grammar, and <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/vocabulary-mental-model.html">vocabulary is a meta-mental model</a>. It’s a new lens to look at how to do things.</p>

<p>When memory management is in your control, you understand how pointers and allocators work. When Python then abstracts this away, you appreciate the complexity reduction. When maps and filters in a functional language show up, you appreciate how Python’s for loops can be improved. Indeed, that’s what list comprehensions are. And then you notice how some things are easier with object oriented programming. There’s no one magic tool that fits everything well. And then you understand that despite this, you don’t have to switch tools. You can adapt best practices from one into another to solve your problems: like writing functional javascript. It’s the principles that matter more than their expression.</p>

<p>Broadly, that’s all I did this year. What follow are insights that sprang forth thanks to zooming out.</p>

<h2 id="protect-your-slack">Protect your slack</h2>

<p>When I say slack, I don’t mean the company, but the adjective.</p>

<p>One thing that gives me high output and productivity gains is to “slow down”. Want to get more done? Slow down.</p>

<p>Caveats apply, but here’s what I mean:</p>

<p>I’ve noticed people rush to solve problems. It can be something they’ve done before, or something we have a template for. It feels pretty good to smash through things. I’ve done that before, too! However, there’s very specific cases where this makes sense.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Whenever I’m working on something new, I take the time to learn things about the system I’m working on, and things closely related to it. If it’s too massive, I optimise for learning as much as I can. Every time I revisit the system, I aim to learn more.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is slack</a>, you get a chance to experiment, learn, and think things through. This means you get enough time to get things done.</p>

<p>When there is no slack, deadlines are tight, and all your focus goes into getting shit done.</p>

<p>Protecting your slack means not letting deadlines wrap tight around you. Usually, this is as simple (or hard) as communicating.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Slack might have a negative connotation with “slackers”, but protecting slack is a super power. It’s a long term investment into building yourself up at the cost of short term efficiency.</p>

<p>When I’m quickly dishing out stories, I also have a much harder time fixing bugs. I don’t take the time to create proper mental models of the system, which means my assumptions don’t match the code, and this mismatch is where most bugs lie.</p>

<p>I protect my slack, so I can take the time out to prioritise …</p></div></div>

<p>I try to consolidate my MLSS 2020 notes in small blog posts and hope you might also find them interesting. I don’t try to cover the complete lectures but rather pick some pieces that I find important when working or doing research in ML. I anticipate this series of blog posts will range from extremely superficial to excessively detailed for some readers.</p>

<p>I will start with Bernhard Schölkopf’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmJtThWmhA">lecture</a> on Causality (the second part by Stefan Bauer can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DJWJpn0DmU">here</a>) and draw some connections to Moritz Hardt’s presentations (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq_S_7IfOU">1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oNVFQ9llPc">2</a>) on fairness. I also recommend taking a look at Bernhard’s very accessible <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf">monograph</a>.</p>

<h3 id="independence-of-events-and-random-variables">Independence of Events and Random Variables</h3>

<p>Before we start, we define some basic notions. The first one is the statistical <strong>independence of events</strong>. Let’s consider the events “rainy day” $R$ and “choosing Cini Minis as breakfast cereal” $C$ together with their respective probabilities $Pr(\cdot)$. If rain does not influence your cereal choice, and you can’t change the weather by eating Cini Minis, we say the events are <em>independent</em>, and the following equality holds:
$$
Pr(R \cap C) = Pr(R) \cdot Pr(C).
$$
Similarly, we can define the <strong>independence of continuous random variables</strong> $X$ and $Y$. We write
$$
X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y
$$
for independent variables if for their probability density functions $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$ it holds that
$$
f_{X,Y}(x,y) = f_X(x)f_Y(y)
$$
for all $x$ and $y$.</p>

<p>For the next concept, we introduce a third random variable $Z$ on which we can condition $X$ and $Y$. If $X$ and $Y$ and <strong>conditionally independent</strong> given $Z$, we write
$$
(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y) | Z,
$$
and for the joint probability density conditioned on $Z$, it holds that $f_{XY|Z}(x,y|z)=f_X(x|z)f_Y(y|z)$ for all $x$,$y$, and
$z$ such that $f_Z(z)&gt;0$. This simply translates to the fact that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if I know $Z$, knowing $X$ does not tell me anything additional about $Y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is this relevant for causality? The notion of whether or not two random variables are dependent or independent is essential to understand the underlying phenomena that govern this relationship. For example, if we consider the classic example of observing increased stork activity ($X$) and increased birth rate ($Y$), $X$ and $Y$ can depend on each other in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>$X \rightarrow Y$: storks bring babies, or</li>
<li>$Y \rightarrow X$: babies attract storks.</li>
</ol>

<p>If we believe that both causal relationships are nonsensical, there must be a third factor that influences both observations simultaneously, $X$ and $Y$ have a <strong>common cause</strong> $Z$:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$.</p>

<p>The fact that there is an underlying mechanism ($Z$) that explains the observed dependence is also known as the <strong>common cause principle</strong> [<a href="#reichenbach_1956">1</a>]. Importantly, we cannot determine which of the three relationships is the “truth” given observational data alone.</p>

<h3 id="structural-causal-model">Structural Causal Model</h3>

<p>One approach to model such relationships/dependencies is <strong>structural causal models (SCM)</strong> [<a href="#pearl_2009">2</a>], realized as directed acyclic graph (DAG) as shown below. <em>Directed</em> because we have arrows in one direction, rather than “simple” edges. <em>Acyclic</em> because there are no self-references. Vertices are <em>observables</em> (see <a href="#ontol_insta">further down</a> for an analysis of the meaning of vertices with respect to fairness in AI), and arrows represent <em>direct causation</em>.
</p><p><img src="https://christian.bock.ml/SCM.png" alt="drawing" width="50%">
</p>

<p><span><i>Figure 1:</i> Example of a structural causal model with noise variable $U$.</span>
</p>

<p>In the above graph, we say that an observable $X$, modeled as a random variable, is a function<sup><a href="#fn_func">1</a></sup> of its parents $PA$ and exogenic or noise variables $U$:
$$
X_j = f_j(PA_j, U_j), \qquad (j=1, \dots, n).
$$</p>

<p>Importantly, all noise variables $U$ are stochastic and <strong>jointly independent</strong>, which leads to the insight that the functional viewpoint $f_j(PA_j, U_j)$ can represent the general conditional distribution $p(X_j|PA_j)$. If the $U$s were not independent, there has to be another mechanism (which we called $Z$ in the stork example) that causes their dependence, and hence we’d have to add it in the diagram. But since this is not the case, the graph contains all potential factors, and we call it <strong>causally sufficient</strong>.</p>

<p>The functional representation of a node can expressed purely by the noise factors by recursively substituting the parent equations:
$$
X_j = f_j(PA_j, U_j) = f_j(f_k(PA_k, U_k), U_j) = f_j(f_k(f_l(PA_l, U_j), U_k), U_j) = \dots = g_j(U_1, \dots, U_n)
$$
Each $X_j$ is therefore a random variable and we get a joint distribution of $p(X_1, \dots, X_n)$ which we call the <em>observational distribution</em>.</p>

<h4 id="disentangled-factorization-graphical-causal-inference">Disentangled Factorization &amp; Graphical Causal Inference</h4>

<p>If a structural causal model (e.g., a graph $G$ as shown in Figure 1) exists, there exists a factorization of the observational distribution:
$$
p(X_1, \dots, X_n) = \prod_ip(X_i, PA_i).
$$
We call each $p(X_i, PA_i)$ a <em>causal conditional</em> or <em>causal Markov kernel</em>. Note that only conditionals that are exclusively conditioned on their parents are <em>causal</em>; they are statistically independent of non-descendants given the parents (this is the <strong>local causal Markov condition</strong>). We call this factorization <strong>disentangled/causal</strong> if 1. knowing a mechanism $p(X_i,PA_i)$ does not yield any information about another mechanism $p(X_j,PA_j)$ for $i \neq j$, and 2. changing one $p(X_i,PA_i)$ does not change $p(X_j,PA_j)$ for $i \neq j$.</p>

<p>Changing $X_j$, for example by setting it to a constant $X_j=const$, is also called <strong>intervention</strong>. Interventions are key operators in Pearl’s <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causal-models/do-calculus.html">do-calculus</a>, which I will not address here, but this blog post should help you understand the concept.</p>

<p><strong>Graphical Causal Inference</strong>
They key question is now: How can we recover the graph $G$ of an SCM from the observational distribution $p$ (a.k.a the data)? The answer sounds quite simple: We perform conditional independence testing by tracking how the noise information “spreads through the data”. To make a statement about the existence of a causal graph $G$ when we only see data, we have to assume that seeing data is enough to actually make a statement about $G$. This sounds tautological but is called <strong>faithfulness</strong> and can be formalized by writing</p>

<p>$$
(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z)_p \Rightarrow (X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z)_G.
$$
This means that from <em>observed</em> conditional independence, we can <em>deduce</em> the causal relationship of these variables. This, however, is hard to justify for finite data, and we need to make assumptions on the function classes $f_{\bullet}$ (see chapter 6 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10500.pdf">Causality for Machine Learning</a> for details).</p>

<p>That’s all I wanted to say about this topic. As I said, it is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully provides the lingo that helps to understand some of the basic concepts of causality.</p>

<h3 id="span-id-ontol-insta-parallel-to-fairness-in-ai-ontological-instability-of-causal-vertices-observables-span"><span id="ontol_insta"> Parallel to Fairness in AI: Ontological instability of causal vertices/observables </span></h3>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=adnTgaAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Moritz Hardt</a> argued that we have to ask the fundamental question of what a node in a causal graph actually references. What is the ontological entity? He motivated this line of thought by considering the situation in which the job application of a person dressed like a hipster was rejected. There are now two positions we can take:</p>

<ol>
<li>He was rejected because he is a hipster (being a hipster caused the rejection), and</li>
<li>He was rejected because he did not meet the dress code (his clothing caused the rejection).</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first position, there is a <strong>mediator</strong> that conveyed that this person is a hipster (e.g., his clothes), which influenced the decision (left graph in Fig. 2). The second view stresses that being assigned the “hipster” label can be influenced by <strong>confounders</strong> such as clothing (right graph in Fig. 2).</p>

<p><img src="https://christian.bock.ml/hipster_SCM.png" alt="drawing" width="50%">
</p>

<p><span><i>Figure 2:</i> Two possible causal graphs generated by two ontological views.</span>
</p>

<p>The problem that clothing can be seen as either a mediator or a confounder, depending on the ontology that fits your world view best, is pointed out by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bAipNH8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Judea Pearl</a> himself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you surely know by now, mistaking a mediator for a confounder is one of the deadliest sins in causal inference and may lead to the most outrageous error. The latter invites adjustment; the former forbids it. [<a href="#pearl_2018">4</a>]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bigger question is: why can “hipster” even be a node in the first place? What does it reference, and what are its “settings”?
In a more serious, but analogous situation (“she was rejected because of her religion”) we can take the same two views: Education acts as mediator for religion, and both influence the decision, or education is a confounder that determines religion (see <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/eb/r30.pdf">Fairness in Decision-Making - The Causal Explanation Formula</a>). According to Hardt, these competing models are manifestations of the suppressed question of what the “religion” node references in the first place. A similar problem arises from putting “race” in a causal model: <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190610173.001.0001/oso-9780190610173#:~:text=is%20no%20...-,What%20is%20race%3F,the%20biological%20and%20social%20sciences.">What is race?</a></p>

<p>What’s the best way to level managers up that are reporting to you? It’s by understanding their output and working with them to improve it through a continual virtuous cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This idea isn’t new or novel: Andy Grove wrote the equation below in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884">High Output Management</a> way back in 1983 when he was CEO of Intel:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>A manager’s output = the output of their team + the output of the organization under their influence</em></p></blockquote>



<p>I’ve referred to this many times in the past, because it’s the equivalent of <em>e=mc²</em> for managers. Simple, elegant, yet quite groundbreaking. However, previous references in my articles have used the equation within the context of a manager figuring out how best to spend their time and effort with their ICs and peers to maximize their output. However, if you’re managing managers you’re going to have to think about this equation a little differently because of the managerial role that your direct reports have.</p>



<p>Very few managers are ever the complete article (a <em>unicorn</em>). That includes you and I. This is because being a manager involves a great number of different skills, from the technical to the interpersonal, and no one person is maximally perfect at all of them. That’s entirely normal, and as their manager, your responsibility is to help them <em>fill in all of the gaps</em> by working with them to identify their competency level at all of these different skills, then have them seek out opportunities to <em>delegate</em>, <em>collaborate</em> and <em>educate</em> themselves in order to begin their transformation into that mythical unicorn.</p>



<h2>Delegation, collaboration, and education</h2>



<p>These three core activities are what you should expect all of your managers to continually work on, and you can neatly bucket their activities into each of them.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Delegation</strong> is the bread and butter of having their team get their work done. We’ve written about <a href="http://theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/delegation/">delegation in detail previously</a>. This fits into the <em>output of their team</em> part of the management equation.</li><li><strong>Collaboration</strong> is working with their peers in order to maximize the effectiveness of their team’s work, ensuring that efforts are aligned, opportunities are identified, and that work isn’t duplicated. This is the <em>output of the organization that they influence</em> part of the equation.</li><li><strong>Education</strong> involves both self-directed learning (<em>pull</em>) and learning through your coaching relationship with them (<em>push</em>). Improvements here amplify the output in the previous two areas.</li></ul>



<h2>An example: the CTO</h2>



<p>Let’s frame this by thinking about a CTO of a large technology company. They are accountable for running the Engineering department, reporting to the CEO. They have a number of VPs reporting to them running the various divisions of Engineering. Their peers are the other C-level staff, such as the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Chief Product Officer (CPO) and Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) who are accountable for the other departments of the company respectively.</p>



<p>We mentioned above that when managing managers you should be working with them to ensure good delegation, collaboration and education. Let’s think about how the CEO could be working on these areas with the CTO.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Delegation</strong>: It’s likely that the CEO won’t have too much input on the exact technology choices being used to build the product, however they’ll have a vested interest in how they’ve decided to structure their divisions and teams so that the technology strategy is being delegated – and therefore implemented – effectively through their VPs. The CEO will also want to ensure that the CTO is able to delegate all of the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/vp-director-what/">operational</a> work to their layer below so that the CTO has time to work on the current and future <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/vp-director-what/">strategy</a> of the department, rather than needing to get swept into the details of making the trains run on time.</li><li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: An effective Engineering department is nothing without collaboration with the other departments in the company. The CEO will be wanting to ensure that the CTO is regularly collaborating with the CRO in order to understand what current and prospective customers are thinking about the product, to ensure that a close bond exists between the CPO and the product strategy so they can plan and execute it together, and that the go-to-market strategy lead by the CMO properly shines a light on all of the innovation being delivered by Engineering.</li><li><strong>Education</strong>: A tenured CEO will be an experienced leader, so can coach the CTO on leadership skills so they can become better at the two activities above (<em>push</em>). They can help them think through problems, discuss the company strategy, and point them at areas in which they can improve their impact as a leader. Additionally, the CTO will want to invest time in themselves to increase their own skills (<em>pull</em>) by requesting specific coaching support from the CEO or an external coach, by keeping up to date on the latest developments in the industry and by watching talks, by building their network and reading books, and also by occasionally diving deep into high priority or challenging projects within the department to assist in their execution. This in turn allows them to delegate and collaborate better, continuing a virtuous cycle of increasing their output.</li></ul>



<h2>Mapping out a manager’s skills</h2>



<p>So let’s think about how you can apply this technique.</p>



<p>Getting the conversation underway with your managers can take the form of a coaching session that you can run with them individually.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Firstly, you can run through the Andy Grove managerial output equation and show how delegation affects the output of their team, and how collaboration affects the output of those that they influence.</p>



<p>Together you can focus on both their delegation and collaboration in turn and explore how this currently manifests in their work, where it works well, and where it can be improved. Then, once you’ve done that, you can focus on the areas where it can be improved to see how they can do so either via push (i.e. you coach them or get involved yourself) or via pull (i.e. they invest in self-directed learning and initiatives to get there).</p>



<p>You can then form this into a plan to increase their output as a manager as per the equation. If you want it to be more formal, then perhaps try a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-90-Days-Strategies-Expanded/dp/1422188612">30-60-90</a>. This can be a coaching topic that you both revisit regularly in order to measure progress and to identify further areas that you can assist them with.</p>



<p>Simple!</p>



<h2>Helping them form their Voltron</h2>



<p>There are parallels with the concept of filling in gaps with an excellent article by Lara Hogan on forming a <a href="https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/">Manager Voltron</a>. The premise in that article is that if you aren’t getting the support that you need from your own manager, then you can take the problem into your own hands and build a diverse crew around you that enables you to fill the gaps in your own skill set. For example, if you’re not getting the feedback that you need, you can build a network of others in the business that you trust that can give you it without needing to wait, or depend on, your manager.</p>



<p>This too is something that you help your direct report form. For all of the education they can receive via push, it doesn’t necessarily have to come from <em>you</em>. Instead, you can help them <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/your-network-inside-the-business/">build their network</a> in order to surround them with a crew that can be their very own Voltron, allowing them to get the best of both worlds: a manager that is deeply invested in their success, and also a peer network that challenges and elevates them.</p>



<p>So remember: <em>delegation</em>, <em>collaboration</em> and <em>education</em>. You’re responsible for making it happen. And the effects can be transformational.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creating a changelog is a usual task if a new software version is going to be released. It contains all the changes
which were made since the last release and is helpful to remember what has changed in the code and to be able to
inform the users of our code. </p>
<p>In many projects, creating the changelog is a manual process that is often undesired, error-prone, and time-consuming.
This article describes some tools that can help to automate the changelog creation based on the Git history.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some basics.</p>
<h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>
<p><a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic Versioning (SemVer)</a> is a de facto standard for code versioning. It specifies that a
version number always contains these three parts: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MAJOR</strong>: is incremented when you add breaking changes, e.g. an incompatible API change </li>
<li><strong>MINOR</strong>: is incremented when you add backward compatible functionality</li>
<li><strong>PATCH</strong>: is incremented when you add backward compatible bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conventional Commits</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Conventional Commits specification proposes introducing a standardized lightweight convention on top of commit messages.
This convention dovetails with SemVer, asking software developers to describe in commit messages, features, fixes, and breaking changes that they make.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developers tend to write commit messages that <a href="http://whatthecommit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">serve no purpose</a>. Usually, the message does not
describe where changes were made, what was changed, and what was the motivation for making the changes. </p>
<p>So I recommend to write commit messages using the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Commits specification</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;type&gt;[optional scope]: &lt;description&gt;

[optional body]

[optional footer]</code></pre></div>
<p>An example of such a message: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>fix: ABC-123: Caught Promise exception

We did not catch the promise exception thrown by the API call
and therefore we could not show the error message to the user</code></pre></div>
<p>The commit type <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> can take one of these value:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fix:</code> a commit of this type patches a bug in your codebase and correlates with the patch version in semantic versioning</li>
<li><code>feat:</code> a commit of this type introduces a new feature to the codebase and correlates with a minor version in semantic versioning</li>
<li><code>BREAKING CHANGE:</code> a commit that has the text <code>BREAKING CHANGE:</code> at the beginning of its optional body or footer section
introduces a breaking API change and correlates with a major version in semantic versioning. A breaking change can be part of
commits of any type. e.g., a <code>fix:</code>, <code>feat:</code> &amp; <code>chore:</code> types would all be valid, in addition to any other type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types like <code>chore:</code>, <code>docs:</code>, <code>style:</code>, <code>refactor:</code>, <code>perf:</code>, <code>test:</code> are recommended by the
<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular convention</a>. These
types have no implicit effect on semantic versioning and are not part of the conventional commit specification.</p>
<p>I also recommend reading <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Write Good Commit Messages: A Practical Git Guide</a>.</p>
<h2>Auto-Generate Changelog</h2>
<p>Now we can start to automate the changelog creation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://conventionalcommits.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Commits Specification</a> in your repository. We will use <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@commitlint/config-conventional</a> to enforce this via <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git hooks</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard-version</a>, a utility for versioning using SemVer and changelog generation powered by <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Commits</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will demonstrate the usage based on this <a href="https://github.com/Mokkapps/changelog-generator-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demo project</a> which
was initialized running <code>npm init</code> and <code>git init</code>.</p>
<p>The next step is to install <a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">husky</a>, which sets up your <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git hooks</a>:</p>

<p>Then install <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commitlint</a> with a config, which will be used to lint your commit message:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm install @commitlint/{cli,config-conventional}</code></pre></div>
<p>As we are using <code>config-conventional</code> we are automatically following the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular commit convention</a>.</p>
<p>Now we need to tell Husky to run <code>commitlint</code> during the Git commit hook. We can add it to the <code>package.json</code> </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"@commitlint/cli"</span><span>:</span> <span>"latest"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"@commitlint/config-conventional"</span><span>:</span> <span>"latest"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"husky"</span><span>:</span> <span>"latest"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"husky"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"hooks"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>"commit-msg"</span><span>:</span> <span>"commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>alternatively to a <code>.huskyrc</code> file: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>{
  "hooks": {
    "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
  }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, we create a <code>.commitlintrc.json</code> file which extends the rules from <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">config-conventional</a>:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"extends"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"@commitlint/config-conventional"</span><span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Running <code>git commit</code> with an invalid message will now cause an error:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>▶ git commit -m "this commit message is invalid"
husky &gt; commit-msg (node v14.8.0)
⧗   input: this commit message is invalid
✖   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
✖   type may not be empty [type-empty]

✖   found 2 problems, 0 warnings
ⓘ   Get help: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint

husky &gt; commit-msg hook failed (add --no-verify to bypass)</code></pre></div>
<p>and valid commits will work: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>▶ git commit -m "feat: initial feature commit"
[master (root-commit) a87f2ea] feat: initial feature commit
 5 files changed, 1228 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .commitlintrc.json
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 index.js
 create mode 100644 package-lock.json
 create mode 100644 package.json</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we are safe and can guarantee that only valid commit messages are in our repository. </p>
<h2>Generate Changelog</h2>
<p>Finally, we can create our changelog from our Git history. First step is to install <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standard-version</a>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npm i --save-dev standard-version</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can create some npm scripts in our <code>package.json</code>: </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"release"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"release:minor"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version --release-as minor"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"release:patch"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version --release-as patch"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"release:major"</span><span>:</span> <span>"standard-version --release-as major"</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The changelog generation can be configured via a <code>.versionrc.json</code> file or placing a <code>standard-version</code> stanza in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p>In our demo we use a <code>.versionrc.json</code> file based on the <a href="https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-config-spec/blob/master/versions/2.1.0/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conventional Changelog Configuration Spec</a>: </p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"types"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"feat"</span><span>,</span> <span>"section"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Features"</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"fix"</span><span>,</span> <span>"section"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Bug Fixes"</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"chore"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"docs"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"style"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"refactor"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"perf"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>{</span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"test"</span><span>,</span> <span>"hidden"</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span>
    <span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"commitUrlFormat"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://github.com/mokkapps/changelog-generator-demo/commits/{{hash}}"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"compareUrlFormat"</span><span>:</span> <span>"https://github.com/mokkapps/changelog-generator-demo/compare/{{previousTag}}...{{currentTag}}"</span>
  <span>}</span>
  </code></pre></div>
<p>An array of <code>type</code> objects represents the explicitly supported commit message types, and whether they should show up in the generated changelog file.
<code>commitUrlFormat</code> is an URL representing a specific commit at a hash and <code>compareUrlFormat</code> is an URL representing the comparison between two git shas.</p>
<p>The first release can be created by running <code>npm run release -- --first-release</code> in the terminal:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>▶ npm run release -- --first-release

&gt; changelog-generator-demo@0.0.0 release /Users/mhoffman/workspace/changelog-generator-demo
&gt; standard-version "--first-release"

✖ skip version bump on first release
✔ created CHANGELOG.md
✔ outputting changes to CHANGELOG.md
✔ committing CHANGELOG.md
✔ tagging release v0.0.0
ℹ Run `git push --follow-tags origin master` to publish</code></pre></div>
<p>An exemplary <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> could look similar to this one:</p>

    </span></p>
<p>What I like is that the changelog is divided by the type of commit, it contains links to the specific commits and link to
the diff of the version.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always edit the auto-generated changelog to make it more readable though. The generated changelog Markdown
text can be pasted into GitHub releases so that it shows up next to each release tag. There are a lot more options in
the tools to customize linting commits or the changelog generation.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For lazy developers like me, an automatic changelog generation is a nice tool that saves me a lot of time. Additionally,
we have better commit messages in our code repository as they follow an established specification. </p>
<p>It needs some time to get used to the commit convention. You could encounter some discussions in your team as all
code contributors need to follow the convention. The Git hook solution should catch the wrong messages as early as possible
but you could also add a guard in your CI/CD pipeline. </p>
<p>In my opinion, it is worth the effort to introduce the Git commit convention and the changelog generation in projects.
We as developers do not need to invest much time &amp; brain capacity for the changelog generation and have a helpful
document where we can look up what has changed between our software releases. Additionally, we can easily share this
with the users of our software so that they also see what they can expect from each new release.</p></div></div>]]>

	<section>
		<p><em>Disclaimer: this blog post was triggered/inspired by an article you can find <a href="https://thehftguy.com/2020/08/26/technical-debt-doesnt-exist/">here</a>. I strongly encourage you to get familiar with it - whatever I put below is built on it as a foundation, so all the kudos go to <strong>The HFT Guy</strong>.</em></p><hr><p>Mental models are extremely powerful thought constructs. They do guide &amp; simplify our reasoning, but they also prime us. Bias us. And when treated as axioms, dangerously narrow down our thinking horizons.</p><p>All of the above applies to the popular concept of <strong>"technical debt" (TD)</strong>. I won't cover its meaning and history (there are tons of online materials on those) - instead, I'd like to focus on why the concept of TD is far less useful than we tend to think and actually quite harmful for our daily work.</p><p>Why so? Mainly because:</p><ol><li>there's no code w/o technical debt - TD is <strong>a "local" maintainability factor</strong> (a multiplier - that can span from very low to extremely high values) for a particular piece of a system; hence it's not separable from good (/healthy) code; consider it an inevitable "property" of any code</li><li>mentally dividing work between "fixing/fighting TD" and "developing features" usually leads to: never doing anything about TD and just going short-cuts all the time (<em>"I'll just do it the quick'n'dirty style, we'll need to refactor all that anyway ... some day"</em>)</li><li>we tend to brand as TD <strong>everything "we don't like at the moment"</strong> (a code written by someone else, a code that uses a library we find passé atm, etc.) - which leads to several types of immature &amp; unprofessional practices and massive wastes ("lava flow" effect, stacking unnecessary abstractions, etc.)</li><li>for the reasons stated above, TD is highly subjective and prone to individual judgment, hence nearly impossible to reliably quantify &amp; measure (regardless of whether you estimate the cost of its reduction or its actual impact on the development process); but it looks like <strong>a great candidate for a universal excuse</strong> (and it's frequently used that way)</li><li>it conveniently puts engineers in "we VS the debt" mode by giving the common enemy (that won't speak up) - some ephemeral "entity" you can stand in opposition to; this detail is important: no-one ever openly admits to the ownership over the TD, it just pops up out of the thin air and hinders the work of poor engineers ...</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, peeling TD out of its name won't make all its negative consequences disappear, right? Naming it explicitly at least makes discussing it (among engineers) easier &amp; (hopefully) more conclusive.</p><p>But maybe there's a better way to tame it? E.g. by ...</p><ul><li>... treating it as something inevitable (as there's no and there'll never be perfect, debt-less code)</li><li>... containing it within component/element/unit boundaries</li><li>... and coming up with a way to "reset" it (once in a while) within those local boundaries?</li></ul><p>I've already written (over four years ago) about some particular concept that can help with that - <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/wiping-the-tech-debt-out-with-immutable-code/"><strong>the immutable code</strong></a>. It may sound weird at first glance, but apparently many companies adopt a similar standpoint:</p><ul><li>they create software with the EXPIRY date (on the level of module/component/piece) and re-create it every few years (because business/scale conditions do change anyway) - as a normal business-as-usual activity</li><li>they optimize not for "perfect architectures" but for future re-writes on the level of module/component/piece (e.g. by enforcing explicit contracts - so after a single component replacement, the whole system doesn't collapse like a house of cards)</li></ul><p>That's (creating with a re-write in mind) actually something I've already covered in <a href="https://no-kill-switch.ghost.io/are-the-software-product-companies-doomed-to-collapse/"><strong>the different post in the past</strong></a>, so feel free to reach there for more details.</p><p>Great! But what if my system wasn't written in a re-write-friendly way? What if there are no explicit contracts, dependencies are out of control, the only units of abstractions are the language's syntactic constructs (a flat list, w/o hierarchy or varying perspectives) and it's not possible to map certain capabilities/duties?</p><p>HA! And now we've reached a conclusion I was looking for - the main pre-requisite to build a future-proof solution with a TAMEABLE technical debt is ... <strong>by doing a deliberate design</strong>. It can be done up-front or in an evolutionary way - the mode doesn't matter that much. The truly crucial elements are:</p><ul><li>capability-driven composition (driven by purpose, function) with explicit boundaries and dependencies</li><li>the ubiquitous language used everywhere</li><li>wide (expressive) but shallow (w/o internal details) contracts treated as a binding promise to all the consumers</li></ul><p>That's also why so many attempts to reduce technical debt by purely technical refactoring (e.g. splitting big classes, harmonizing conventions, simplifying the flow in complicated procedures) are a pure waste w/o any noticeable positive long-term effect.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>After writing &amp; publishing articles for about two years (consistently), Iâ€™ve sort of created a system when it comes to publishing an article. From ideation to hitting the publish button.</p>

<p>Of course, this system is ever-evolving and over the years, Iâ€™ve tried to tweak it to suit my needs. And today, I think it has reached to a point where I can share it with you and allow you to peek into this very â€œsystemâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago, when I started this blog, I was used to writing casually and back then i.e. I was only used to post articles whenever I feel like. But from the previous two years, things have changed. Iâ€™ve started to take it more seriously and started publishing articles quite frequently. Almost daily (of course, with a few exceptions).</p>

<p>You might be asking how Iâ€™ve started writing so much? And where do I get ideas from?</p>

<p>The answer to all these questions is <strong><em>â€œFrom teaching things to myselfâ€�</em></strong>. In a nutshell, whenever Iâ€™m in a situation where I donâ€™t get certain concepts correctly, I would first try to understand the topic thoroughly. And when things get clear for me, I would try to depict the concept in my words. In a way that can make me understand whenever I look upon it next time.</p>

<p>That means I primarily write articles for myself only. And if anyone gets benefitted from my articles, it would be an added bonus!</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-article">Writing the Article</h2>

<p>Next, for writing articles, Iâ€™m using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> because articles are written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and nothing is better than the VS Codeâ€™s built-in support for Markdown in my opinion. To get started with a brand new article, all I need to do is whip up a blank Markdown file and pour my heart out in it. Itâ€™s as simple as that.</p>

<p>To make this even better, I use a VS Code extension called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one">Markdown All in One</a> which add some essential things such as keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview, and more when it comes to Markdown. It saves tonnes of time fiddling around some Markdown quirks.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-the-article">Fixing the Article</h2>

<p>Once the article has been written, I head to <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">grammarly.com</a> and paste in my entire article to check for spelling and grammatical mistakes. And once it detects those errors, it can fix those in a cinch.</p>

<p>On top of this, it also suggests alternative words and removal of unnecessary words which can make the entire reading experience a pleasant one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Back then, I was not very concerned regarding making my articles grammar-correct. But over time, I realised itâ€™s important from the perspective of a reader because Iâ€™m also an avid reader myself. And so the grammar correction step entered into my workflow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now is the time to create a nice social banner for the article. It looks something like so on Twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.amitmerchant.com/images/social-banner-demo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A lot of content creators ignore this but in my opinion, it is a really important thing if youâ€™re posting your articles across different social media platforms. It can make your article stand out because images can grab usersâ€™ attention more quickly than the text.</p>

<p>I use a service called <a href="https://crello.com/">Crello</a> where I create social banners every time I write a new article. The banner contains nothing but the title of the article but alas! in big and attention-grabbing fonts. Itâ€™s all handmade.</p>

<h2 id="publishing-the-article">Publishing the Article</h2>

<p>At this moment, everything is in the place and the article is ready to be published. For publishing the article, all it takes is a simple <code>git push</code> in my case as Iâ€™ve hosted my blog on GitHub Pages and it triggers the new build on every Git push.</p>

<p>Once the code is pushed, it would take 30-45 seconds to make the article live on the holy internet!</p>

<p>And that completes my entire workflow from <em>ideation</em> to <em>publishing an article</em>. Iâ€™ve been following this workflow from the past two years and it has suited me very well and Iâ€™m hoping the continue it for some more time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><p><span>The creator of </span><a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/The-Ultimate-Component-Storage-System/" rel="nofollow">this project</a><span>, APTechnologies, came up with the idea for the storage cabinet by observing that he would run into trouble when organizing his component library. Rather than having to go across the workshop to get each part, he wanted a way to consolidate everything into one place for easy finding. The system works by first having the user search for a part on an adjacent screen, and then the associated bin will light up if the component is found in the system.</span></p><h3 id="toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><a href="#toc-designing-the-cabinet-0"><i></i></a><span>Designing the Cabinet</span></h3><p>The storage solution is comprised of a 35 x 12 grid of drawers, which gives ample space for parts. The drawers are laid out according to the spacing between the LEDs in the strip (30 LEDs/meter). They are meant to be printed individually and then slotted in, plus they come in several different sizes.</p><h3 id="toc-fabrication-1"><a href="#toc-fabrication-1"><i></i></a><span>Fabrication</span></h3><p>Each drawer was 3D-printed on a Prusa Mk2S with PLA filament at a .2mm layer height. In order to minimize filament consumption, wall thicknesses are kept very thin, but even with this savings, 5kg of filament was required to fabricate the parts. There is also a small articulating arm that juts out from the side for the HDMI display.</p><h3 id="toc-software-2"><a href="#toc-software-2"><i></i></a><span>Software</span></h3><p>The primary way to interact with the system is through the terminal, which runs a Python 3 script. It begins by checking the text file for data integrity, where it then gets parsed and loaded into an object. Data is stored in CSV-style fashion, with the ID being the first column, the associated LEDs in the second, and finally the quantity in the third column. All subsequent values are optional and simply loaded by the user when the parts is located. A regex is used to parse the user's request, including searching for a component, changing its quantity, adding a new part, and removing a component.</p><h3 id="toc-electronics-3"><a href="#toc-electronics-3"><i></i></a><span>Electronics</span></h3><p>According to the project's creator, the choice for hardware components was quite straightforward. He used a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B in conjunction with a generic HDMI monitor to show the command line interface. For power delivery, he opted for a simple 5V adapter to power both the Raspberry Pi 4 and NeoPixel strip. Since the Pi outputs 3.3v signals from its GPIO pins, a level-shifter is needed, in this case a 74AHCT125. There is an option to use an Arduino Uno via UART if the NeoPixel strip is too unreliable, since the Arduino Uno can supply stricter timings.</p><h3 id="toc-usage-4"><a href="#toc-usage-4"><i></i></a><span>Usage</span></h3><p><span>To add a new part, the command </span><code>PI&lt;ledn&gt;:PI&lt;ledn+k&gt;, &lt;quantity&gt;[, optional parameters]:add</code><span> is sent, which adds a new component to the library. Other commands such as ID&lt;id number&gt; (search for part by ID) and ID&lt;id number&gt;:rm (remove part with that ID) exist to manage added components in the library.</span></p><h3 id="toc-possible-additions-5"><a href="#toc-possible-additions-5"><i></i></a><span>Possible Additions</span></h3><p>Although the system works well for one place and a small collection of components, it tends to scale poorly when there's a large library or multiple users want to interact with it. One way to solve this issue is to replace the single text file with a relational database such as MySQL, where parts can be stored and indexed in a single table, and other data can be referenced. This gives a very powerful interface for the software to easily search, add, and modify parts without having to read and rewrite the text file constantly.</p></div></section><section></section><div><div><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236"></a><div><p><span><a href="https://www.hackster.io/gatoninja236">Arduino “having11” Guy</a><span></span></span></p><p>18 year-old IoT and embedded systems enthusiast.

<p>There is a huge gap between the benefits of Artificial Intelligence the public is being sold, the benefits of AI which are being marketed to corporate adopters, and the actual motivations of AI researchers.</p>



<ul><li>Tech providers pitch AI as a driver of innovation (self-driving cars) and global good (mitigating global warming).&nbsp; But the B2B case-studies pitched to corporate clients more often pitch AI solutions as <em>better automation, </em>mostly enabling cost-reduction (specifically, reducing human-in-the-loop labor).</li><li>While many AI researchers are motivated by genuine interest in improving the human condition, other motivations diverge — a desire to push the bounds of what we <em>can </em>do, a genuine belief in transhumanism (the desire for AI to replace, or transform into something entirely unrecognizable, humanity), or simply because AI pays bigly.</li></ul>



<p>These drivers — replacing human employment, and perhaps humans themselves — are, to put it mildly — not visions the public has bought into.</p>



<p>But these internal motivations are drowned out by the marketing AI pitch by which AI is sold to the public: “AI will solve [hunger/the environment/war/global warming]”.&nbsp; This leaves the people not “in the know” about AI progress — 99% of the population — not even <em>thinking </em>to use democracy to direct AI research towards a world the (average) person actually wants to live in.</p>



<p>This is not particularly fair.</p>



<p><strong>Marketed AI vs Profitable AI</strong></p>



<p>To the public, the tech giants selling AI solutions (Google, Microsoft, and Apple) pitch visions of AI <em>for good</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The public face of these advertising campaigns is usually brand advertising, perhaps pitching consumers on a software ecosystem (Android, iOS), but rarely selling any specific product.&nbsp; This makes it easy to sell the public a <em>vision </em>of the future in HDR, backed by inspirational hipster soundtracks.</p>



<p>You all know what I’m talking about — you’ve seen them on TV and in movie theaters — but the imagery is so<em> honed, </em>so <em>heroic, </em>that we should look at the pictures anyway.</p>



<p>Google’s AI will do revolutionary things, like fix farming, improve birthday parties, and help us not walk off cliffs:&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jId-kNaiaBP0HNR6FjXXaS3HPKHoVr_tLUjEjjGS5sZ23IF1718IWzLeD719RSqO2Aj6vx3oDgeedE_Yjg5xcdNzl2IC71KP79uS0gUjyHSMEkLI1VALL8iqmwdhWXxTdGN7Qm2j" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft’s AI is safe.&nbsp; You can tell because this man is looking <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai?activetab=pivot1%3aprimaryr5">very thoughtfully</a> into the distance:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JKMsdtPMVmd5PHVOAgCleWpG4WctVm-3rGxiM70Tg0HsmDgdxYysjqjGR_zn0I8SEs-lLQxpOyKqxFI_RioIuGDGUFMillFX4T7IxZPI6jHpNiQ10YWpCoodiWli-Z8IxlRVFxq4" alt=""></figure>



<p>But if that is not enough to convince you, here is a bird:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_NtL_Yy86NCoL4J_2kOpzAObYf9KTQ2D0i98JV4PnuAAE-yCqqAOXv7NGB_BSL8KJ-zBLGuiuqI5-fqmFkXLDVIONHPvvUWY6XWzjKC6D0LRaIVXjixdCWaidceDERUBRz-OyjP0" alt=""></figure>



<p>Microsoft goes into detail on their “AI for Good” page.&nbsp; The testimonials highlight the power of AI as applied to:</p>



<ul><li>Environmental sustainability (image recognition of land use, wildlife tracking, maximizing farm yields)</li><li>Healthcare (dredging through data to find diseases)</li><li>Accessibility (machine translation, text to speech)</li><li>Humanitarian action and Cultural Heritage preservation</li></ul>



<p>Even the Chinese search engine Baidu, not exactly known for their humanitarian work, <a href="https://internetofbusiness.com/baidu-becomes-first-chinese-firm-to-join-us-safe-a-i-consortium/">has joined</a> the OpenAI “safe AI” consortium, which is nominally dedicated to developing and selling only <em>safe </em>AI.</p>



<p>The theme among all these public “good AI” initiatives — the sales pitch to the public — is:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We’re developing advanced AI, but we’re partnering with NGOs, hospitals, and more, to make this AI work <em>for </em>people, not against them.&nbsp; Look at all the good we can do!”</p></blockquote>



<p>This isn’t fake.&nbsp; Microsoft <em>is </em>working with nonprofits, NGOs, and more, to deploy for-the-people AI.&nbsp; But these applications don’t get us closer to the <em>real </em>question:</p>



<p>“What solutions are <em>normal</em> companies <em>actually deploying </em>with AI-as-a-service cloud technology?”</p>



<p>We can peek behind the curtain at Amazon.&nbsp; Amazon’s AWS has been for the last decade synonymous with “the cloud”, and still has a full 50% market share.&nbsp; The bleeding edge of AWS are plug-and-play machine learning and AI tools: Amazon Forecast (machine learning), Amazon Polly (text to speech), Amazon Rekognition (video object recognition), Amazon Comprehend (natural language processing), and more.</p>



<p>And Amazon, alone and refreshingly among tech giants, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3463071/aws-is-ethical-about-ai-but-we-just-don-t-talk-about-it-say-apac-execs.html">doesn’t even pretend</a> to care why their customers use AI:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We certainly don’t want to do evil; everything we’ve released to customers to innovate [helps] to lift the bar on what’s actually happening in the industry. It’s really up to the individual organisation how they use that tech”</p></blockquote>



<p>Amazon sells AI to C-suites, and we know what the hooks are, because the marketing pitches are online.&nbsp; AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/customers/?customer-references-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.publishedDate&amp;customer-references-cards.sort-order=desc&amp;awsf.customer-references-category=category%23ai-ml&amp;awsm.page-customer-references-cards=2">publishes case studies</a> about how their plug-and-play AI and ML solutions are used by customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can look at a typical example <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/dxc/?did=cr_card&amp;trk=cr_card">here</a>, outlining how DXC used AWS’s ML and AI toolkits to improve customer service call center interactions.&nbsp; Fair warning:&nbsp; the full read is catastrophically boring — which is to be expected when AI used not to expand the horizon of what is possible… but instead used to excise human labor from work which is already being done:</p>



<blockquote><p>“DXC has also reduced the lead time to edit and change call flow messaging on its IVR system. With its previous technology, it took two months to make changes to IVR scripts because DXC had to retain a professional voice-over actor and employ a specialized engineer to upload any change. With Amazon Polly, it only takes hours”</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Using Amazon Connect, DXC has been able to automate password resets, so the number of calls that get transferred to an agent has dropped by 30–60 percent.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>DXC anticipates an internal cost reduction of 30–40 percent as a result of implementing Amazon Connect, thanks to increased automation and improved productivity on each call.</p></blockquote>



<p>In total, what did DXC do with its deployed AI solution?&nbsp; AI is being used to:</p>



<ul><li>Replace a voice-over actor</li><li>Eliminate an operations engineer</li><li>Eliminate customer service agents</li></ul>



<p>There’s nothing evil in streamlining operations.&nbsp; But because of the split messaging being used to <em>sell </em>AI research to the public vs to industry — on one hand, visions of environmental sustainability and medical breakthroughs, and on the other hand, the mundane breakthrough of applying a scalpel to a call center’s staffing — the public has little insight (other than nagging discomfort) into automation end-game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complete lack of (organized) public anger or federal AI policy — or even an <em>attempt </em>at a policy — speaks to the success of this doublespeak.</p>



<p><strong>Research motivations</strong></p>



<p>So why are actual engineers and researchers <em>building </em>AI solutions?</p>



<p>I could dredge forums and form theories, but I decided to just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/gz5so7/why_are_you_personally_working_on_ai/">ask on reddit</a>, in a quick and completely unscientific test.&nbsp; Feel free to read all the responses — I’ve tried to aggregate them here and distill them into the four main themes.&nbsp; Weighted by upvotes, here’s the summary:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/DvF1XOwrQOuSnpwX0z5y1YLq3keBLTdqSQqyOKj1FrdmNANo2gVWZXWjHnp282aio1EzBBfWMYNPfof4MKZDdeJoQKe18Znbw0jI-iI2QxmmeVkF-MTWGGOsnF1xAaSlMUCtiilV" alt=""></figure>



<p>Preface: none of these are radical new revelations.&nbsp; They match, in degrees, what you’d find with a more exhaustive dragnet of public statements, blogs, or after liquoring up the academic research mainstream.</p>



<p>Walking down the list:</p>



<p><strong>1. Improving the human condition</strong></p>



<p>A plurality goal is to better the human condition, which is promising.&nbsp; An archetypal response is a vision of a future without work (or at least, without universal work):</p>



<blockquote><p>“I believe the fundamental problem of the human race is that pretty much everyone has to work for us to survive.</p><p>So I want to work on fixing that.”</p></blockquote>



<p>It’s not a vision without controversy — it’s an open question whether people can really live fulfilled lives in a world where they <em>aren’t</em> <em>really needed —</em> but at minimum it’s a vision many could get behind, and is at root predicated in a goal of human dignity.</p>



<p><strong>2. It pays</strong></p>



<p>Close behind are crude economics.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p> “Dat money”</p></blockquote>



<p>I don’t intend to sound negative — capitalism is the lever which moves the world, and in capitalism, money follows value.&nbsp; But as shown by AWS, value can come from either revolutionary invention (delivering novel value), or cost excision (delivering <em>cheaper </em>value).</p>



<p>Either direction pays the bills (and engineers), and few megacorp engineers care to peek behind the curtain at which specific aspect of the AI product delivered to clients pays the bills.</p>



<p><strong>3. Transhumanism</strong></p>



<p>Here’s where the interests of true believers in AI diverge from the mainstream.&nbsp; Top comment:</p>



<blockquote><p>“I don’t really care about modern ML solutions, I am only concerned with AGI. Once we understand the mechanisms behind our own intelligence, we move to the next phase in our species’ evolution. It’s the next paradigm shift. Working on anything else wouldn’t be worth it since the amount of value it brings is so vast.”</p></blockquote>



<p>“I’m in it for the money” is just realism.&nbsp; “A world without work” and “making cheddar” are motivations which appeal to the mainstream, and is at least comprehensible (if frustrating) to those whose jobs are on the line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a> is different.&nbsp; There’s a prevalent (although possibly not majority) philosophy among many AI researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts, that the goal of developing strong (human-level) AI is not a tool <em>for </em>humans, but an end unto itself.&nbsp; The goal is the creation of a grander intelligence beyond our own:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Or, step-by-step:</p>



<ul><li>Humans create AI 1.0 with IQ human + 1</li><li>AI 1.0 creates AI 2.0, which is slightly smarter</li><li>AI 2.0 creates AI 3.0, which is WAY smarter</li><li>AI 3.0 creates AI 4.0, which is incomprehensibly smarter</li></ul>



<p>And whatever comes next… we can’t predict.</p>



<p>This is not a complete summary of transhumanism.&nbsp; There’s a spectrum of goals, and widespread desire for AI which can integrate <em>with</em> humans — think, nanobots in the brain, neural augmentation, or wholesale digital brain uploads.&nbsp; But either way — whether the goal is to retrofit or replace …</p></div></div>

<p>Tax efficient investing means carefully choosing certain investments and determining which accounts to hold them in to reduce to reduce your overall tax bill.  Saving money on taxes allows you to make larger investments and keep more of the returns.  In the long run, due to the power of compounding, this can have a dramatic impact on your overall <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a>.  </p>



<p>When investing, there are things that you can control and things that you cannot control.  One area where you do have control over is your taxes.  One way the wealthy became that way was by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/21/here-are-5-ways-the-super-rich-manage-to-pay-lower-taxes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking advantage of tax laws</a>.    </p>



<p>The impact of tax laws can vary widely based on your unique situation, so it is best to meet with a qualified accountant to help you establish a plan as soon as possible.</p>



<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>

<p>Which investments you hold and how you hold them can have a tremendous impact on your long term returns.  The power of compounding can turn small differences now into large differences when you are older.  There are essentially two concepts to keep in mind here, and they are somewhat related.</p>



<ol><li>Some <em>investments</em> are more tax efficient than others</li><li>Some <em>accounts</em> are more tax friendly than others</li></ol>



<p>Your goal should be to hold your least efficient investments in your most tax efficient accounts.  As an example, you can do short term trading inside of a Roth IRA and totally avoid short term capital gains tax!</p>



<h2>What Makes an Investment Tax Efficient?</h2>



<p>Now that you know that some investments are more tax efficient than others let us look at what makes an investment tax efficient.  Investments that generate capital gains and dividends during the year will be generating a tax liability for you in addition to the income.  The more income that the investment generates the higher the tax liability.  </p>



<p>Alternatively, growth investments will not generate any income until you sell them.  This can allow you flexibility for when to earn the income, thus giving you control over when you pay the tax and how much tax you end up paying.  How long you hold an investment matters.  In general, if you hold an investment for over a year you get a reduced tax bill when you sell it.</p>



<p>Let’s take a closer look at how investments generate income and as a result income tax.</p>



<h3>How Do Investments Generate Tax Liability</h3>



<p>Investments can generate taxable income in several ways.  In general, if you sell an investment for more than you paid for it this is called a capital gain.  You will need to pay tax on the capital gain. Also, any cash flows generated from the investment while you own it are taxable income.</p>



<h4>Types of Investment Income</h4>



<ol><li><strong>Capital Gains </strong>– A capital gain is income you generate when you sell an investment for more than you paid for it.  It is defined as <em>sale price – purchase price = capital gain</em>.  Real estate and certain other assets can be more difficult calculate because deprecation of the original purchase price is allowed.  Investments held for more than 1 year before being sold are taxed as long-term gains and have a top federal rate of 23.8% (versus 40.8% for short-term).   This means you should always hold investments you intend to sell within a year in a tax advantaged account.</li><li><strong>Dividends, Interest and Rent</strong> – These are cash payments that are made you for owning the asset.  Stocks can pay dividends, bonds can pay interest, and real estate can pay you rent.  Dividends that are paid on a stock are taxed at the same rate that the capital gains would be on that stock.  This means that for the first year, you would be responsible for short term rate on the dividends.</li></ol>



<p>This is an important concept for stocks.  Growth stocks pay very little dividends but have a high appreciation rate. Dividend stocks have a more stable rate of appreciation but pay frequent dividends.  This means dividend stocks are more appropriately held in tax advantaged accounts and growth stocks that you intend to hold for more than a year can be held in a taxable account.</p>



<h3>Examples of Investments</h3>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Investment</th><th>Tax Efficiency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Growth Stocks</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend Stocks</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Bonds</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Index ETFs</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>REITs</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Actively Managed Mutual Funds</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Municipal Bonds</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>Securities Held Short Term(&lt; 1 year)</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Crypto</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Examples of Investments</figcaption></figure>



<h2>What are Tax Efficient Accounts?</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="384" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uncle-sam.png?resize=640%2C384&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uncle-sam.png?resize=640%2C384&amp;ssl=1" alt="Uncle Sam" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uncle-sam.png?w=750&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/uncle-sam.png?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Uncle Sam wants you to pay your taxes</figcaption></figure>



<p>Uncle Sam gives you multiple options to hold investments in accounts where you won’t generate any tax liability at all.   The most commons ones are IRAs, 401Ks, Health Savings Accounts and Roth IRAs.  <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/top-9-tax-advantaged-accounts/">Here</a> is a complete list of the tax advantaged accounts available to you.  </p>



<p>Only use a taxable account once you have maxed out your other areas of savings.  Only highly efficient investments should be held in a taxable account.  You will have to pay tax on your gains and dividends here, so you should hold your most efficient investments here.</p>



<h3>Should I Hold Tax Inefficient Investments at All?</h3>



<p>You only have so much money to invest and you should be concerned with the <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a> of your investment choices.  This may make you wonder why you would even invest in a tax inefficient choice to begin with.  </p>



<p>You should not rule out tax inefficient investments, you should just be careful where you hold them.  Many tax inefficient investments can have a good risk adjusted return provided you can mitigate the tax liability inherent with holding them.  Ultimately this will help you with diversification of your investments.  </p>



<h3>Take Advantage of as Many Tax Strategies as Possible</h3>



<p>A rational person should seek to pay the least amount of tax and generate the highest returns on their investments.  You should take advantage of every available way of avoiding taxes that you can.  The implications in any single tax year may not be dramatic, but over the course of your lifetime the power of compounding can turn that reduced tax bill into a fortune.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Tax efficiency should not be your primary concern when choosing an investment, but it should be considered.  Don’t eliminate an investment from consideration just because it has a low tax efficiency, but do hold it in a tax efficient account.  Pay attention to the period of time you expect to hold an investment.  Short term capital gains tax can be avoided completely if you hold the stock in a Roth IRA for example.</p>



<p>Ultimately reducing your tax burden will allow you to keep more money invested and due to the power of compounding it can have a dramatic impact on your long term returns.</p>

<p>It was a warm spring evening in London and David Graeber, an anthropology professor at the LSE, was sitting on a rooftop. Our conversation was transmitted through the Internet because of the global travel ban due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, we did not only talk about the new virus and its consequences for society, politics, and the economy. We took the rare opportunity to discuss most of his published works – from the <em>Fragments of Anarchist Anthropology</em> and <em>Debt</em> to <em>Utopia of Rule</em>s, and his most recent book <em>The Bullshit Jobs</em>. All of which have become even more relevant during the corona-crisis.</p>



<p>Professor Graeber presents himself as an anthropologist and anarchist. However, he will not be happy if you refer to him as an “anarchist anthropologist” because there is no such discipline, which he explained during the conversation. The professor is also an activist. He joined many social movements and protests in the last few decades and is often credited as the author of the unofficial slogan from the Occupy Wall Street movement: We are the 99 percent. But he insists that the slogan – as well as everything else in the movement – was a collective effort.</p>



<p>How can democratic governments use this health crisis to enforce authoritarian measures on their citizens? Why don’t the health and care workers strike, during the pandemic, for higher wages? What would happen if we closed Wall Street for a few months? Why do we only see flying cars as special effects in science fiction movies? How can anarchistic principles bring order into chaos during the crisis? Why do we not want to depend on the Chinese and US armies to save our planet?</p>



<p>And finally – how can a drunken rant become a best-selling book?</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.disenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DG-in-office-IMG_2027.JPG-1-2-768x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="561" height="748" srcset="https://www.disenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DG-in-office-IMG_2027.JPG-1-2-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.disenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DG-in-office-IMG_2027.JPG-1-2-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://www.disenz.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DG-in-office-IMG_2027.JPG-1-2-rotated.jpeg 864w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px"><figcaption>David Graeber in his office</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Everybody seems to be speaking the same language during the coronavirus pandemic – from progressive and conservative governments to ISIS and the anarchists: stay at home, wash your hands, avoid other people … And people have been listening to the officials without much protest. They stayed at home and accepted the new rules. We have not seen anything like this for a long while. What has happened?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there are just not all that many people who are quite crazy enough to ignore medical advice during a pandemic.</p>



<p>It brings to mind the 19<sup>th</sup> century French political thinker Henry Saint-Simon—who might have been the first person to come up with the notion of withering away of the state. He argued that if the state was refounded on scientific basis, eventually it would not need to rely on coercion, and therefore, it wouldn’t even be a state in the contemporary sense of having a monopoly of violence.</p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>



<p>For the same reason, he said, that doctor doesn’t have to threaten to beat you up to convince you to the medicine they prescribe. You know the doctor knows something you don’t know, and you assume the doctor is acting in your best interest. Saint-Simon argued once the state was rationally founded on scientific principles, citizens would act in the same way, and coercive enforcement would become unnecessary. Maybe they’d be a few nutty people who refuse to take their medicine but not enough to make much difference.</p>



<p>Obviously this was all very optimistic and naive—that’s why Marx dismissed people like Saint Simon as “utopian socialists”. But there are certain branches of the government that still claim to operate on such basis. And one could make the argument that they’re not by their nature part of government at all.</p>



<p>During the student movement in the UK in 2010 we talked about this a lot, we were mostly anarchists, but we believed in a public health system, and a public university system. Was this hypocritical? None of us felt it was, but we talked a lot about why. Perhaps the problem is that states don’t allow the existence of public institutions – that is, ones which are both universal and non-profit-oriented – that they don’t control. That doesn’t mean those institutions are somehow of the same nature as the army, or prison system, which are entirely creatures of the state.</p>



<blockquote><p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Yes and of course Foucault would say the authority that does not need a violent force to enforce itself is the scariest kind of all.</strong></p>



<p>He would. Though I think Foucault is often misinterpreted in this regard, to assume that any truth discourse is a form of power, and every form of power is violent and objectionable in itself. True, he sometimes sounds as if that’s what he’s saying. But if specifically challenged, he’d always say, no, no, obviously not.</p>



<p>The idea that knowledge is always a form of power is very flattering to academics, who have a great deal of one and very little of the other, so it’s hardly surprising they like it so much. Foucault himself had his own immediate concerns – he was diagnosed as a homosexual in his youth, and wanted to understand how it came about that his most intimate desires could be considered a disease.</p>



<p>He effectively dedicated his life to trying to understand that. But many on the academic left forget that, such diagnoses were not just abstractions, they ultimately relied on force of law, on the threat of physical violence, even if the doctor isn’t personally carrying a gun. A kind of vulgar Foucauldianismn has encouraged us to overlook how much the threat of force really does still lurk behind most of the institutions he describes.</p>



<p>The Panopticon was a prison after all. Normally if you think someone might be staring at you at any moment, you just go someplace else. Actually things have gotten rather worse in that respect since Foucault’s time. There didn’t used to be actual armed guards in schools and hospitals; now in many places there are.</p>



<p><strong>Many governments all over the world are using public health to enforce measures that could not have been imaginable in democratic societies only a few months ago. In Slovenia, for example, individuals are fined when they try to protest against the government actions. Not for protesting, of course. That would be undemocratic. But for violating the law on infectious diseases. So the only groups of people that are allowed move freely are the police, the army, and the politicians.</strong></p>



<p>That does not surprise me. You can learn a lot of things about your state by comparing how they treat a political assembly, and any other kind.</p>



<p><strong>In what way?</strong></p>



<p>In liberal democracies, the entire justification for a country’s legal structure is, typically, some kind of ideal of human freedom and liberty. The American bill of rights begins with the freedom of speech, freedom of press, and freedom of assembly. In practice, the assembly of people that gather in order to protest – which is the very essence of what is supposed to be American – is considered <em>less</em> legitimate than an assembly of people who want to sell you something.</p>



<p>You point this out to most middle-class Americans, they seem incredulous. Poor ones not so much, they don’t assume the rules are fair. Anyway: they’ll say “but of course you have the right to assemble, you just need a permit, what’s wrong with that?” So you have to say “all right, if you have to ask police permission to print something, that’s called not having freedom of the press. If you have to ask police permission to say something..” And they’ll say, “but that’s different! There are traffic issues. You can’t just gather. It gets in the way of people walking down the street” Which is funny, because I don’t remember anywhere in the constitution it says anything about the right to unimpeded traffic flow.</p>



<p>We learned that lesson during the Occupy movement. It was startling, after they evicted our camp, how many middle class Americans just shrugged their shoulders when they went on to rip up the Bill of Rights, the very thing they teach their children to be so proud of…</p>



<blockquote><p>The Anonymous movement has shown that you can have meaningful and impactful protests online. And people all across the world are inventing new ways to protest from their home.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>You were trying to occupy a public space?</strong></p>



<p>Any space. After they evicted us from Zuccotti Park, we tried to reestablish a new camp because… well, it was crucial that everyone knew where we were. That was what was so effective about the original occupation: anyone in the city who felt they wanted to get involved knew where they could go and plug in instantly.</p>



<p>At first we thought we could relocate to a huge lot near Wall Street that belong to the Episcopalian Church, they agreed, but huge pressure was place on the Church hierarchy and eventually they reversed themselves. We had a march led by several bishops trying to occupy anyway; the cops beat us up, and the media refused to show any footage of the priests but only anyone in masks to make us look violent and scary.</p>



<p>Then we occupied a park that was open all night and they changed the rules of the park. We then got a legal ruling from a judge that we could sleep on the sidewalk as long as we do not take more than half of it. So the city just passed an order that Lower Manhattan was an emergency zone where legal decisions do not apply. So we decided to occupy the stairs of the building where the Bill of Rights was actually signed, which is right near Wall Street incidentally, but wasn’t under city jurisdiction. We were immediately were surrounded by SWAT teams and after two days they found a way to force us from there.</p>



<p>We tried everything to set up a legal alternative. But the state completely simply shredded the very legal principles that they teach children are what makes them proud to be Americans, and the media didn’t even cover it.</p>



<p><strong>But what can you occupy when you are not allowed to even leave your own apartment?</strong></p>



<p>There are always things you can do. The Anonymous movement has shown that you …</p></div></div>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization">No free lunch theorem</a> states that for any learning algorithm, any improvement on performance over one class of problems is balanced out by a decrease in the performance over another class <a href="#wolpert1997no">(Wolpert &amp; Macready, 1997)</a>. In other words, <strong>there is no “one size fits all” learning algorithm</strong>.</p>

<p>We can see this in practice in the deep learning world. Among the various neural network architectures, each of them are better or worse for solving different tasks based on their inductive biases. For example, consider the image classification problem. CNNs are the de facto choice for processing images and in general data with grid-like topology. Sparse connectivity and parameter sharing in CNNs make them an effective and statistically efficient architecture.</p>

<p>The convolution operation in combination with max pooling makes CNNs approximately invariant to translation.
When a module is translation invariant, it means that if we apply translation transformation on the input image, i.e., change the position of the objects in the input, the output of the module won’t change. In mathematical terms if  is translation invariant, then , where  is a translation function.
A module could also be translation equivariant, which means that any translation in the input will be reflected in the output. In mathematical terms, if  is translation equivariant, then .
The convolution operation is translation equivariant, and applying a pooling operation on top of it results in translation invariance!</p>

</div>

<p>Translation invariance of CNNs improves their generalization and makes them data efficient compared to fully connected networks. For example, if, during training, a CNN has only seen pictures of cats where the cat is located at the centre of the image, it can correctly classify cats at test time independent of their position in the image.  In the lack of this inductive bias, the model needs to see examples of cats at different positions to be able to correctly classify them at test time.
On the other hand, this translation invariance can hurt the performance of CNNs in cases where the position of the objects in the image matters. This is known as the Picasso effect, where you have all the pieces of an object but not in the right context (One of the motivations behind <a href="http://samiraabnar.github.io/articles/2019-03/capsule">CapsNets</a> is to address this drawback).</p>

</div>

<p>Another example of such tradeoffs are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in contrast to Transformers. It has been shown that the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs helps them capture hierarchical structures in sequences (<a href="https://samiraabnar.github.io/articles/2020-05/recurrence">Take a look at my other blog post about the recurrecnt inductive bias</a>). But this recurrence and the fact that RNNs’ access to previous tokens is limited to their memory makes it harder for them to deal with long term dependencies.
Besides, RNNs can be rather slow because they have to process data sequentially, i.e, they are not parallelizable. On the other hand, Transformers have direct access to all input tokens and they are very expressive when it comes to representing longer context sizes. Also, they can process the input sequence in parallel, hence they can be remarkably faster than LSTMs. However, Transformers struggle to generalize on tasks that require capturing hierarchical structures when training data is limited.</p>

<p>It might not be possible to have one model that can single handedly achieve the desired generalization behaviour on a wide range of tasks, but would it be possible to benefit from the inductive biases of different models during training to have one best model at inference?</p>

<p>Fortunately, it seems to be possible to do this to some extent!
In this post, I discuss our paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00555">“Transferring Inductive Biases through Knowledge Distillation”</a>, where we show that it is possible to transfer the effect of inductive bias through knowledge distillation and this can be a step toward achieving the goal of combining the strengths of multiple models in one place.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-inductive-bias">What is Inductive bias?</h4>
<p>Inductive biases are the characteristics of learning algorithms that influence their generalization behaviour, independent of data. They are one of the main driving forces to push learning algorithms toward particular solutions <a href="#mitchell1980need">(Mitchell, 1980)</a>.
In the absence of strong inductive biases, a model can be equally attracted to several local minima on the loss surface; and the converged solution can be arbitrarily affected by random variations, for instance, the initial state or the order of training examples <a href="#sutskever2013importance">(Sutskever et al., 2013; McCoy et al., 2020; Dodge et al., 2020)</a>.</p>

<p>In figure below, we see a schematic example of the paths that different instances of two models with different levels of inductive biases follow on a fitness landscape.<sup id="fnref:3be40dd2"><a href="#fn:3be40dd2">1</a></sup></p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div>
    
        <p><img src="https://samiraabnar.github.io/img/indist_images/inductive_bias_distilation_example_1.png" alt="Oil on canvas. Featuring a cubist portrait."></p><p>A drawing of how inductive biases can affect models' preferences to converge to different local minima. The inductive biases are shown by colored regions (green and yellow) which indicates regions that models prefer to explore.</p>
    
</div>

<p>There are two types of inductive biases: <strong>restricted hypothesis space bias</strong> and <strong>preference bias</strong>. Restricted hypothesis space bias determines the expressively of a model, while preference bias weighs the solutions within the hypothesis space <a href="#Craven1996ExtractingCM">(Craven, 1996)</a>.</p>

<p>From another point of view, as formulated by <a href="#seuncurve">(Seung et al., 1991)</a> we can study models from two aspects:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Whether a solution is realisable for the model, i.e., there is at least one set of weights that leads to the optimal solution.</li>
  <li>Whether a solution is learnable for the model, i.e., it is possible for the model to learn that solution within a reasonable amount of time and computations.</li>
</ol>

<p>In many cases in deep learning, we are dealing with models that have enough expressive power to solve our problems, however, they have different preference biases. Meaning the desired solutions are realisable for all of them, but depending on the task at hand it is more easier for some of them to learn the solutions compared to the others.</p>

<!-- So,once we have the desired solution, we might be able to guid the other models toward that  solution. -->

<h4 id="having-the-right-inductive-bias-matters">Having the Right Inductive Bias Matters</h4>
<p>To understand the effect of inductive biases of a model, we need to take a look at its generalization behaviour.</p>

<p>Let’s walk through the example of LSTMs and Transformers.
When we train these models on language modelling, i.e., predicting the next word in a sequence, they both achieve more or less similar perplexities.
But how can we know which one is learning a more generlizable solution? One way to check the generalizability of language models is to test how well they have learned the syntactic rules of the language and the hierarchical structures of the sentences.
The task of subject-verb agreement is designed for this purpose, i.e., to assess the ability of models to caputre hierchical structure in the language.
In this task, the goal for the model is to predict the number of a masked verb in a given sentence. To do this, the model needs to correctly recognize the subject of the verb in the sentence and the main difficulty is when the verb does not follow the subject immediately and there are one or more agreement attractors<sup id="fnref:f53f52f4"><a href="#fn:f53f52f4">2</a></sup> between the subject and the verb. In the figure below, we see an example for this task.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div>
    
        <p><img src="https://samiraabnar.github.io/img/indist_images/sv_example.png" alt=""></p><p>An example from the subject-verb agreement task</p>
    
</div>

<p>Comparing different instances of LSTMs and Transformers, with different perplexities, we observe that LSTMs have a higher tendency toward solutions that achieve better accuracy on the <a href="https://github.com/TalLinzen/rnn_agreement">subject verb agreement task</a>. We can see that, LSTMs with worse perplexities achieve better accuracies than Transformers with better perplexities.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div>
    
        <p><img src="https://samiraabnar.github.io/img/indist_images/Screenshot%202020-05-22%20at%2021.13.43.png" alt=""></p><p>Accuracy on verb number prediction vs perplexity</p>
    
</div>

<p>Now, let’s go back to the CNN example and see how the inductive bias of CNNs works in practice.
We can view CNNs as MLPs with an inﬁnitely strong prior over their weights, which says that the weights for one hidden unit must be identical to the weights of its neighbor but shifted in space, also that the weights must be zero, except for in the small, spatially contiguous receptive ﬁeld assigned to that hidden unit <a href="#Goodfellow-et-al-2016">(Goodfellow et al., 2016)</a>.
Hence, to measure the effectiveness of the CNNs inductive biases we can compare them to MLPs.
Here you can see the results of training CNNs and MLPs on the MNIST dataset and evaluating them on the translated and scaled version of MNIST from the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/mnist-c">MNIST-C</a> dataset.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div>
    
        <p><img src="https://samiraabnar.github.io/img/indist_images/Screenshot%202020-05-25%20at%2012.16.21.png" alt=""></p><p>Accuracy and Expected Calibration Error (mean$\pm$std over multiple trials) of CNNs and MLPs trained on MNIST and evaluated on MNIST, MNIST-Scaled and MNIST-Translated</p>
    
</div>

<p>As expected, even though the accuracies of MLPs and CNNs are only slightly different on the original MNIST test set, CNNs can generalize much better to the out of distribution test sets that include translated and scaled MNIST examples.</p>

<h4 id="knowledge-distillation-to-the-rescue">Knowledge Distillation to the Rescue</h4>
<p>There are different ways to inject inductive biases into learning algorithms, for instance, through architectural choices, the objective function, curriculum  strategy, or the optimisation regime.
Here, we exploit the power of Knowledge Distillation (KD) to transfer the effect of inductive biases between neural networks.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->

        <p><img src="https://samiraabnar.github.io/img/indist_images/inductive_bias_distilation_example_2.png" alt="Oil on canvas. Featuring a cubist portrait."></p><p>A drawing of how inductive biases can be transferred through distillation. The inductive biases are shown by colored regions (green and yellow) which indicates regions that models prefer to explore.</p>
    
</div>

<p>KD refers to the process of transferring knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, where the logits from the teacher are used to train the student. It is best known as an effective method for model compression <a href="#hinton2015distilling">(Hinton et al., 2015)</a> which allows taking advantage of the huge number of parameters during training, without losing the efficiency of a smaller model during inference.
When we have a teacher that performs very well on a given task, using it to train another model can lead to an improved performance in the student …</p></article></div>

<p>Hi All! Today we’re going to talk a bit about testing strategies for Azure Functions. We’ll see how setup our test framework and in another article, we’ll see how to create a build pipeline on Azure DevOps.</p>



<p>As part of my daily job, I’m spending a lot of time working with Azure and Azure Functions. These days I’m also working a lot with <a href="https://www.davideguida.com/how-to-use-azure-durable-entities-to-see-whos-the-strongest-avenger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durable Entities</a>, which open the door to even more scenarios. Anyways, no matter what’s the technology behind, one of the best ways to ensure that our software is reliable is to add automatic tests. And these tests <strong>have to be part of the build pipeline</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, based on my researches so far, we can’t create a Functions Host directly as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.davideguida.com/testing-boundaries-web-api/" target="_blank">we could do</a> for a “regular” WebAPI. What we can do instead is make use of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878" target="_blank">Azure Function Core Tools</a> and manually (aka via code) spin up the host in an XUnit Fixture.</p>



<p>This has the only drawback that when running the tests locally we won’t be able to debug the Function code. However, keep in mind the goal here: we want to test the boundaries of our services by probing the various <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-5003878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Function Triggers</a>. </p>



<h4>And this is a form of <em><a href="https://academic.microsoft.com/topic/24169984/publication/search?q=Black-box%20testing&amp;qe=And(Composite(F.FId%253D24169984)%252CTy%253D%270%27)&amp;f=&amp;orderBy=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Box Testing</a></em><strong>:</strong> we’re not supposed to know what’s inside the box, only how to operate it.</h4>



<p>If we need to debug, we can always run the Function project directly from VS and check the behaviour via Postman (if it’s a REST endpoint). Just sayin’.</p>



<p>Moreover, as stated before, we will be executing those tests in our build pipeline, so debugging is not our primary interest.</p>



<p>Anyways, let’s just into the code! The first thing to do, assuming we already have an <strong>Azure Functions</strong> project, is to create the Test project, add a reference to XUnit and create a <a href="https://xunit.net/docs/shared-context" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fixture</a>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public class AzureFunctionsFixture : IDisposable
{
	private readonly Process _funcHostProcess;	

	public readonly HttpClient Client;

	public AzureFunctionsFixture()
	{		
		var port = /*get this from config*/
		var dotnetExePath = /*get this from config*/
		var functionHostPath = /*get this from config*/		
		var functionAppFolder = /*get this from config*/

		_funcHostProcess = new Process
		{
			StartInfo =
			{
				FileName = dotnetExePath,
				Arguments = $"\"{functionHostPath}\" start -p {port}",
				WorkingDirectory = functionAppFolder
			}
		};
		var success = _funcHostProcess.Start();
		if (!success || _funcHostProcess.HasExited)
			throw new InvalidOperationException("Could not start Azure Functions host.");

		this.Client = new HttpClient();
		this.Client.BaseAddress = new Uri($"http://localhost:{port}");
	}
}</pre>



<p>As you can see, in the cTor we’re reading few values from the configuration:</p>



<ul><li>the path to <em>dotnet.exe</em></li><li>the path to <em>func.dll</em> from the <strong>Azure Functions Core Tools</strong></li><li>the path to our Azure Functions DLL</li><li>the port we want to use to expose the host </li></ul>



<p>The <em>Process</em> class will be basically running something like:</p>



<pre><em>dotnet "%APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\azure-functions-core-tools\bin\func.dll" start -p 7071</em> </pre>



<p>from the <em>bin\Debug</em> (or <em>Release</em>) directory of our Azure Functions project.</p>



<p>We’re also creating and publicly exposing an <em>HttpClient</em>: our tests will be using it to “talk” with the Functions Host. To keep things simple, I’m assuming that we’re using only HTTP Triggers. </p>



<p>As some of you might have noticed, the Fixture class is also implementing <em>IDisposable</em>, to properly dispose of the <em>Process </em>and of the <em>HttpClient</em>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public void Dispose()
{
	this.Client?.Dispose();

	if (null != _funcHostProcess)
	{
		if (!_funcHostProcess.HasExited)
			_funcHostProcess.Kill();

		_funcHostProcess.Dispose();
	}
}</pre>



<p>The next thing to do is to create our test class as usual. Now, it’s quite likely that we might want to split our tests into multiple classes. </p>



<h4>In this case, we have to make sure to not spin up more than one Functions Host. </h4>



<p>Luckily, XUnit comes to the rescue with <em><a href="https://xunit.net/docs/shared-context#collection-fixture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Collection Fixtures</a></em>. All we have to do is to create an empty class and mark it with the <em>CollectionDefinition</em> attribute:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[CollectionDefinition(nameof(AzureFunctionsTestsCollection ))]
public class AzureFunctionsTestsCollection : ICollectionFixture { }</pre>



<p>Now we can decorate our test classes with all the necessary attributes and inject the <em>Fixture</em>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[Collection(nameof(AzureFunctionsTestsCollection))]
[Category("Contract")]
[Trait("Category", "Contract")]
public class TriggerWorkflowTests
{
	private readonly AzureFunctionsFixture _fixture;

	public TriggerWorkflowTests(AzureFunctionsFixture fixture)
	{
		_fixture = fixture;
	}

	[Fact]
	public async Task FooFunc_should_do_something_and_not_fail_miserably()
	{
		var response = await _fixture.Client.GetAsync("api/foo");
		response.IsSuccessStatusCode.Should().BeTrue();
	}
}</pre>



<p>That’s all for today! Next time we’ll push our Azure Functions to the repository and make sure the build pipeline runs fine. Ciao!</p>

When I say “trying”, I really meant I spent some time configuring and using those editors. The ones I spent time using are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, my main, daily editor I use for pretty much almost all projects I work on.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, that I currently use at work to hack on Java codebases.</li>
<li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, that I have been trying mainly in Rust, TOML and Markdown.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">emacs</a>, that I highly hacked around to play on my Haskell and Rust codebases (and YAML / Markdown / TOML too).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs">DOOM Emacs</a>, that I tried when I saw a colleague in a previous company I worked in (I was impressed by the “united” feeling of the UI and by how everything looked so slick). So I gave it a try.</li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>’s take on editors. Same thing, mostly Rust, Haskell, etc.</li>
<li>A bunch of others that I won’t talk about because I quickly stopped using.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this article is to create a temporal “snapshot” of my views on editors and what I think about the current situation. I have been using vim and especially neovim for more than a decade. I need to explain about my current workflow and what I cherish in editing before talking about each editors. Expect a point of view from a neovimer which is looking around at lots of editors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is only a personal workflow / point of view that works well <em>for me right now</em>. It doesn’t mean it will for you and it doesn’t mean a different workflow would be worse.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard layout</h2>
<p>I am French and I’m using a keyboard layout that is made to type very quickly in French and to code. With hindsight, since I type more often in English than in French, maybe I should have picked another keyboard layout, but the coding experience in my keyboard layout is really great, so I stick around.</p>
<p>The keyboard layout is <strong>bépo</strong>. I learned bépo the “recommended” way — i.e.&nbsp;you have to practice <em>typing</em> (« dactylographie » in French). It means that I use all my fingers to type on a keyboard, and that each key on the keyboard is assigned <em>a single finger</em> that will press it. That helps a lot with muscle memory and to reduce wrist pain (my wrists barely move when I type on a keyboard), among other things. The typing speed is a side-effect of being accurate and having good comfort (if you are curious, I’m pretty fast but there are faster people — I type at around 120 to 130 words per minute). Because I think the speed doesn’t matter when programming, I think the most important part to remember here is the comfort: the wrists don’t move and my fingers fly around the keyboard, whatever the speed.</p>
<h2 id="modal-editors">Modal editors</h2>
<p>I think a modal editor is superior, for various reasons. The first one is that I truly <strong>hate</strong> having to use a <em>mouse</em> for something that can be done without having to move around hundred of pixels with your cursor and clicking on buttons. For instance, running an application, on my current machines, is simply typing <code>alt d</code>, the name of the program (I typically use completion, so I never type fully the name of the program) and hit enter. All this without moving my hands from the keyboard. And I do that for programs like <code>firefox</code>, <code>kdenlive</code>, etc. but for terminal applications, I simply type and complete them in my terminal, which I open simply with <code>alt return</code>.</p>
<p>So, using a mouse to move around a cursor in an editor feels like completely suboptimal to me, especially because we write code (i.e.&nbsp;we type on a keyboard) most of the time, so moving around with the mouse implies several back and forth movements between the keyboard and the mouse. Maybe you don’t care and it’s cool to you, but to me, this is truly <em>horror land</em>. I feel <em>very</em> uncomfortable when doing this.</p>
<p>Also, <em>modern editors</em> that are not modal typically make people move by using the arrows keys, which are either far on your keyboard, or — like my keyboard, a 60% home made one — not in direct access and then require a function key to enable them.</p>
<p>So that’s the first reason why I like modal editors. They make a smarter use of your keyboard for simple yet recurrent features, like moving around — e.g.&nbsp;<code>h j k l</code>. The second reason why I like them is because of the facts they have a completely new mode for non-modal editor (i.e.&nbsp;the <em>normal</em> mode), you have a whole keyboard / lots of keys to bind actions to and do lots of things people usually do with the mouse. Being able to split an editor into several buffers, move around the buffers, go at the beginning of the paragraph, search and replace, register actions into macros and replay them, etc. All this without even moving the wrists. The learning curve is steep if you’re used to the mouse, but once you’ve passed the mental barrier, really, and this is a personal opinion, but I truly think that using the mouse again after that feels like handicap to me.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-like-to-move-around">How I like to move around</h2>
<p>When I look at people coding, I see several kind of programmers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ones who move with the arrows or with <code>h j k l</code> in modal editors. You can spot them very easily at how the cursor moves in a document. It typically implies keeping a key pressed until the cursor reach a given row, then pressing another key until the cursor reach a given column and then adjust if they went passed the location they had in mind.</li>
<li>People using the mouse, by clicking at the place they want to put the cursor at.</li>
<li>People using <em>relative numbers</em>. That’s an enhancement of the first group: they typically use relative numbers to know which lines they want to jump to very quickly, so that they don’t have to press the up / down keys for ages until reaching the line they want to. Instead, they look at the number on the lines, press that number, and the direction, and bam, they are on the lines. They then use typical motions from vim like <code>$</code> (go to end of line), <code>f</code> (go to the first occurrence of the next character typed after <code>f</code>, like <code>f(</code> will make your cursor go to the next <code>(</code>), <code>%</code> (go to the matching delimiter) or <code>w</code> (go to the beginning of the next word) / <code>b</code> (go to the beginning of the previous word), etc. to move faster on the same line (it works across lines too).</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that represents 99,9% of what I see people do. Obviously, you will get that I don’t belong to the second set of people… but I don’t really belong to any, actually. How I move is, I guess, convoluted for most people and I know some people won’t understand how it can feel. I use <code>h j k l</code> and all the motions from vim described in the third group (and even more; I full lecture of four hours would be required to explain all of them :D), but it all depends on the <em>distance</em> I need to travel. If my cursor is on a word and I want to move to the beginning of a word located very closely to my cursor on the same line, I’ll simply type <code>www</code> if it’s three words apart (or <code>3w</code> if I’m feeling funny). If the distance is higher, I use a tool called [EasyMotion].</p>
<p>Easymotion really is a wonderful tool. The idea is that it has several modes, depending on the kind of move you want to perform:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>By lines</em>: this mode allows you to jump to any line in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By words</em>: tihs mode allows you to jump to any “word” in the current (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li><em>By characters</em>: when the <em>word</em> mode doesn’t help with jumping to a special operator or character (because it’s not recognized as a word), this mode allows you to jump to any character in the current or (or all open) buffers.</li>
<li>It has other modes but I have never really found useful cases for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way I typically do it is by mapping the three modes to <code>&lt;leader&gt;l</code>, <code>&lt;leader&gt;w&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;leader&gt;c</code> (in my case, <code>&lt;leader&gt;</code> is the <em>space</em> key).</p>
<p>Typing <code>SPC l</code> in my current buffer results in this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_lines.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion lines</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Typing any highlighted character will make my cursor jump to it. The same applies for words, with <code>SPC w</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_words.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion words</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the <em>character</em> mode, after pressing <code>SPC c</code>, I have to press another character (the one I want to jump to). Let’s say we want to jump to a <code>#</code> (which is not part of words): <code>SPC c #</code>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://phaazon.net/media/uploads/easymotion_chars.png" alt=""><figcaption>EasyMotion characters</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This way of moving is not intuitive at first, but once you get used to it… it’s a <em>must have</em>.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-other-modal-candies">All the other modal candies</h2>
<p>Among all the things that I like about modal editing, here is a non-exhaustive list of features I expect to have around my fingers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C-i</code> and <code>C-o</code>: those allows me to jump to something / a file / a place in a buffer and then go back to where I was right before with <code>C-o</code> (read it like <em>out</em>) or go back again with <code>C-i</code> (read it like <em>in</em>).</li>
<li>Macros and registers: those allow me to yank content into different registers (like clipboards) by assigning a single key to paste their content. For instance, I can put a few lines in my <code>t</code> register with <code>"tyi(</code> (“put in the <code>t</code> register the <code>y</code>ank <code>i</code>nside matching <code>(</code>), and paste that content later with <code>"tp</code>. Macros allow more powerful editing control by assigning a key to set of actions with the <code>q</code> keyword (<code>qa</code> will register all the next keystrokes and actions into the <code>a</code> macro). Then simply replay the macro with <code>@a</code>, for instance.</li>
<li>Obviously, all the basic vim motions, like <code>d</code> to delete, <code>y</code> to yank, <code>c</code> to change, <code>t</code> to go to the character right before the one you search, <code>%</code> to go to the other delimiter, etc. And more complex text manipulation, such as “Let’s change what’s inside this function parameter list, delimited by <code>(</code>”: <code>ci(</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would take too much time to list everything, but the main idea is: I need the modal features when editing code.</p>

<p>So let’s talk about the list of editors I mentioned in the preface. The idea is to give <em>my own opinion</em> on those …</p></div></section></div>

                    <p>By Ryan Lambert -- Published September 06, 2020</p><p>PostgreSQL 13 development is coming along nicely, Postgres 13 Beta3 was
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/2060/">released on 8/13/2020</a>.
The Postgres Beta 1 and 2 releases were released in May and June 2020.
One of the features that has my interest in Postgres 13 is the B-Tree deduplication effort.  B-Tree indexes are the default indexing method
in Postgres, and are likely the most-used indexes in production 
environments.
Any improvements to this part of the database are likely to have wide-reaching benefits.
Removing duplication from indexes keeps their physical size smaller,
reduces I/O overhead, and should help keep <code>SELECT</code> queries fast!</p>

<p>This post is part of the series <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2018/06/pg-series-toc"><em>PostgreSQL:  From Idea to Database</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a good summary of the what and how of this improvement
in <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/b-tree-index-deduplication/">Laurenz Albe's post</a> from early in June 2020, presumably using
Pg13 Beta1.  <a href="https://www.highgo.ca/2020/07/06/features-in-pg13-deduplication-in-b-tree-indexes/">Hamid Akhtar's post in July</a>
covered this feature using Pg13 Beta2 and a different approach including
a look at the performance using <code>EXPLAIN</code>.
This post takes yet another look at this improvement using Pg13 Beta3.
I intend to see how well this improvement pans out on a data set I use in production.  For that task my go-to is
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data loaded to Postgres/PostGIS <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.</p>
<h2>Install Postgres 13 Beta 3</h2>
<p>The first step is to install the two versions of Postgres (12 and 13beta3) 
on a single Ubuntu 18 host.  In the past when I have tested pre-production
releases I have built Postgres from source instead of using <code>apt</code>.
This time around I decided to use <code>apt install</code>, so am including the
basic process for that.</p>
<p>The advised way to install PostgreSQL is from the pgdg (PostgreSQL Global Development Group) repositories,
see <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">the Postgres wiki</a> for more.
To enable the beta versions, the line needed in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/bionic-pgdg main 13
</code></pre>
<p>With that in place, update the sources and install Postgres and PostGIS.</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
# Postgres 12
sudo apt install postgresql-12 postgresql-12-postgis-3
# Postgres 13 (Currently Beta)
sudo apt install postgresql-13 postgresql-13-postgis-3
</code></pre>
<p>On Ubuntu, installing multiple versions will create multiple instances running on different ports. The test server I'm using to write this post
currently has three versions of Postgres installed, only two are currently running. Postgres 12 was installed first so "won" the default port of 5432.  Postgres 11 was installed second and was assigned 5433, and Pg13 beta 3 was installed last and was assigned port 5434.  The <code>pg_lsclusters</code> is avaiable on Debian/Ubuntu hosts as part of the wrapper around <code>pg_ctl</code>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u postgres pg_lsclusters
Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file
11  main    5433 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/11/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-11-main.log
12  main    5432 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log
13  main    5434 online postgres /var/lib/postgresql/13/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-13-main.log
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This post does not use Postgres 11 beyond this example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When working with multiple versions installed it is helpful to verify
versions match what you expect them to be.
First, the port 5432 for Postgres 12 version.</p>
<pre><code>psql -d pgosm -p 5432 -c "select version();"

<h2>Create Indexes</h2>
<p>Both versions of Postgres were loaded with the same Colorado OpenStreetMap
data loaded <a href="https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/01/postgis-osm-load-2020">using osm2pgsql</a>.
The osm2pgsql does not create any B-Tree indexes on its own, only the GIST
indexes on geometries.
For this post, we examine B-Tree index sizes created on four columns:
<code>osm_id</code>, <code>highway</code>, <code>waterway</code>, and <code>natural</code>.
Looking at the stats on the <code>public.planet_osm_line</code> table I can make 
a couple guesses where we will and will not see gains based on <code>n_distinct</code>.
I can guess we will not see major gains in the
<code>osm_id</code>, there is only a small amount of duplication in those values.
The other three columns (<code>highway</code>, <code>natural</code> and <code>waterway</code>) have a small number of distinct values
and varying amounts of <code>NULL</code> values.  These three columns would all
be candidates for partial indexes to avoid indexing the <code>NULL</code> values,
thus reducing the size of the created index.
I have hopes to see the benefits in Postgres 13 on these columns, possibly
making the use of partial indexes less frequent.</p>

<h3>Index on <code>osm_id</code></h3>
<p>First up is the <code>osm_id</code> column, a nearly unique set of positive and 
negative values.  The index to create in both versions:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_osm_id ON public.planet_osm_line (osm_id);
</code></pre>
<p>The following query is used throughout to report out index sizes.
The query itself will not be repeated, as only the filter would change.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT ai.schemaname AS s_name, ai.relname AS t_name,
        ai.indexrelname AS index_name,
        pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text)) AS index_size,
        pg_relation_size(quote_ident(ai.schemaname)::text || '.' || quote_ident(ai.indexrelname)::text) AS index_size_bytes
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_all_indexes ai
    WHERE ai.indexrelname LIKE 'ix_osm_line%'
    ORDER BY index_name
;
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the low number of duplicates, it is no surprise that the
show only a tiny reduction in the size.  The reduction
would not be detectable from only the <code>index_size</code> column (in MB), the
<code>index_size_bytes</code> shows the slight reduction in size (29,515,776 bytes vs. 29,384,704 bytes).</p>

<h3>Index on <code>highway</code></h3>
<p>The <code>highway</code> data in the <code>planet_osm_line</code> data is a good example of when
a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-partial.html">partial index</a>
might typically be a good idea to minimize index size.  My hunch (and hope)
is that the de-duplication will make a partial index here a moot point by reducing the size required to index a large number of <code>NULL</code> values.</p>
<p>Create two indexes, one partial covering the non-<code>NULL</code> values and one full
index on the entire table.</p>
<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_partial 
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway)
    WHERE highway IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_osm_line_highway_full
    ON public.planet_osm_line (highway);
</code></pre>
<p>The two indexes in Postgres 12, notice the partial index cuts out about 1/3 of the size from the full index.</p>
<pre><code>â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¬â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”…</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">

      
        <p>Relay is a great GraphQL client side library made by Facebook. It has a <code>Node</code> query which allows you to have a universal endpoint for querying all your endpoints in your GraphQL. Let’s check how we do that, we will use <a href="https://nexusjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Nexus</code></a>, you can use the other GraphQL, but I found <code>Nexus</code> made me really productive.</p>
<p>You can use <code>toGlobalID()</code> and <code>fromGlobalID</code> from <code>graphql-relay</code> package. Then you can stop reading here. But I will use an easier way, which you can adopt for your green field project.</p>
<h2 id="1-Rationale"><a href="#1-Rationale" title="1. Rationale"></a>1. Rationale</h2><p>The benefit of having the <code>node()</code> query on your GraphQL root, is:</p>
<ul>
<li>not only Relay can do the refetch via this <code>node()</code>,</li>
<li>but also you can use this node to query any entity that implements this interface.<ul>
<li>So instead of having separate query for <code>user()</code>, <code>company()</code> and <code>task()</code></li>
<li>you can have this single <code>node()</code> query for getting <code>user</code>, <code>company</code> and <code>task</code> entities, if they all implement the <code>node interfaceType</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-For-the-global-unique-ID"><a href="#2-For-the-global-unique-ID" title="2. For the global unique ID"></a>2. For the global unique ID</h2><p>Firstly, you need to adopt a convention for your id, which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The id of an entity is combined by entity name and the real id.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a <code>user</code>, the id should be <code>user_cyasjkajkas</code>.</li>
<li>If you have a <code>task</code>, the id should be <code>task_asjksakjas-12jh12hj-sakjasjksw</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only you can identify the entity of the object, but also you paved the way for the next step, which is easily identity the incoming query in the GraphQL endpoint without any additional saving in your database.</p>
<p>And via doing this, you remove that unnecessary step for wrapping the id.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ID you have now for each record is already global unique, think about it. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="3-Define-the-ID-mapper-function"><a href="#3-Define-the-ID-mapper-function" title="3. Define the ID mapper function"></a>3. Define the ID mapper function</h2><p>This is for checking the pattern of the id.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> isId = {</span><br><span>  task: <span>(<span>entity: { id: string }</span>) =&gt;</span> entity.id.startsWith(IdPrefix.task),</span><br><span>  user: <span>(<span>entity: { id: string }</span>) =&gt;</span> entity.id.startsWith(IdPrefix.user),</span><br><span>};</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="4-Define-the-Node-type"><a href="#4-Define-the-Node-type" title="4. Define the Node type"></a>4. Define the <code>Node</code> type</h2><p>We need to return the proper GraphQL <code>type</code>, from the <code>id</code>. So the <code>Task</code> and <code>User</code> that we are returning here, should be already defined in your codebase. <code>Nexus</code> can auto-find them, follow the convention if you use the other framework.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>const</span> Node = schema.interfaceType({</span><br><span>  name: <span>"Node"</span>,</span><br><span>  definition(t) {</span><br><span>    t.id(<span>"id"</span>);</span><br><span>    t.resolveType(<span>(<span>entity</span>) =&gt;</span> {</span><br><span>      <span>if</span> (isId.task(entity)) {</span><br><span>        <span>return</span> <span>"Task"</span>;</span><br><span>      } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (isId.user(entity)) {</span><br><span>        <span>return</span> <span>"User"</span>;</span><br><span>      }</span><br><span></span><br><span>      <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;</span><br><span>    });</span><br><span>  },</span><br><span>});</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="4-Define-the-node-query-for-that-type"><a href="#4-Define-the-node-query-for-that-type" title="4. Define the node query for that type"></a>4. Define the <code>node</code> query for that type</h2><p>You are doing the same thing, use the id pattern to retrieve the entity. It will then being used as the backing type for the underneath object type, for example, the result of <code>ctx.db.task.findOne({ where: { id } })</code> is a single task, and it will be used by your GraphQL type <code>Task</code> as the backing type.</p>
<p>And how does the framework now, that we want to resolve <code>Task</code> here, well, you already done that in the previous step.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>schema.extendType({</span><br><span>  type: <span>"Query"</span>,</span><br><span>  definition(t) {</span><br><span>    t.field(<span>"node"</span>, {</span><br><span>      type: Node,</span><br><span>      args: { <span>id</span>: schema.idArg({ <span>required</span>: <span>true</span> }) },</span><br><span>      resolve: <span>(<span>_, args, ctx</span>) =&gt;</span> {</span><br><span>        <span>if</span> (isId.task(args)) {</span><br><span>          <span>return</span> ctx.db.task.findOne({ <span>where</span>: { id } });</span><br><span>        } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (isId.user(args)) {</span><br><span>          <span>return</span> ctx.db.user.findOne({ <span>where</span>: { id } });</span><br><span>        }</span><br><span></span><br><span>        <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;</span><br><span>      },</span><br><span>    });</span><br><span>  },</span><br><span>});</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>BTW, what is that beautiful <code>ctx.db.task.findOne({ where: { id } })</code>? It’s <a href="https://www.prisma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Prisma</code></a>, and modern database access for Typescript and Node.js, auto generate all the types and very friendly to use.</p>
<h2 id="5-Now-You-get-the-GraphQL-schema"><a href="#5-Now-You-get-the-GraphQL-schema" title="5. Now You get the GraphQL schema"></a>5. Now You get the GraphQL schema</h2><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>type Query {</span><br><span>  node(id: ID!): Node</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<h2 id="6-The-end"><a href="#6-The-end" title="6. The end"></a>6. The end</h2><p>Hope it helps. Of course, you can argue that the <code>if-else</code> here can be a more functional approach like using <code>cond()</code> from <code>rambda</code>, but I will leave that to you.</p>

              <p>Try to remember the first time you heard about this fascinating language called <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>. Chances are, you had by the time been developing software using Ruby. If that's the case, Elixir seems to have appeared out of nowhere until suddenly, it became the solution for all your previous problems. It is fast, clean, scales extremely well. It was <strong>almost</strong> like the Ruby you've always wanted to have, but never got.</p><p>I say <strong>almost</strong>, because as much as you want it to be, <strong>Elixir is not Ruby</strong>. The familiar syntax has definitely helped the language win the hearts of the broader developer community. Yet, under the hood, <strong>Elixir is all about Erlang.</strong> The <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Erlang</a> that everyone tells stories about, as if it were some mythical creature, but no one dares to touch.</p><figure><img src="https://preslav.me/content/images/2020/09/book-cover.png" alt="" width="500" height="700"><figcaption>Elixir for Non-Ruby Programmers</figcaption></figure><p>Why am I saying all of this? First, because I would love to see greater adoption of Elixir outside Ruby/Rails community. It was among that group of people where the idea first sparked, and I fully respect the fact. Nevertheless, I would love to see it growing out. As someone who discovered Elixir after years of doing Java, &nbsp;.NET and more recently, Go, I can say that there is enough goodness in it for everyone. Moreover, bringing people with different backgrounds (both technical and non-technical) will lead to an explosion of new ideas. Having more diverse minds will help us better understand and make use of the elephant in the room-Erlang.</p><p>This brings me to my second point. Erlang is not obscure at all, once you give it enough attention. It is actually oddly satisfying, once you start reading code written in it. I have had my few a-ha moments, when I figured the original inspiration for most constructs in Elixir. The point is, we shouldn't fear Erlang, but try to understand it. This applies both to when things go well, as well as when they go south.</p><p>My biggest hope of all is that by understanding Erlang well enough, the Elixir community will start looking for new uses for it. Uses that go beyond being a scalable replacement for Rails apps. More daring and more ambitious uses, where Erlang's resilience model can prove to be critical for the success of the mission. I'd love to see it used in transportation, space, as well as the domain that started it all- telecommunications.</p><blockquote>“Shoot for the moon.
