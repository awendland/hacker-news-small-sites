<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <div>
                <div><p>I’m a coach to CEOs and leaders to support them on their journey back to aliveness. Last week a client of mine asked what she could do to be a better CEO or leader. And whether I had any tips for her or things she could do. She heard that the best leaders and CEOs get up early and are really focused on self-care and on the business.</p>
<p>I paused, looked at her mischievously and said that I think that’s entirely the wrong question. And that on top of that, I think that there is no such thing as a great CEO or leader. The only thing that does exist in my experience is a powerful and alive human that loves what they are doing and that happens to run a business. And <strong><em>then</em></strong> other people look at them and say “this person is a great CEO!”. Unfortunately, often we get it all twisted and turned upside down when we try to start at that label and reverse engineer from there.</p>
<p>Whenever we start at the conceptual description of a role, it’s a dead end. Whether you try to be a great CEO, a great mother, father, girlfriend, employee, marketing manager or what have you. <em><strong>Even if we succeed, it always leads to disappointment and resentment</strong></em>. That is because when we try to fit into a pre-conceived role, we make ourselves fit into something that is just a mental concept, like that of a CEO. It has little to do with who we are as powerful humans.</p>
<p>Instead, I exclusively coach around bringing every conversation back to the human level. Meaning to ask in different shapes and forms: What makes you come alive? How do you feel powerful and playful? <strong>This is where greatness <em>in hindsight</em> comes from.</strong></p>
<p>So instead of asking yourself “What makes a great leader?” or “What makes a great CEO?”, I want to give you 3 better questions for greatness in hindsight and aliveness today:</p>
<h2>What’s stopping you from doing what’s right in front of you?</h2>
<p>We can get lost in hypotheticals of “what makes a great leader!” easily, but often, that’s just an excuse for focusing on what’s right in front of you. If you take a second to pause at this moment, <strong>I’m sure there’s something right there, right in front of you that you’d love to do. But! That you’re also scared of</strong>. And maybe it’s a completely simple and obvious thing – in fact, it often is. Here’s a list of things I’ve heard about from CEOs just in the last couple of weeks of coaching sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an honest conversation with a director in the company</li>
<li>Buy a piece of equipment for the factory</li>
<li>Take a week of vacation</li>
<li>Start writing a book</li>
<li>Let yourself feel dejected</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not big things. But each of these things, if repeated daily and with attention, is what will turn into greatness over time and have other people say “this person is a great leader!”. But even more importantly, it is what makes us feel alive and excited and we get to work with the simple, scary, obvious thing right in front of us. <strong>And I’m much more interested in aliveness than in greatness.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>What are you feeling most unsure and&nbsp;insecure about?</h2>
<p>I had a client who was the CEO of a popular tech platform. He was an engineer by trade, yet almost every session he told me that the biggest opportunity he saw for his business was to focus more on marketing and sales. And yet, most of the actions he took were focused on building yet better tech and AI features for the business.</p>
<p>When I pointed that out, he vulnerably confessed that he feels so safe and savvy when it came to engineering, yet so stupid and inexperienced when it came to marketing and sales. To me, that was a massive success, since when we find where our insecurity lies, and we allow ourselves to explore it, that’s when we truly uncover our potential for growth and the next steps. The area where we feel masterful already is often one where we’ve explored much of our potential also.</p>
<p>The places in your life that you are drawn to, but feel timid, insecure, and unsure about are often the ones where the most growth waits for us.</p>
<p>Which parts of your life do you feel most insecure about, that you put off often, but also know that it’s something you deeply value? Then begin with giving those parts a tiny bit more oxygen and attention and see what next steps naturally unfold.</p>
<h2>Who do you care most about?</h2>
<p>A bit over 10 years ago, I was a startup founder standing on top of a hill in San Francisco, 20 years old, fresh off the plane from Europe, wide-eyed and excited for my upcoming adventure. Over the following 6 or so years, I went down the rabbit hole of startup life. I faced the deep struggle of startup fundraising that almost put me out on the street homeless. I had to leave the US because of Visa troubles, traveled around the world, had to fire a co-founder, and through all the ups and downs eventually managed to build a business that’s doing north of $20m in revenue today.</p>
<p>When people ask me, what is the one thing I regret not having on my startup journey, I say this: I wish I had a coach. A trusted, grounded, emotionally intuitive person who knows what he’s talking about and has experienced what I have. I often felt deeply alone, miserable, burnt out, elated, excited and so much more. Yet, I wished I’d had a safe place to bring all this to.</p>
<p>On my journey since building that business, eventually moving to live in a Buddhist monastery for close to two years, training as a trauma therapist to learn the skills of deep emotional presencing, I made that my calling. To be that person to the startup founders, leaders, CEOs and creators of the world. To support them and be their coach as they go through life. Nothing has been more fulfilling for me than this. And when I’m in a rut where I wonder “How can I be a great coach?”, I know that that’s not the right question. And instead, a better one I like is to think about how can I support the people I care most about more or better. <strong>This is where I see action, potential, fun and excitement.</strong></p>
<p>I’m guessing that the same is true for you. With the business you’re in or the life you have, <strong>what are the kinds of people you care about the most and that you want to support?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This question can bring us into the here and now very quickly: People that are cold in the wintertime? Children dying of cancer? Leaders that want more confidence? Men that want to have more empathy? When you take out a piece of paper and write that question at the top, you might be surprised by what kinds of answers you come up with. <strong>And you might also be surprised at how quickly you have an idea of what to do next, now that you wrote that down.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>What is your next, one, tiny step?</h2>
<p>I get sucked into attaching myself to big ideas without ever making progress, just like the next person. I’ve been renting the apartment I’m living in for over a year. Although I always thought of this as the most amazing place to ever live in, I barely furnished it in that time. One thing I’ve been dreaming about was to have lots and lots of plants. And yet nothing happened. Then a friend of mine gifted me a plant the size of a drinking cup, I’ve posted a picture of it below.</p>
<p><img src="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-300x225.jpg 300w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-768x576.jpg 768w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://leowid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_6191-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></p>
<p>And from there, suddenly and magically, I felt empowered and encouraged to take more tiny steps, like that one tiny plant to furnish my apartment. Although I have a long way to go, it already feels much more homey and comfortable than before.</p>
<p>It can feel ridiculous to think about taking tiny steps when you’re already a big-shot CEO or when you’re wanting to become one, one day. And yet, I know no better tool at times than to take a step so ridiculously small in the direction that you want to go and to see what happens next. Usually, all the other steps flow from there.</p>
<p><strong>With the big dream you have in front of you, what’s one tiny step, that’s almost ridiculous, that you can take today?</strong></p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>These questions and stories above are designed to help you do one thing only: <strong>to move from the hypothetical, abstract and unhelpfully analytical into the concrete, the here and now</strong>. This is where your power lies in my experience. And it is when true change and transformation can begin.</p>
<p>At the root of it all to me is the question: <strong>How can I come alive as a human and live into my truth?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you really do want to play it big, focus on that last question more than anything, and naturally, all greatness you ever longed for, as a CEO or otherwise leader and human will naturally follow. There are no great CEOs, only people that have come alive.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-10b1bd0a="" data-v-2ae295f5=""><p><em>Herein I share an experienced developer's first foray into a real-world Rust project. It focuses closely on the type system, and the key insights I needed to begin "thinking in Rust". Written for those getting to grips with the language, it will be especially useful if your background isn't functional programming.</em> </p>
<p><em>Although originally conceived as part 2 of 2, this can be read as a standalone entry.

<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-09-Tide-Clock-1.jpg" title="Picture of the completed Tide Clock"></p>
<h2 id="my-first-date-with-rust---know-thy-enemy">My First Date with Rust - Know Thy Enemy</h2>
<p>As a working programmer with several mainstream languages under your belt (eg <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>javascript</code>, <code>python</code>, etc) it's reasonable to expect that after a bit of orientation with quirks and syntax you'll find yourself somewhat productive. If you know Rust you won't be surprised when I say my experience was... humbling. </p>
<p>The last time I felt so dumb was probably more than a decade ago, as a novice programmer teaching myself Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I think that's the point, new paradigms require effort to build a working mental model for. And depending on where you start on the ladder you might have quite a lot of mental rebuilding to do.  </p>
<p>Rust intentionally tries to be "boring". That is to say, its DNA borrows liberally from prior art. If you're familiar with manual memory management (<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Obj-C</code>) you'll probably understand pointers in Rust. If you're familiar with functional languages (<code>Haskell</code>, <code>Elm</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, <code>OCaml</code>) you'll have an immediate start recognising the type system. The reason it aims for boring is because it spends its entire novelty budget on the one unique idea: automatic scope based memory allocation (aka the borrow checker). This is the knockout feature: <strong>the performance of C with the safety of garbage collected languages.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://intorust.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plenty</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">of ink</a> <a href="https://squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has been</a> <a href="https://dev.to/strottos/learn-rust-the-hard-bits-3d26" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">written</a> about ownership and the borrow checker. It follows the most unprecedented feature would have the most said about it. There seems to be a common refrain: "<em>It's really hard at first, but stick with it. You'll see, it changes everything</em>". Sounds suspiciously like Vim or Emacs users (please don't fight me). Is it the promised land or just a severe case of Stockholm syndrome?     </p>
<p>Nevertheless, extensive reading had prepared me to expect a big ol' messy fight with the borrow checker. We did tussle, but it went better than expected. Ironically, after years of <code>C#</code> game development, performance concerns have taught me much of the internal dialogue needed to reason about memory lifetimes: "Is this allocated on the stack or heap? Is this going to create allocation (garbage collection) pressure? Is this copying data or mutating it in place?"</p>
<p>In this sense, when the borrow checker complained I could at least appreciate what it was trying to protect me against. And as to be expected, it may be a while yet before I fully grok lifetimes. Controversially though, "Rust's expressive type system" put up a stiffer fight than I anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="stubbing-toes-on-functional-programming">Stubbing Toes on Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Before anyone grabs a pitchfork, this isn't a rant about the unnecessary burden of type systems. Throughout my career, I've favoured statically and strongly typed programming languages. I believe in correctness, and tooling should help you get there. It's why Rust excites me.</p>
<p>Taken to its ultimate conclusion, one arrives at <code>Haskell</code> and other pure functional programming (FP) languages. FP's conceit is trading performance for correctness. As a concerned game developer, this never felt like a bargain I could entertain. Not that it's prevented FP idioms from seeping into the groundwater of other programming languages (see <code>LINQ</code> in <code>C#</code> or <code>map() filter() reduce()</code> in <code>javascript</code> as examples).   </p>
<p>You can see signs of this functional DNA written all over Rust too, immutability by default being the most obvious. However, Rust strikes a wonderfully pragmatic balance. Imperative programming is not outlawed, and many escape hatches exist. Rust is, as far as I'm aware, <strong>the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions</strong>. If the borrow checker is the obvious hit single, this is the real album sleeper hit. </p>
<p>I think my undoing was simply that I had a false expectation of equivalence. I'm confident in my type literacy and I can, if we must, talk in-depth about Java design patterns. I've never courted a "proper" functional language, but I recognise their influence. I understood "expressive type system" to be a superset of what I already know. In some respects it is, but in others, it was fundamentally different. I want to share some of my "aha" moments because I haven't seen much written with this lens...  </p>
<h2 id="use-rust-analyzer">Use Rust Analyzer!</h2>
<p>To anyone following my footsteps: <strong>setup your dev environment for code intelligence and type hints</strong> is my best advice. I intentionally offer it here before any code samples make you glaze over and miss it.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Rust-Analyser.png" title="Screenshot of Rust Analyser extension in Visual Studio extensions gallery"></p>
<p>At the time of writing (Oct 2020), I found Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension to be the most reliable path. I learnt this only after naively installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Rust</code></a> extension, which provides a front end for both the earlier <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>RLS</code></a> and the more modern <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>. However, in my experience, the native <code>rust-analyzer</code> extension was vastly superior.</p>
<h2 id="taste-testing-rusts-flavour">Taste Testing Rust's Flavour</h2>
<p>If you can express something as a type, the compiler can offer you guarantees about it. An expressive type system allows you to model domains that weren't possible before, often using simpler machinery too. Rust takes this affordance and runs with it. Types are used for everything, and I do mean <strong>everything</strong>. A lot of problems didn't quite make sense until I learnt to recognise them for what they were: type errors. </p>
<p>However, starting out, there are a few obvious differences I'd put into the "quirks" category. They seem foreign and strange, but acclimatisation comes quickly. I'll only briefly touch on them for those who've never seen Rust before. Exhaustive coverage exists in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Rust book</a> and <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-am-a-java-csharp-c-or-cplusplus-dev-time-to-do-some-rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Rust doesn't have <code>classes</code> and only uses <code>structs</code>:</strong>   </p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>  </pre>
<p><em>"Cool cool. Structs are kinda like classes anyway"</em></p>
<p><strong>Methods are defined in <code>impl</code> blocks instead of the <code>struct</code> definition: </strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>,</span> z<span>:</span><span>f32</span><span>)</span><span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
	
		
		<span>MyData</span><span>{</span>
			x<span>,</span>
			y<span>,</span>
			z<span>,</span>
		<span>}</span>
	<span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p> <em>"Okay, separate <code>impl</code> blocks seem like a weird choice. Kinda reminds me of <code>C</code> header files..."</em></p>
<p> Calling methods defined in types is done with a <code>C++</code> like syntax, e.g. <code>Type::method_name()</code>. However, once an instance exists (aka memory has been allocated), members are accessed with regular dot syntax, e.g. <code>instance.method_name()</code>:</p>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
    
    <span>let</span> y <span>=</span> position<span>.</span>y<span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><strong>There's no inheritance. Shared behaviours are defined in <code>Traits</code>.</strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>pub</span> y<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>
    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>trait</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>


<span>impl</span> <span>Drawable</span> <span>for</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
	
	
	
    <span>fn</span> <span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><em>"Okay, so like <code>Trait</code> is just a different way to spell <code>Interface</code>? Gotcha. But no inheritance? That's pretty wild. But composition over inheritance, am I right?"</em></p>
<p>Now that we've implemented the <code>Drawable</code> Trait, we can call its methods on our struct: </p>
<pre><span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

position<span>.</span><span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </pre>
<p>That's enough for now, but know there are other plenty of other commendable <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">type features</a>, some of which we'll discuss later.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-functional-rubber-meets-the-road">Where the Functional Rubber Meets the Road</h2>
<p>Giant monolithic classes are considered a code smell. A signal that responsibilities need to be separated into separate concerns. Still, OOP maintains the feeling of discrete units. Data and behaviour are contained within the cell walls of the class, or at least within the inheritance chain.   </p>
<p>Rust, by comparison, feels inside out, "itty bitty" and piecemeal. What might have been a single class is instead an accumulation of structs and traits, each defining their own narrow window into data and behaviour. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In this talk</a>, the creator of Clojure, another functional language, describes this quality as "ad-hoc polymorphism". Using only what you need, when you need it. This granular approach maximises the immutable surface area, mutability is limited to where it's necessary.   </p>
<p>In the flame wars of "was OOP a giant mistake?", it's debatable whether <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/object-orientation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust allows you to write OOP code</a>. I understand this now not as a wholesale rejection: abstraction and encapsulation remain necessary tools. However, Rust forces you to leave behind features ardents consider harmful, inheritance being the obvious example. Call it "OOP, the good bits" if you will. </p>
<p>Ideas like composition over inheritance or separating data from behaviour have been around for a long time within the OOP world. However, FP encourages new principles, determinism and the avoidance of side effects. Let's look at an example. </p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake">Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake</h3>
<p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null pointer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his billion-dollar mistake</a>. Any programmer knows the misery of finding an error log littered with <code>Null Reference Exception</code>. But <code>null</code> values are fundamental, like the oxygen we breathe. Whenever I tried to contemplate an alternative I suffered a failure of imagination. <em>"No null values? Far out man."</em> </p>
<p>For a while, in prior languages, I attempted to answer this question by initialising variables with a default value instead of <code>null</code>. That worked when the default value meant something, otherwise, it just piped junk data into the system. Still, in successful cases, I began to appreciate the guarantee  it offered. Any downstream code could trust a variable would be valid and not have to muddy itself with unexpected exceptions.</p>
<p>Software is such that, unfortunately, there will always be cases where initialisation or access of a resource fails. FP provides us with a more complete answer here. It …</p></div></div>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>The mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage wrote 26 programs between 1836 and 1841 for the unfinished "Analytical Engine" (AE). The code is embedded implicitly in tables summarizing program traces. In this talk, I present the programming architecture of Babbage’s mechanical computer based on the first code written for the machine. The AE had a processor separate from memory, and worked using a kind of dataflow approach. The stream of arithmetical operations was independent from the stream of memory addresses. Special "combinatorial" cards allowed the processor to execute FOR and WHILE loops. Combinatorial cards also allowed independent looping through the stream of memory addresses. Quite sophisticated computations were possible and illustrate why Babbage talked about the possibility of doing "algebra" with his machine. The programs I will discuss predate by several years the account published by Menabrea in 1842 and translated later by Lady Lovelace with notes of her own.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In 1991, the famous game "Another World" was published for the Commodore Amiga. It achieved cult status mainly for its visionary art style. But also technically it was quite interesting, as it was based on a game-specific bytecode language executed by a virtual machine interpreter. Eric Chahi, the author of "Another World", six years earlier had written the game "Infernal Runner" on the Amstrad CPC. The game, published by the French company Loriciels, was rated fairly mediocre by the press, was rather simple, and also still had some bugs. Nonetheless, the game is cool from a software architectural point of view. Like "Another World", it is largely not written as a conventional Z80 program, but in a specifically designed bytecode language. This language is interpreted by a virtual machine supporting "parallel" execution of up to 255 tasks by a simple multitasking scheduler. This nice concurrency feature enabled a very elegant design of the various enemies and animated game levels. The talk will cover the essentials of this bytecode language, the virtual machine interpreter, and the process scheduler. Some code examples from the game will be shown, as well as a port of the virtual machine to JavaScript to make the game playable in a web browser. The talk tries to also give you some insights into the reverse engineering process and how much fun this was.</p>

<p>Knowing your PO2 goes a long way towards making it safer to go deeper with an oxygen rebreather.  If you want to go pure O2, it can be used to monitor how purged the loop is, and if you want to go a little deeper it can basically turn an O2 rig into a sort of mixed gas rebreather (or a full mixed gas rebreather with proper diluent addition).</p>

<p>In order to conveniently know my PO2, I have <em>purchased</em> O2 sensors.  Having built in temperature compensation and having reliable manufacturing seems like a big plus vs fabricating, assembling, testing, QCing and calibrating my own.</p>



<p>For my first iteration I have started with just two cells.  A third would be easy to add if this works out.</p>

<p>The electronics are going to be split into three parts- the cells/stuff in the counterlung, an electronics box, and a display.  I decided that the only things in the counterlung should be the sensors themselves and a connector.</p>

<p>The “Electronics Box” will house the brains of the operation (an ESP32), and the battery.  Batteries and other flammables will be kept outside of the oxygen rich environment of the rebreather, for obvious reasons.  In the unlikely event of the battery shorting to the cells, hopefully the high impedance of the cells will limit resistive heating or fire.  In the future, a USB port with a cap will be wired in for charging.</p>

Surprisingly this does not seem to create any significant leak paths, although there is always a slight possibility that I will have to eat my words on that someday.</p>

<p>The display will be upgraded to a HUD at some point, but for now it will be wrist mounted.  It displays two PO2 cell readings, a compass heading, and (in the future) the depth.  As you can see in the photo, the top row is “highlighted” to show a problem- the cells are disconnected and are reading a <em>very</em> high PO2.</p>

<p>Reading an off the shelf galvanic O2 cell is dead easy, since the temperature compensation and shunt resistor are built in.  However, the output voltage is fairly low, and so it should not be fed directly into the ADC of a typical micro.  It is possible to read such a voltage (~20mV), but it wastes a good portion of the resolution of the ADC.</p>



<p>For example, the maximum output expected is 2V (representing a PO2 of 2).  With a 5v ADC, we are only ever using 2/3 of the range of the ADC, which effectively limits our resolution of PO2s to 2/3 the resolution of the ADC.</p>



<p>Since these signals are also not amplified or buffered in any way, it seems good to keep them away from the mcu.  I have resolved to put them on an I2C DAC with an internal gain stage, which will let me both maximize resolution and keep the signal wires for the cells short.  To this end, I used an ADS1015 breakout from adafruit.</p>



<p>Since it was on hand, I also threw in an LSM303 to use as an electronic compass.  Since the compass has no “inertia” it has kind of jumpy readings, but doing some smoothing should help to get it to be a little less jittery.  I could also try some compensation for nearby electronics, but they seem to have little effect.  The LSM accelerometer/magnetometer lives in the wrist piece, although I did consider mounting it in the “head”, which would show you body heading, but not necessarily what you are looking at.</p>



<p>The display is the 128×64 OLED featherwing.  Its easy to integrate, and it is fairly compact in terms of “extra space” for unused headers/buttons.</p>

<p>I  headed to the mystical mystic lake to do some testing.  The combination of near zero visibility to start with and a haze of sediment/algae/stuff I don’t want to think about made for a more-or-less night dive like conditions, even with a light, during the day.  However, the little O2 cell reader and compass seemed to behave relatively well.  Most importantly the firmware did not crash, and no water seemed to get in.  Cant wait to test it somewhere actually fun!</p>

<p>Tesla CEO just announced on Twitter that the Full Self-Driving (FSD) package price will go up by $2,000 starting Monday next week. This price hike is going to set the FSD cost at an staggering $10,000.</p>



<p>In the past, Musk has warned that because of the increase in valuation of the FSD software with the passage of time, Tesla owners will have to pay more to enjoy this futuristic technology. </p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319164198241341440" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319164198241341440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/full-self-driving/">Tesla FSD</a> software gains more and more confidence in roaming the city streets, the $10k price tag might seem affordable in the future. And with the advent of Tesla Robotaxis where the car makes money for you in its free time, the cost will be fully justifiable.</p>



<h2>FSD Beta wide-release</h2>



<div>
<div>
<p>During last evening’s Q3 2020 Earnings Call, Elon Musk also said that the wide-release of FSD Beta will start rolling out at the end of this year. Currently, this specific software release is limited to drivers and owners who are deemed ‘safe and responsible’ by Tesla.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> also said that the wide-release of the FSD Beta this year depends on how much safe this update proves itself in the coming weeks and months of testing.</p>
</div>




</div>



<p>In response to some other questions regarding the worldwide release of FSD beta this year, Elon Musk said that it’s a long process to meet all the regulatory approvals and countries like the UK have Right-Hand-Drive cars, that’s also a challenge to meet.</p>



<figure><div>
<amp-twitter width="600" height="480" layout="responsive" data-tweetid="1319159425995857921" data-width="550" data-dnt="true" i-amphtml-layout="responsive"><i-amphtml-sizer></i-amphtml-sizer><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true" placeholder=""><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9’s reliability (way beyond human).</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1319159425995857921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2020</a></blockquote></amp-twitter>
</div></figure>



<p>Musk also agreed to a suggestion that the price change should currently only take effect in the United States. As in Europe and other countries, the Full Self-Driving phenomenon has yet to go through many obstacles that Elon Musk himself described in the above tweet.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given the hype and excitement around yesterday’s FSD Beta limited-release and the upcoming price hike in a few days, Tesla will be able to sell a sizable number of Full Self-Driving packages before Monday.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In your startup’s early days, goal planning is easy, since you have a clear vision of what you want to build. And you have personally validated that vision through close contact with your customers. But, as your start to scale and your startup grows larger, this starts to get difficult. Read this <a href="https://www.kaapi.team/blog/a-simple-idiot-proof-guide-to-goal-setting" target="_blank">great piece by Ankit on the high level</a> mental models needed to define your goals. In this article I build on my experience in multiple high growth startups to focus on the process of setting goals across a 50-100 member organisation.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>The exercise is as important as the goals</strong></h2><p>The first question you might reasonably ask is <em>why do I need to have an ‘exercise’? </em>Because until recently all you did was buy some pizzas and have a spirited debate, why not just do that with your executive team? A quote I love that explains this best:</p><blockquote><em>"Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors." - Elon Musk</em></blockquote><figure id="w-node-8a4c3ef8b215-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc151d61003389cb31a79_vectors%20of%20your%20startup.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>As a refresher, a vector has both a magnitude and a direction and if they aren’t pointing in the same direction they cancel each other out. Dharmesh Shah, who had this conversation with Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-elon-musk-taught-me-growing-business-dharmesh-shah/" target="_blank">goes into a lot more detail</a>.</p><p>The reason you need to have an <em>‘exercise’</em> is because as your organisation grows larger you have a lot more ‘vectors’ from diverse backgrounds and with diverse experiences within your organisation. You as the CXO need to make sure they are aligned in the same direction.</p><p>A good planning exercise makes sure that you set the right goals and choose the right metrics to track them. And more importantly it also ensures that all your employees are 100% aligned on the <em>‘why’</em>. This is important to drive participation and motivation.<strong>‍</strong></p><figure id="w-node-033014d8b68e-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc137d87721cc33afad3f_Goal%20planning%20exercises.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2><strong>Step 1: Challenge&nbsp;your bias</strong>‍</h2><p>This seems rather obvious, but, what you are really doing here is challenging your biases. As a CXO you think you understand best what your customers need. And it is most likely true, what you are really looking for is information that challenges your biases that you gather through:</p><h3>Market Research</h3><p>Always be testing the market, not just once a year, it should be a perpetual process. It will greatly <a href="https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-decrease-the-odds-that-your-startup-fails-e0fc13213792" target="_blank">reduce the odds that your startup will fail</a>. It doesn’t have to be in-depth or a great presentation. It just has to answer these two questions:<em><br>I think my startup is in market ‘X’. Is that true?<br>Is market ‘X’ where I create the maximum value?</em>‍</p><h3>Documentation</h3><p>You should create a culture of documentation and make that documentation accessible to everyone in the startup. There is a treasure trove of information in your meeting minutes, customer interviews and NPS surveys. And it’s not enough that you are documenting your thoughts. This needs to be decentralised. Every salesperson should be noting down insights after a call, and every engineer post a deployment. This will help you answer these questions:<em>‍</em></p><ul role="list"><li>‍<em>I have some assumptions for growth, what are outliers that validate/invalidate my assumptions?</em></li><li><em>Who in my organisation has the most information about or can challenge the assumptions I am making?</em></li></ul><h3>Take inputs from everyone (Yes, every single person)</h3><p>This comes before the OKR (or KPI, KRA), it’s time consuming so you can’t always do it, but I would recommend doing this at least once a year till you grow to &gt; 100 people. This is where you ask your teams to submit the answer to the question: “<em>What do you think the organisation should focus on in the next year/quarter?</em>”. You can do this over a simple Google Form and then open the results to the entire company. There are two things you find out here:<em>‍</em></p><ul role="list"><li>‍<em>Is there something that I’m missing?</em> - This is usually something that’s not urgent but in the long run may hurt like tech debt so I’d pay attention<em>‍</em></li><li><em>What do our employees care about?</em> - This is important so that you can address why you aren’t picking something. And it creates a backlog of ideas</li></ul><p>Btw. It really helps to have a Chief of Staff who among other things <a href="https://medium.com/lightspeed-venture-partners/software-at-your-service-ceo-interview-series-should-i-hire-a-chief-of-staff-dc5fc4274d5f" target="_blank">manages this process</a> and adds another objective layer between your biases and the organisation's priorities.&nbsp;At the end of this you should have a pretty well-formed answer to what you think your goals should be. Your hypotheses are tested against statistical and anecdotal evidence and you are pleased about the inclusive process.&nbsp;</p><p>But, you still have one step left: <em>convincing your executive team</em>.<strong>‍</strong></p><h2><strong>Step 2: Agreeing to a plan and get buy-ins&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Now, I don’t mean to say that your executive team is standing between you and hyper growth. They’re not. They’re the ones who day-to-day are going to be driving your strategy and they need to be convinced (<em>to almost the point of no doubt</em>) that the course we will take as a startup is the correct one. They need to buy in to this collaborative vision.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There is plenty of content to actually run a strategy meeting, you can use a legion of tools and frameworks (below are <a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank">templates from Miro</a>) and I’d recommend getting a masterclass as a facilitator from somewhere like <a href="https://ajsmart.com/masterclass" target="_blank">aj&amp;smart</a>.</p><p>Here are a few things I’ve learnt that help with the process outside of how the meeting is designed.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Talk to everyone individually before the meeting:</strong> I can’t stress this enough, never go into a strategy meeting without knowing the opinion of everyone in the room. Nothing is more damaging than an executive feeling that they aren’t a part of the decision making process. Through your conversations you hear their concerns and either give them context that helps address them or acknowledge that you’ll work to resolve them.</li><li><strong>Send reading material ahead of time:</strong> Your executives are busy, send all the research gathered and the conclusions at least a week in advance. It gives you the time to have individual conversations and gives them the time to form opinions. I’m personally a huge fan of <a href="https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy/" target="_blank">Amazon’s 6-pager memo</a>.</li><li><strong>Don’t brainstorm:</strong> This is an editorial meeting, brainstorming should have happened earlier, you are here to sift through ideas. (read: <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/brainstorming" target="_blank">Managers must be Insane to brainstorm in groups</a>). Working remotely of late I’ve realised this is even more important to remember since it is easy to get lost brainstorming without actually deciding anything.</li><li><strong>90% agreement rule:</strong> There’s theory that suggests <a href="https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa" target="_blank">we spend 90% of our time on the 10% of things we disagree on</a>. So, get the 90% you agree on out of the way first. Every time you come across a disagreement let it be heard but discuss it at the end.</li><li><strong>Agree to disagree and commit</strong>: Again from Amazon, you won’t get agreement on everything but it will save a lot of time. From Jeff Bezos’s letter to shareholders: “<em>Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?</em>” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes.</li></ol><figure id="w-node-266c3bcfa6a5-0252ad77"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc170e6d64d4871a323eb_miro%20templates%20for%20goal%20planning.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2><strong>Step 3: Pedal to the metal</strong></h2><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ed0dc675974b414a3aa5b26/5f8bc11724084b352a4c9874_fast%20and%20furious.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now you can start executing!<br></p><p>You don’t have to do this entire process every time, and your plans will definitely change midway, but it’s still worth it. By doing these three simple things:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Anecdotal and statistical information is collected from across the organisation</li><li>Employees feel ownership of the targets since they contributed to the plan</li><li>Your executive team agrees and commits to their responsibilities<br></li></ol><p>You should be able to increase productivity (<em>Shorter daily standups and KPI reports</em>), get everyone on the same page, and increase the overall morale of your startup. All your vectors are now aligned. Maybe the stars will soon too! Go go.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div></div>]]>

              After 3 months of trying everything I could think of, I give up.
              I don’t think I will ever develop anything for the Google
              ecosystem again. I’m not angry, I’m not doing this out of spite.
              I just don’t think it is worth it to invest any amount of effort
              to build something on a platform that turned out to be so
              unreliable.
            </p>  <h2>Please scroll down to read the latest update.</h2>  <p>
              I started developing my first extension back in 2010, when Apple
              finally decided to implement proper extension support in Safari.
              Exciting times. I spent a weekend writing my first Safari
              Extension, an ad blocker called “Cleaner Facebook”. I must
              confess it was ugly, and by today’s standards, very poorly
              written, but it did the job.
            </p> <p>
              After a few weeks while browsing Facebook using Chrome, the
              annoying ads popped up and I figured that it’ll be worthwhile to
              port it over, so I did. I also made it available to everyone via
              <a href="http://apps.graffino.com/" target="_blank" title="App Development">Graffino’s apps playground.</a></p> <p>
              Months later the due to some policy changes in Chrome, I moved
              to the Chrome Web Store where I made it available for free under
              the name “Cleaner Facebook”.
            </p> <p>
              What happened next was beyond my wildest expectations. It
              quickly gathered around 4.000 users and over the last year it
              surged to 24.000+ users. Whenever I pushed an update, the
              numbers would spike.
            </p> <p>
              I got quite a few offers to sell it, so others could push
              advertising through it. Thing is, I never wanted to make any
              money off it and I felt like I was betraying my users. So, I
              kept it and improved it constantly. It worked so well because I
              needed it to work well, I was using it daily and my users loved
              it. It got a 5 stars rating and over 85 reviews.
            </p> <blockquote>
              Google has been notified that some of your materials allegedly
              infringe upon the trademarks of others.
            </blockquote> <p>
              At the end of May this year, I received an email from Google
              telling me that my extension violated Facebook’s trademark and
              got taken down. There was no information how to solve the issue,
              no way to appeal. Google washed its hands clean and directed all
              inquiries to an automatically generated email address. This
              email address was a black hole that never responded to any of my
              emails.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/bcfd01f.png" alt="Google's notification that they removed Graffino's Ads removal app from the store."> <figcaption>
                The original infringement and taken down notice (shortened).
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              I figured out that the name might be an issue although there
              were
              <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/facebook?hl=en-US" target="_blank">a lot of other extensions</a>
              with the same name in the store. Even so, I changed the name of
              my extension to “Cleaner — for Facebook” and resubmitted it to
              the store where it got placed “In review”.
            </p> <p>
              Over the next weeks I never received any email from the Chrome
              Store other than the initial take down notice. When I logged in
              again, I found my extension was still “Taken down” and the “In
              review” flag gone.
            </p> <p>
              I went on to search for a Developer Support page, but after half
              an hour of searching I found out that there is none. There is no
              support whatsoever for the developer besides Google’s own
              documentation. If you encounter an issue that you can’t solve
              yourself, you’re stranded. There’s no contact info. No one to
              write to.
            </p> <p>
              After getting really frustrated that day, I vented out sending
              out a nasty email to removals@google.com. Not sure it helped.
            </p> <p>
              The next day I poked around and found a support form intended
              for Chrome Web Store users. In my desperation I figured this was
              my only option left.
            </p> <p>
              About a week later, I got my first reply from <em>Google</em>.
              Although it sounded nice, it wasn’t really helpful. Most
              probably due to the fact it was a canned response, totally
              unrelated to my issue.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/a38f41d.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>First canned response</figcaption></figure> <p>
              Later that day, I fired a few other emails, telling them that my
              extension was not under review and the cause for the take down
              was not flagging. I also submitted another message via the
              support form I used before. My requests got closed with a
              <em>“Thanks for your feedback.”</em> canned response.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/c1a157e.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>“Thank you for your feedback” response</figcaption></figure> <p>
              Meanwhile my extension’s user base was dwindling, and I could do
              absolutely nothing about it.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/ee3fd6a.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>

                July.
              </figcaption></figure> <p>
              After another two weeks I finally gave up and sent this final
              email. I got a reply that my case was “Reopened”. It’s been a
              month and I didn’t hear back since, so I don’t think I will ever
              get my extension back on the store.
            </p> <figure><img src="https://by.graffino.com/_nuxt/img/3e2eaf4.png" alt="Google's first email response to Graffino's complaint."> <figcaption>Final email from my side.</figcaption></figure> <p>
              I’m not playing the victim here, and I don’t expect this post to
              solve anything for my extension. I just want you to think twice
              before creating a revenue stream based on the Chrome Web Store.
            </p> <p>
              Google has great automated tools and services, to help
              developers ramp up and deliver their apps to users quickly and
              painless. Most of the time these tools work perfectly. The
              problems arise when they don’t.
            </p> <p>
              I have never experienced such frustration, and such feelings of
              helplessness from any other major player out there. A similar
              issue with the
              <a href="https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.graffino.cleaner-for-facebook-86755BRK69" target="_blank">“Cleaner Facebook” Safari extension”</a>, got promptly solved by Apple in under three days.
            </p> <p>
              Google has a record of very bad user support. Basically, if your
              issue is not listed in the “Support Forums” you’re screwed. If I
              would have based my business on the Chrome Web store, I would be
              out of business by now.
            </p>  <h2>Update 8.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I never imagined this would generate this amount of attention:
              featured by
              <strong>Medium, 100k+</strong> views, heated discussions on
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/51mgix/how_google_obliterated_my_4_year_old_chrome/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
              or
              <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12442048" target="_blank">Hackernews</a>. I don’t really expect this to change anything for me, but I’m
              glad people are speaking up. If Google would implement a paid
              support option like Apple does for its developers, I’m sure a
              lot of pain would be avoided.
            </p> <p>
              I try to read everything, but I don’t respond on Medium (hate
              the commenting system), but you can ping me on Twitter.
            </p> <h2>To answer the most common questions:</h2> <p>1.<em> “Why don’t you change the name completely?”</em></p> <p>
              Well, because using “for Facebook” in the name is considered
              <a href="http://www.inta.org/TrademarkBasics/FactSheets/Pages/FairUse.aspx" target="_blank">fair use</a>. Also, when managing an app or extension with that many users,
              you don’t really want to confuse the users by renaming it to a
              completely different thing over night. It’s also an extension
              that only works on Facebook. I might also be infringing with the
              icon.
            </p> <p>
              So, you see, I really need guidelines to do this. Again, my
              problem is with the way this was handled, not the takedown

              2.

              This is simply untrue. I don't believe I was intentionally
              targeted. I was simply unlucky enough to be targeted by
              automated tools. Even the way my requests were handled weren’t
              done with malicious intent by Google. I think I’m just an edge
              case for which their support tools aren’t equipped to deal with.
            </p> <h2>Update: 9.09.2016</h2> <p>
              I received an email from Google today in which they’re
              expressing their apologies about the incident. It seems that
              they cannot do anything for the current store entry until the
              original complainant retracts his complain.

              They offered me clear options though. We’re currently assessing
              what the best option might be. As I said in the article, this
              wasn’t an intentional targeting but a slip-up of their support
              which they’re trying to fix.
            </p> <p>
              Hopefully I will have the time to write a follow-up once all
              this is over. I didn’t expect or wanted this kind of attention,
              these have been 2 stressful days for me, trying to keep up with
              all the requests and messages, as I do have a job and my own
              company to run.

              It also happens that today is my birthday. I guess receiving a
              response from Google was my birthday present :).

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, one of the key discoveries is that it is not always possible that we could measure two physical observables precisely, which is the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>



<p>We might have learned a special case of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle from high school or college physics courses that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be predicted from initial conditions, and vice versa. In this case, the two physical observables are position and momentum.</p>



<p>Formally, the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle states that the product of the variances of two arbitrary hermitian operators on a given state is always greater than or equal to one-fourth the square of the expected value of their commutator. In formulas:</p><p>

\[\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) \geq \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^2\]

</p><p>where $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1)$ and $\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2)$ are using the notations from my previous <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">post</a>, $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2]$ is called the commutator of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$, and $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = \Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \Omega_2 \Omega_1$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show a mathematical proof to Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>We would use the following four theorems and properties to prove Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle.</p>

<h4 id="cauchyschwarz-inequality">Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality</h4>

<p>The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $u$ and $v$ of an inner product space it is true that</p><p>

\[\langle u, u \rangle \langle v, v \rangle \geq | \langle u, v \rangle | ^ 2\]

</p><p>The proof could be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<h4 id="imaginary-part-of-vector-inner-product">Imaginary Part of Vector Inner Product</h4>

<p>The imaginary part of the inner product of all vectors $u$ and $v$, $\text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big)$, could be computed as</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>Assuming $u = a_1 + b_1 i$ and $v = a_2 + b_2 i$, where $a_1$, $a_2$, $b_1$, and $b_2$ are real (column) vectors.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle u, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= (a_2 + b_2 i)^{\dagger} (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} - b_2^{\top} i) (a_1 + b_1 i) \\
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) + \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\langle v, u \rangle &amp;= u^{\dagger} v \\
&amp;= (a_1 + b_1 i)^{\dagger} (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} - b_1^{\top} i) (a_2 + b_2 i) \\
&amp;= (a_1^{\top} a_2 + b_1^{\top} b_2) + (a_1^{\top} b_2 - b_1^{\top} a_2) i \\ 
&amp;= (a_2^{\top} a_1 + b_2^{\top} b_1) + (a_2^{\top} b_1 - b_2^{\top} a_1) i \\ 
&amp;= \text{Re}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) - \text{Im}\big(\langle u, v \rangle\big) i\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>It is trivial to see that</p><p>

\[\text{Im}\big( \langle u, v \rangle \big) = \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle u, v \rangle - \langle v, u \rangle \big)\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="triangle-inequality">Triangle Inequality</h4>

<p>Let $z$ be any complex number, we have</p><p>

\[| z | ^2 \geq | \text{Im}(z) | ^2\]

</p><p>This should be very straightforward to the people who are familiar with triangles and know the polar coordinate expression of complex numbers. We will skip the formal proof here.</p>

<h4 id="hermitian-property">Hermitian Property</h4>

<p>If A is a hermitian $n$-by-$n$ matrix, then for all $u, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}$. we have</p><p>

\[\langle Au, v \rangle = \langle u, Av \rangle\]

</p><p>Using the property of hermitian matrix $A^{\dagger} = A$, we simply have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Au, v \rangle &amp;= v^{\dagger} Au \\
&amp;= v^{\dagger} A^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= {(Av)}^{\dagger} u \\
&amp;= \langle u, Av \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="proof-to-heisenbergs-general-uncertainty-principle">Proof to Heisenberg’s General Uncertainty Principle</h3>

<p>Because $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega) = \Omega - \langle \Omega \rangle_{\psi} I$ and $\Omega$ is a hermitian operator, therefore $\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)$ is also a hermitian operator. Based on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-Mean-Variance/">the definition of variance</a>, using the hermitian property, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \rangle_{\psi} \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega)) \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We apply the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the left side of the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;= \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) \psi \rangle \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) \psi \rangle \\
&amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further apply the Triangle inequality,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq | \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle | ^ 2 \\
&amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the imaginary part of vector inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \big| \text{Im}\big( \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle \big) \big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We use the hermitian property again,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_1) \mathbb{V}_{\psi}(\Omega_2) &amp;\geq \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1))\psi, \psi \rangle - \langle (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2))\psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) - (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_1)) (\Delta_{\psi}(\Omega_2)) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) - (\Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} I) (\Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} I) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle ( (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) - (\Omega_1 \Omega_2 - \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_1 - \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \Omega_2 + \langle \Omega_1 \rangle_{\psi} \langle \Omega_2 \rangle_{\psi} ) ) \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  (\Omega_2 \Omega_1 - \Omega_1 \Omega_2)  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| \frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle  - [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \big(\langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2]  \psi, \psi \rangle \big) \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \Big| -\frac{1}{2i} \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} \Big| ^ 2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{4} | \langle [\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \rangle_{\psi} | ^ 2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$ suggests $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 = \Omega_2 \Omega_1$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2 | \psi \rangle = \Omega_2 \Omega_1 | \psi \rangle$. This means that the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are the same if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$. Otherwise, if $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] \neq 0$ the system states after the two sequential measures $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ and $\Omega_1 \Omega_2$ are not the same. If the commutator $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$, Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle suggests that the two physical observables that $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are measuring would have not limit in precision.</p>



<p>In other expressions of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle, sometimes we would see the word “simultaneity”. How to understand the simultaneity in Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Given measurement would change the system state, and it is almost impossible to achieve the absolute simultaneity in the time domain, what does the simultaneity mean in this case? Here simultaneity means that the order of measurement $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ do not change the final observation, as we tried hard to make them simultaneous and it is impossible to control the exact order of these two measurements. In short, simultaneity just means $[\Omega_1, \Omega_2] = 0$.</p>



<p>How to measure the variance of physical observable for a system state, as is shown at the left side of the inequality of Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle? Measurement changes system state in quantum mechanics. We would need to create lots of clones of the system state. Once a system state is measured, it should be discarded and not be used for the measurement for the physical observable anymore. Measurement on the same system state means measurement on system state clones and not the exact system state.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>It is quite amazing that the Heisenberg’s general uncertainty principle could be derived in a such simple way. Unfortunately, the my college physics course instructor never showed a proof to this important principle.</p>

<h2 id="org5aed8cc">Introduction</h2>
<div id="text-org5aed8cc">
<p>
I was asked in an interview once to reconstruct a tree given the pre-order
and in-order traversals.  I bombed it.  I could talk through a general
idea.  Which I'll do with some illustrations, but I terribly bombed as I
did not get an answer.
</p>

<p>
So, lets do a brief descussion on it.  First, a tree.
</p>


<p><img src="https://taeric.github.io/a-tree.png" alt="a-tree.png">
</p>

<p>
For this illustration, I'm showing both child links of any node that has
any children, with one of them going to Λ if it is a null link.  As a quick
refresher on the standard orders you can list the nodes of a tree, this
tree would be "ABCJKEGH" in pre-order, and "JCKBAEHG" in in-order.  (And if
you did post-order, you would get "JKCBHGEA".)
</p>

<p>
The question, then, is given two of these orders, would you have enough
information to recreate the tree?
</p>

<p>
The answer is yes, if the two orders you have ar pre-order and in-order.
Also if you have in-order and post-order, but <b>not</b> if you have pre-order
and post-order; unless you know the tree is "full," in which case you can
use those two orders.  For this page, I'm only going to be looking at the
first case.
</p>

<p>
The reason it is doable from the pre-order/in-order combo is that you know
the root of the tree from the pre-order, and if you split the in-order with
that value, you know the nodes that make up the left and right.  From which
you can find the pre-order of them and do this again.
</p>

<p>
This makes an algorithm straight forward.  In lisp, taking liberties and
using lists for the orders, this is as simple as this:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>defstruct</span> <span>node</span> value left right)

(<span>defun</span> <span>make-tree-from-traversals</span> (pre-order in-order)
  (<span>when</span> pre-order
    (<span>let*</span> ((root-value         (first pre-order))
           (left-in-order      (list-before in-order root-value))
           (right-in-order     (list-after in-order root-value))
           (left-pre-order     (list-filter-to-same-elmts pre-order left-in-order))
           (right-pre-order    (list-filter-to-same-elmts pre-order right-in-order)))
      (make-node <span>:value</span> root-value
                 <span>:left</span> (make-tree-from-traversals left-pre-order left-in-order)

(<span>defun</span> <span>list-after</span> (lst i)
  (<span>cond</span> ((eq i (first lst))   (rest lst))
        ((eq lst nil)         nil)
        (t                    (list-after (rest lst) i))))

(<span>defun</span> <span>list-before</span> (lst i)
  (<span>cond</span> ((eq i (first lst))     nil)
        ((eq lst nil)           nil)
        (t                      (cons (first lst) (list-before (rest lst) i)))))

(<span>defun</span> <span>list-filter-to-same-elmts</span> (lst elmts)
  (<span>loop</span> for v in lst
        if (find v elmts)
          collect v))

(make-tree-from-traversals '(a b c j k e g h) '(j c k b a e h g))
</pre>
</div>

<pre>#S(NODE
   :VALUE A
   :LEFT #S(NODE
            :VALUE B
            :LEFT #S(NODE
                     :VALUE C
                     :LEFT #S(NODE :VALUE J :LEFT NIL :RIGHT NIL)
                     :RIGHT #S(NODE :VALUE K :LEFT NIL :RIGHT NIL))
            :RIGHT NIL)
   :RIGHT #S(NODE
             :VALUE E
             :LEFT NIL
             :RIGHT #S(NODE
                       :VALUE G
                       :LEFT #S(NODE :VALUE H :LEFT NIL :RIGHT NIL)
                       :RIGHT NIL)))
</pre>

<p>
Note that the pretty print of the data is enough to show the structure,
where you can see that "e" has a nil left and "g" has a right nil, for
example.
</p>

<p>
To further that this is correct, you can also just print the pre-order and
in-order to see if they give the same values.  We can do that here:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>defun</span> <span>pre-order</span> (root)
  (<span>when</span> root
    (format t <span>"~a"</span> (node-value root))
    (pre-order (node-left root))
    (pre-order (node-right root))))

(<span>defun</span> <span>in-order</span> (root)
  (<span>when</span> root
    (in-order (node-left root))
    (format t <span>"~a"</span> (node-value root))
    (in-order (node-right root))))

(format t <span>"Pre-order: "</span>)
(pre-order #S(NODE
              <span>:VALUE</span> A
              <span>:LEFT</span> #S(NODE
                       <span>:VALUE</span> B
                       <span>:LEFT</span> #S(NODE
                                <span>:VALUE</span> C

<h2 id="org8be69a4">What was amusing about that?</h2>
<div id="text-org8be69a4">
<p>
But I said I bombed this?  I also titled the post as searching for an
amusing algorithm, so?
</p>

<p>
I bombed this because I had remembered reading this exact problem in
Knuth's Art of Computer Programming Vol 1.  I told the person interviewing
me, but they weren't aware of any clever algorithm.  (That or they just
wanted me to get the straight forward way done first.  A reasonable
desire.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless, I couldn't shake what I half remembered from that book.  And,
being an interview, I also could not consult the book.  So, I kept battling
what I thought I remembered as a straight forward iterative solution that
made clever use of "thread" links.  (If you don't know what a "threaded
tree is, I highly recommend looking those up.)
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, I made the mistake of not working out the problem on
my first read through.  I sketched it in my mind and thought I saw a way to
make it happen.  But I did not follow through with that.
</p>

<p>
Flash forward several years, and I finally had a good reason to remember
and devote time to this.  In a book club at work, we are reading this
section and I recalled bombing that interview.  So, I was hoping someone in
the group would know the trick I did not.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, nope.  And consulting the book showed that I basically remembered
all of the hint.  Only reference to the algoritm is to link the nodes using
the left link to go to the next by pre-order, and the right nodes to go to
the next by in-order. From there, it is ostensibly "quite amusing to
construct a simple algorithm…"
</p>

<p>
To get an idea of what that would look like for this tree, here it is drawn
with the left links in solid, and the right links dashed.
</p>


<p><img src="https://taeric.github.io/pre-order-to-left-in-order-to-right.png" alt="pre-order-to-left-in-order-to-right.png">
</p>


<p>
As of right now, I don't know what the "amusingly simple" algorithm is.
However, I have pieced together something.  In the spirit of Polya's "use
all of the provided data", I thought I would run with a reference in the
text that said "In some algorithms it can be guaranteed that the root of
any subtree always will appear in a lower memory location than the other
nodes of the subtree."
</p>

<p>
In particular, this trick, I thought, would be all that I needed so that I
could recognize "thread" links in the tree from normal ones.  If this is
the trick, it is certainly not all of it, as I did not see any easy way to
work with the threads.
</p>

<p>
Further, to work with an algorithm that I have control of things being
lower in memory than others would be a bit of a challenge.  Luckily, no
reason to use literal memory locations.  I could just build an array and
use indexes into the array instead of references to memory.
</p>

<p>
With that, I came up with this beast:
</p>

<div>
<pre>(<span>defun</span> <span>create-from-traversals-iterative</span> (pre-order in-order)

          do (setf (elt nodes i) (make-node <span>:value</span> v

                                            <span>:right</span> (index-of-preorder-for-next-in-order v
                                                                                        pre-order

    <span>;;</span><span>The left of the last item will be set one high, quick correction here.</span>
    (setf (node-left (elt nodes (1- n))) -1)

    <span>;;</span><span>Now, convert all of the index links into standard links, per inspection</span>
    (<span>loop</span> for node across nodes

          do (<span>let</span> ((cur node)
                   (highest i)

               <span>;;</span><span>Find the "highest" node that we can find walking right.</span>

                               cur (elt nodes (node-right cur))))


               (<span>cond</span>

                 ((&gt; i seen) <span>;; </span><span>If the root is the highest we saw, there is nothing right of this</span>
                             <span>;; </span><span>node</span>
                  (setf (node-right node) nil))

                 ((&lt; i seen) <span>;; </span><span>Otherwise, move the highest we saw to be right of here, removing it</span>
                             <span>;; </span><span>from the left of where it is in the array.</span>
                  (setf (node-left (elt nodes (- seen 1)))  -1
                        (node-right node)                   (elt nodes seen))))

               (<span>cond</span>
                 ((&lt; i (node-left node)) <span>;; </span><span>If left is still an index, convert that to the relevant</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1316098702260359168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p> </div></div>]]>

<h2><span id="Difficulties">Difficulties</span></h2>
<p>While discussing the declaration with parents, teachers and children, I realized that many are not even free to speak. One of the authors of the declaration, a teacher, requested anonymity. It might hurt his reputation at school. One of the moms flatly refused a permission to let her kid join the support. Even more, she kindly requested I do not discuss my ideas with her son any more. He is in trouble at school "well enough". For kids to tolerate the oppression, there must be unanimity in the adult world. If I question the limits on freedom, the kid will cling to the only ally he can find. I experienced that many times. This universal dislike of schooling was one of the reason for this initiative. It is not a healthy situation in society when <b>we are not even free to talk freely about freedom</b>!

<p>How we ensure that scraped records stay functional.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/self-healing.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/self-healing.jpg 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/self-healing.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>When you scrape a website, it's inevitable that the data you selected will change. The data itsself will change but also the structure behind it. Or as we call it, the DOM. </p><h3 id="but-why-does-it-change">But why does it change?</h3><p>Changes to websites are inevitable. Just like we update Scraper.AI regulary, the engineering team of that website will also update their website. Those adjustments are needed to introduce new features, fix bugs, ... .</p><p>Changes that website engineers often make can be categorized as:</p><ul><li><strong>Structural</strong>: The Structure of the document changes, containers were moved, text was added, ...</li><li><strong>Styling</strong>: The appearance of elements was changed (ex. a new color was given to the text)</li><li><strong>Interactive</strong>: The way you interact with something has changed, for example, clicking the button now opens a popup instead of shifting the page.</li></ul><p>However, those <u>structural</u> changes might bring tiny alterations that will prevent your previously working scrape from working again. Requiring you to manually update everything, all over again.</p><h3 id="this-is-where-self-healing-comes-in">This is where self-healing comes in</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-3.png 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/10/image-3.png 765w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>When paths don't work, self-healing will identify this and try to fix it. It might do this by finding the exact piece of text you asked for. Or it will try to look closer if your selection can't be found in a certain proximity.</p><h3 id="in-technical-terms">In technical terms</h3><p>Technically it might look like this. Let's assume that we selected some text in a container and obtain the following XPath:</p><figure><pre><code>/html/body/div[8]/div[3]/div/div[3]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul/li/div/section/div/div/div[2]</code></pre><figcaption>The previously working XPath</figcaption></figure><p>However, the site pushes an update and changes its structure, which breaks that XPath on the next scrape. Our systems will now detect this and try to self-heal it.</p><p>The "healed" path looks now like</p><figure><pre><code>/html/body/div[7]/div[3]/div/div[3]/div/div/div/ul/li[1]/div/section/div/div/div[2]/div[1]</code></pre><figcaption>The adjusted path</figcaption></figure><p>You can notice that if we try to analyze this, quite a lot has changed, let's highlight it in bold:</p><p>/html/body/div<strong>[7]</strong>/div[3]/div/div[3]/<strong>div/div</strong>/<strong>div</strong>/ul/<strong>li[1]</strong>/div/section/div/div/<strong>div[2]/div[1]</strong></p><p>These are subtle changes, but make a world of difference, or in our terms, the difference between working and not working.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Self-healing was introduced to boost reliability. It's an important feature that will prevent you from having to make updates to previously selected paths. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>ðŸ¥³</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve been working at warp speed since our <code>v0.7.0</code> release in June, adding over <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/compare/v0.7.0...main">870 commits</a> since then. :sweat:</p>
<p>Here are some of the bigger changes:</p>
<h3>LemmyNet projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet">LemmyNet</a>, where all lemmy-related projects live.</li>
<li>Split out the frontend into a separete repository, <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a></li>
<li>Created a <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-js-client">lemmy-js-client</a>, for any js / typescript developers.</li>
<li>Split out i18n <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-translations">lemmy-translations</a>, that any app or site developers can import and use. Lemmy currently supports <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/lemmy/">~30 languages!</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Lemmy Server</h3>
<h4>Federation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first <strong>federation public beta release</strong>, woohoo ðŸŽ†</li>
<li>All Lemmy functionality now works over ActivityPub (except turning remote users into mods/admins)</li>
<li>Instance allowlist and blocklist</li>
<li>Documentation for <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_federation.html">admins</a> and <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/contributing_federation_overview.html">devs</a> on how federation works</li>
<li>Upgraded to newest versions of @asonix activitypub libraries</li>
<li>Full local federation setup for manual testing</li>
<li>Automated testing for nearly every federation action</li>
<li>Many additional security checks</li>
<li>Lots and lots of refactoring</li>
<li>Asynchronous sending of outgoing activities</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Separated the UI from the server code, in <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy-ui">lemmy-ui</a>.</li>
<li>The UI can now read with javascript disabled!</li>
<li>Itâ€™s now a fully isomorphic application using <a href="https://infernojs.org/docs/guides/isomorphic">inferno-isomorphic</a>. This means that page loads are now much faster, as the server does the work.</li>
<li>The UI now also supports open-graph and twitter cards! Linking to lemmy posts (from whatever platform you use) looks pretty now: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6TZ2v7s.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Improved the search page ( more features incoming ).</li>
<li>The default view is now <code>Local</code>, instead of <code>All</code>, since all would show all federated posts.</li>
<li>User settings are now shared across browsers ( a page refresh will pick up changes ).</li>
<li>A much leaner mobile view.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Backend</h4>
<ul>
<li>Re-organized the rust codebase into separate workspaces for backend and frontend.</li>
<li>Removed materialized views, making the database <strong>a lot faster</strong>.</li>
<li>New post sorts <code>Active</code> (previously called hot), and <code>Hot</code>. Active shows posts with recent comments, hot shows highly ranked posts.</li>
<li>New sort for <code>Local</code> ( meaning from local communities).</li>
<li>Customizeable site, user, and community icons and banners.</li>
<li>Added user preferred names / display names, bios, and cakedays.</li>
<li>Visual / Audio captchas through the lemmy API.</li>
<li>Lots of API field verifications.</li>
<li>Upgraded to pictrs-v2 ( thanks to @asonix )</li>
<li>Wayyy too many bugfixes to count.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contributors</h2>
<p>Weâ€™d also like to thank both the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet foundation</a> for their support in allowing us to work full-time on Lemmy ( as well as their support for <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/current.html">other important open-source projects</a> ), <a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/sponsors">those who sponsor us</a>, and those who <a href="https://weblate.yerbamate.dev/projects/lemmy/">help translate Lemmy</a>. Every little bit does help. We remain committed to never allowing advertisements, monetizing, or venture-capital in Lemmy; software should be communal, and should benefit humanity, not a small group of company owners.</p>
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_docker.html#updating">with manual Docker installation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.lemmy.ml/docs/administration_install_ansible.html">with Ansible installation</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing Federation</h2>
<p>Federation is finally ready in Lemmy, pending possible bugs or other issues. So for now we suggest to enable federation only on test servers, or try it on our own test servers ( <a href="https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/">enterprise</a>, <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">ds9</a>, <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/">voyager</a> ).</p>
<p>If everything goes well, after a few weeks we will enable federation on <a href="http://dev.lemmy.ml/">dev.lemmy.ml</a>, at first with a limited number of trusted instances. We will also likely change the domain to <a href="https://lemmy.ml/">https://lemmy.ml</a> . Keep in mind that changing domains after turning on federation will break things.</p>
<p>To enable on your instance, edit your <a href="https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/blob/main/config/defaults.hjson#L60">lemmy.hjson</a> federation section to <code>enabled: true</code>, and restart.</p>
<h3>Connecting to another server</h3>
<p>The server <a href="https://ds9.lemmy.ml/">https://ds9.lemmy.ml</a> has open federation, so after either adding it to the <code>allowed_instances</code> list in your <code>config.hjson</code>, or if you have open federation, you donâ€™t need to add it explicitly.</p>
<p>To federate / connect with a server, type in <code>!community_name@server.tld</code>, in your serverâ€™s search box <a href="https://voyager.lemmy.ml/search/q/!main%40ds9.lemmy.ml/type/All/sort/TopAll/page/1">like so</a>.</p>
<p>To connect with the <code>main</code> community on ds9, the search is <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code>.</p>
<p>You can then click the community, and you will see a local version of the community, which you can subscribe to. New posts and comments from <code>!main@ds9.lemmy.ml</code> will now show up on your front page, or <code>/c/All</code></p>

Here's a summary. There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_heater_unit" target="_blank">radioisotope heater units</a> (RHUs) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a> (RTGs) in space. Examples include the RHU used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang%27e_4" target="_blank">Chang'e 4</a> to survive cold lunar nights, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHW-RTG" target="_blank">MHW-RTG</a>s in the Voyager probes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPHS-RTG" target="_blank">GPHS-RTG</a>s used by Cassini and New Horizons, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission_radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">MMRTG</a>s at the heart of Curiosity, Perseverance, and the in-development Dragonfly. (Interestingly, an RTG using <sup>241</sup>Am has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator#RTG_for_interstellar_probes" target="_blank">proposed for an interstellar mission</a> (<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>), as its 432-year half-life could provide 500+ years of power [<a href="http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/misc/trieste_may02_mtg/McNutt_Ralph.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>].) The world’s first nuclear fission reactor, and the only launched by the US, was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNAP-10A" target="_blank">SNAP 10-A</a>, a <sup>235</sup>Uranium-Zirconium hydride reactor with sodium-potassium (NaK) coolant which had a thermal power output of 30 kW. It was launched in 1965, stopped working after just 43 days, and has had <em>seven</em> “anomalous events” that caused nearly 50 trackable pieces of debris to be shed from the craft. It should stay in orbit for 3,000 years… unless it breaks up further. The other ~30 known fission reactors were launched in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-A" target="_blank">Soviet RORSATs</a>: nuclear-powered LEO ocean-surveillance radar satellites that required periodic boosts to prevent reentry. They were designed to launch their <sup>235</sup>U reactors to a higher orbit at the end of their operational lives. (These orbits will last 300-1,000 years, but the reactor fuel has a half-life of 70,000 years… so future generations may not love the plan.) But, these boosts didn’t always happen: in 1978, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_954" target="_blank">Cosmos 954 RORSAT</a> malfunctioned, reentered, and broke apart over northern Canada with the reactor attached, scattering radioactive debris over an 800 km long path—the USSR eventually paid $3M for cleanup, about a fifth of the true cost. Other satellites have also broken up in orbit, spreading radioactive debris, like the US’s Transit 5BN3 (carrying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_for_Nuclear_Auxiliary_Power#SNAP-9" target="_blank">SNAP RTG</a>) and the USSR’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1402" target="_blank">Cosmos 1402 RORSAT</a>. Others, including the higher power and higher orbit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1818" target="_blank">Kosmos 1818</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1867" target="_blank">Kosmos 1867</a> RORSATs, have leaked trails of radioactive NaK coolant. The usefulness of the Gamma Ray Spectrometer on NASA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Maximum_Mission" target="_blank">SolarMax</a> mission was reduced by <a href="http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/trackind/RORSAT/RORSAT.html#Kosmos-1867" target="_blank">anomalous gamma ray emissions from these leaking higher-orbit reactors</a>.

                <div>
                    <p>Bottoms-up growth is a buzzy go-to-market technique right now. From the exciting self-service adoption of products like Figma to the record breaking growth of Zoom, products that enable individuals to adopt a tool without first having to talk to sales is a winning strategy. Customers get started faster, and because they understand the product, they don’t need to be marketed or sold to in order to make a purchase decision.</p><p>But these companies are finding that self-service adoption is only the first step in a customer journey. For the business to grow, individuals and teams adoption needs to eventually lead to enterprise sales. Sure, in the best case that happens naturally as excitement inside the company forces a CIO’s decision. More often than not though, it still requires traditional sales to step in. </p><p>The tricky part is that all that self-service usage data is messy. There’s nothing stopping people from signing up with personal emails or multiple people at the same company from signing up for their own teams, completely independently from each other. All of this easy adoption leaves you with multiple different teams and overlapping users, all working for the same employer. Cutting through the noise for Sales, Marketing, and Success teams requires bringing order to the chaos. </p><p>Today, we’ll talk through how you can structure product data into account hierarchies that are actionable, all within SQL and your Data Warehouse. Here's what we'll cover:</p><ul><li>How to identify companies</li><li>Understanding your current product data model</li><li>Aggregating product data into companies</li><li>Using your new hierarchy</li></ul><h2 id="identifying-companies">Identifying companies</h2><div><p>It all starts by figuring out what real world companies are using your product. And in order to identify a unique, real world company, we need a reliable identifier. Unfortunately, that may not be immediately obvious if you’re just looking at a list of users that have signed up to start using your product. But we have one very obvious hint: domain names that appear in users email addresses. </p><p>Domain names are the easiest place to start building an account hierarchy. They’re easy for humans to understand and debug. And users are often providing them directly to you as part of their email address. Alternatively, you can also ask users to provide this domain as they’re signing up to your product. </p><p>To start building our account hierarchy of companies, we’ll create a set of all the domain names that appear in our database. There’s some obvious issues to this (A very common example gmail.com users) and we’ll address them along the way. So let’s see what domains we have.</p></div><h2 id="understanding-your-data-model">Understanding your data model</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png" alt="Understanding your data model" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Understanding-your-data-model.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We’re going to be translating one model to the other so before we dive in, let's get a handle on what your data looks like currently and where it’s located. It may be spread across a few different tables, it may not even be in your data warehouse (<a href="https://blog.getcensus.com/graduating-to-the-modern-data-stack-for-startups/">you do have a data warehouse, right?</a>). </p><p>One thing to keep an eye out for: does your product have a workspace concept? You might call it an organization, a group, or a team. This group is a really powerful hint we can use for identifying companies. If you do have workspaces, you’ll also need to know who is the “owner” of a workspace. This is typically the user that created it, but you may have a better identifier such as admin.</p><p>With your users and your workspaces, you can use some basic SQL to extract the domain from an email address. For each user and workspace, you now know which Company they belong to. We can use this to start aggregating our users.</p><p>Pro tip: You may have situations where companies are represented by more than one domain. In this case, you’ll want to add the ability to associate secondary domains to a primary domain as part of rolling up workspaces together.</p><h2 id="aggregating-into-companies">Aggregating into Companies</h2><p>The simplest hierarchy is </p><ul><li>GROUP BY domain</li><li>COUNT(*) of users or workspaces</li></ul><p>We’ve got the start of our account hierarchy. We can roll up more metrics from here. For each metric, it’s a matter of thinking about what sort of aggregation makes sense at the company level, ie SUM, AVG, MAX</p><p>What about personal email domain users like gmail.com or outlook.com? Well, that depends a bit on your business. You have three options, and the right option for you depends on what percentage of your user base use personal accounts</p><p><strong>1) Ignore them</strong><br>This is a completely reasonable option and the best place to start. Chances are, users that provided a personal email address are likely using your product for personal reasons. For example, someone using Notion to track their sourdough recipes are not going to be interested in Enterprise Single Sign-on features. So, you may want to just ignore them. You can do that by simply ignoring every domain in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/tbrianjones/5992856/">comprehensive list of public email domains</a>.</p><p><strong>2) Roll up to a single account</strong><br>You could also translate all of the personal usage into a separate Public Email catch all company/account. This is a great strategy if you plan to connect these users/leads to other parts of your marketing automation and don’t need company information. If you’re planning on publishing this data to a CRM however, it’s really only worth while if you plan on having a human review the users that end up associated with this account.</p><p><strong>3) Use firmographic data </strong><br>The most advanced option is incorporate firmographic data such as data provided by Clearbit, Zoominfo, or FullContact to translate a personal email address into an employer. Note that this data is not perfectly accurate so you may end up linking users to their previous employers or to someone completely unrelated to them. </p><h2 id="using-your-new-hierarchy">Using your new hierarchy</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png" alt="Using your new data hierarchy diagram" srcset="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1000w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 1600w, https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/10/Using-your-new-hierarchy--1-.png 2080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now that you’ve got your Account Hierarchy up and running, you can start putting it to use. Census makes it easy to connect the data models you build in your Data Warehouse to the Sales and Marketing products you use to drive your Customer Journey, but how that journey unfolds is completely up to you.</p><p>What you’ve built is a Business Identity model that you can share across all of your products and tools. Census helps you associate this product model with all the other tools you use to serve your customer.</p><p>Here’s just a few ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Enrich your existing accounts and contacts with usage data</strong> - Use this data to give account reps context on what users are doing in product without searching across all your tools</li><li><strong>Identify net new logos</strong> - Use the data to identify companies that are actively using the product but are not yet in your CRM.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>October 08, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><p>Any successful founder will tell you that team, product, and market are the most critical factors to building a successful business. And you’ll probably hear many of them talk about being “customer-obsessed” or “customer first.” But one of the most underrated factors in their success is not just the customers but also the quality of their early adopters.</p>
<p>While we can all agree that early adopters are good, they are not all created equal. The wrong users can derail entrepreneurs, causing them to lose focus and solve the wrong problems. Like a bad team or poor product, the wrong early adopters can push a company towards failure.</p>
<p>You should be picky about who you serve, especially during the initial phase of your product development process. Finding early adopters should be an investment similar to hiring a team. Entrepreneurs should recruit, interview, qualify, and partner with early adopters that will help them become most successful. It’s not a simple process and shouldn’t be taken for granted.</p>
<p>So how do you find the right early adopters? That’s a difficult question to answer. It’s all going to come down to your market, product, and judgment. But here are some characteristics that you should look for.</p>
<h2>They are in real pain.</h2>
<p>The right early users are deeply affected by the problem that you’re solving. They know the problem exists and are hungry for a better solution. They’ve probably tried other solutions and yearn for something better.</p>
<p>Early adopters will be keenly aware of the problem. They will explain the problem in various ways and how it affects their ability to work, live, or perform some activity. They’ve probably even tried to solve it somehow, maybe using Excel, some no-code app, a third-party tool, or a manual process.</p>
<h2>Their problem is very specific.</h2>
<p>Users have all kinds of problems. Most of which you’ll never solve. Others might be in your roadmap but are not core today. It’s essential to focus on users with the specific problem that you are solving for. Problems can emerge from various systems, workflows, and integrations that have nothing to do with the core problem or your potential solution. Eliminate the users who are looking to solve all of their problems. Eliminate the users who want a different, possibly related, problem solved.</p>
<p>The best early adopters need to solve a specific problem. It’s vital to ensure that it matches your vision and product solution.</p>
<h2>They are excited to help you.</h2>
<p>The solution you’re offering them is going to alleviate a pain point, and the best early adopters are more than excited to help you help them. The more excited they are, the more pain they experience from the problem.</p>
<p>Early adopters are partners. They should be excited about working with you, helping you solve their problem, and providing feedback. They should also be excited that they will be using your solution before others and developing a competitive edge as well.</p>
<p>When you acquire great early adopters, they will be the ones sending you feedback often and with excitement. They’ll be proud to help you craft your solution and feel like their part of the team.</p>
<h2>They are empowered</h2>
<p>Early adopters must be empowered to make decisions quickly. Working with your dream enterprise customer sounds great, but if they can’t get approval, move quickly, or activate your solution, you’ll be at the mercy of their bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Working with early adopters is a partnership, not a transaction. It’s important that early adopters can take your prototype, beta, or product and implement it within their team or organization.</p>
<p>The person is as vital as the company. Are they authorized to make the right decisions? Can they dedicate the time and resources to the problem and solution? Are they empowered to help you create the right solution? If they can’t meet these criteria, you should find another early adopter who can.</p>
<h2>They have a high-risk tolerance.</h2>
<p>The best products are built with customers, through an iterative process of trial and error. Early adopters who experience the pain are not enough; you need a partner who can tolerate the risks involved in the product development process. Not only do they have a high-risk tolerance, but they should also be willing and able to engage in ongoing experiments throughout the process.</p>
<p>Experimentation is critical to the process. You need to ensure that you partner with a customer that recognizes the process is about learning and improvement, not a finished product.</p>
<p>When interviewing customers, you should be upfront about this process and ensure they are comfortable with it. It’s okay if a potential customer can’t commit to the process, you can keep in touch and invite them to the product when it’s a bit more developed.</p>
<h2>Hire early adopters, don’t settle.</h2>
<p>Don’t just settle for the first few customers that show interest in your product. Spend time doing market mapping to better understand the market, sectors, and potential customers. Learn more about the companies and find who the best possible contacts would be. Reach out and conduct interviews to learn more about their organization, how the problem affects them, and their goals regarding the problem and solution. Make sure to dig in and ask tough questions to assess their risk-tolerance, current solutions, and whether they are authorized to make the necessary decisions.</p>
<p>If a potential customer seems like the problem isn’t that big of a deal, you should move on. If they can’t focus on just the one problem, move on. If they aren’t authorized to make decisions, ask about their manager and see if you can work your way up.</p>
<p>You should spend a good amount of time learning about each of these customers and selecting the best candidates. Don’t hesitate to reach out multiple times and have conversations with them to build confidence in your decisions. These will be partners as you experiment and craft your solution, so ensure you find the best possible partners.</p>
<h2>They’re all leads, too.</h2>
<p>Choosing the best early adopters doesn’t mean that the others will not be good future customers. All of these customers are now leads. Some might be great customers once you hit a particular milestone and finish more features; others might be customers down the road. Keep in touch and share updates on the product and feature set.</p>
<p>Recruiting high-quality early adopters is difficult but vital to the success of a company. Spend the time upfront to say no to customers that don’t fit your current vision and mission. While the process is difficult and costly, it’ll be worth the investment as the product matures.</p></section></article></div>]]>

            <p>Facebook’s Reality Labs have <a href="https://tech.fb.com/making-technology-feel-natural/">announced today</a> that their researchers are developing a hand tracking software that would allow touch typists to write in VR without the use of a physical keyboard.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is a predictive motion model for marker-based hand tracking that could allow typists to match their physical typing speed by only tapping their fingers on a flat surface.</p><p>In the blog post announcing the new technology, researchers; Shangchen Han, Mark Richardson, and Robert Wang write,</p><p><em>“To support touch typing without a physical keyboard — and without the benefit of haptic feedback from individual keys — the team had to make sense of erratic typing patterns. They adopted statistical decoding techniques from automatic speech recognition, and where speech recognition uses an acoustic model to predict phonemes from audio frames, they instead use a motion model to predict keystrokes from hand motion. This, along with a language model, predicts what people intended to type despite ambiguous hand motion. Using this new method, typists averaged 73 words per minute with a 2.4% uncorrected error rate using their hands, a flat surface, and nothing else, achieving similar speed and accuracy to the same typist on a physical keyboard.</em></p><p><em>This surprising result led researchers to investigate why hand tracking was more effective than other physical methods, like tapping on a tablet. The team discovered hand tracking is uniquely good at isolating individual fingers and their trajectories as they reach for keys — information that is missing from capacitive sensing on tablets and smartphones today.”</em></p><p>According to Facebook, the software is only in the research stage, they currently have no plans to place it on any product roadmap. There are already Quest titles that make use of the simpler hand tracking software available; <a href="https://www.aldin.io/waltzofthewizard/">Waltz of the Wizard</a> and <a href="https://www.laganaro.com/#/the-line-vr/">The Line</a>. Despite this promising research it looks like we will have to wait at least until the next generation of Oculus headsets to see this appear as a feature.</p>

More accurately, the “debate” was a strong adverse reaction from Troy after I shared a template I built for Prota Ventures’ portfolio companies. His feedback was, essentially, to never use a template and instead build each model from scratch.</em></p><p><em>He invited me to a 90-minute lecture he gave where he overwhelmingly convinced me and the room that, indeed, founders need to take the time necessary to build their models from scratch. After I asked him where I could find his lecture material online, he suggested we co-author this article series since there weren’t many solid resources available. We sincerely hope you find this series helpful.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Our plan is to break this out into a four-part series and guide you through the components necessary for building your own financial model from scratch:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/9/15/startup-financial-modeling-part-1-what-is-a-financial-model" target="_blank">Part 1: The Why and What of Financial Modeling</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-2-start-with-your-assumptions" target="_blank">Part 2: Assumptions</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/2/startup-financial-modeling-part-3-the-income-statement-and-custom-detail-tabs" target="_blank">Part 3: Income Statement and Custom Detail Tabs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.mathventurepartners.com/blog/2016/10/7/startup-financial-modeling-part-4-the-balance-sheet-cash-flow-and-unit-economics" target="_blank">Part 4: Cash Flow, Balance Sheet and Keeping the Model Updated</a></p></li></ul><p>In short, a financial model is an abstract mathematical representation of how a company works (and more importantly, how it will work going forward). The model has inputs and outputs. The inputs are the assumptions that drive the model, things like what drives your customer acquisition cost, what your churn rates are, how much you pay people, etc. The outputs are a set of projections that show how the company will perform if the assumptions are true. One model can produce multiple sets of projections given different assumptions.</p><p>Based on a set of assumptions, a financial model is used to make smart decisions (e.g. how many sales people to hire and what to pay them). The model includes financial projections that are tied mathematically to the assumptions, which allows operators to “play with the variables” in order to understand how certain decisions might affect the future health of their company.</p><p><strong>Troy has an important story to share on this topic:</strong></p><p>“When fundraising for SurePayroll, we had some very high level financials in the pitch deck. Inevitably, VC’s would ask where the numbers came from. I would tell them that we had a very detailed financial model that drove it, I was setting the bait…</p><p>They would ask to be sent a copy of the model and I would refuse. I would only share it by first sitting down with them and an associate and reviewing the model in person and after that 90 minute session, I would leave them a copy of the model to play with further.</p><blockquote><p>They would insist that they could figure it out without the meeting, but I ALWAYS held my ground. I wanted the meeting not just to save them time and frustration learning a new model, but more importantly to get more face time with them in a situation where I was going to shine.</p></blockquote><p>I knew the model inside and out since I built it; I could answer any question about any cell and look like a genius. In the end, I did eight&nbsp;of these meetings and EVERY ONE of the firms that did the 90 minute meeting with me on the financial model either made an investment in the company or made an offer to invest in the company.&nbsp;<strong>Every single one</strong>.”</p><p>While it’s easy to search around and find a template to use, those templates were built by someone with a particular business in mind. Since every business is unique, this will lead you into trouble.</p><p>While it’s often helpful to&nbsp;<em>learn&nbsp;</em>from other people’s models to ensure, for example, that you aren’t missing anything important, you should never build your model using their template. You’ll end up banging your head against a wall when you need to change things, and you’ll inevitably be confused about some nuance that will come back to haunt you since you don’t understand it.</p><blockquote><p>In other words, while you may think that a template will help you save time, what you are actually doing is acquiring “technical debt” that will end up costing you more time in the long run.</p></blockquote><p>Plus, it’s critical to understand every column, row, cell and tab in your spreadsheet for two key reasons; it will help you better manage your business, and when the time comes to explain it to an investor, you’ll be able to explain exactly how it works and increase your odds of landing funding.</p><p>Since most people are using the financial model to communicate projections to investors, it is critical that you speak the investors’ language. They are used to having financials in Excel, so you should build your model in Excel.</p><blockquote><p>Google sheets is convenient for making changes and having multiple people editing, but sending an investor a model in Google sheets signals that you are not financially savvy.</p></blockquote><p>Investors are also used to seeing three standard statements; an income statement, a balance sheet, and a statement of cash flow. &nbsp;Each of these is more credible if it has BOTH the past performance and the future projections in the same spreadsheet.</p><p>Your spreadsheet should contain a tab for each of these outputs along with an “assumptions” tab and custom detail tabs needed to help calculate the main outputs. We’ll walk through a specific example later in this series so you have a better understanding of what this should look like.</p><p>Because of various accounting nuances – such as fixed asset depreciation and deferring revenue – if you assign ten accountants to finish your books at the end of the year, you’ll get ten different answers for how much profit (or loss) you had in the year. While hopefully not far off from the others, each will have a slightly different report of your “profit” based on their accounting opinions.</p><blockquote><p>However, the balance of your bank account is a specific number to point at; it’s a fact that your ten accountants should agree on.</p></blockquote><p>Therefore, it’s important to remember that your financial model will have your own opinions baked in regarding your profit. This means that examining your cash flow carefully as you fine-tune your business assumptions is critical.</p><p>Having a solid financial model is a significant step in communicating to investors that you are a logical thinker with a defensible plan and clearly understand your business and the levers that drive it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody expects your model to be perfect, as a matter of fact, when we present a model, we always open with the same line:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The only thing we know for sure about this model is that it is wrong. But, if we look critically at it we can better understand the drivers of the business and what we need to be focused on to reduce our risk.” &nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Keep in mind, investors are looking for the big home runs, but they are also looking at reducing their risk. The model can help them get comfortable with the risk.</p><p>– – –</p><p><em>In our next post in this series, we’ll dive in a step-by-step guide of how to build a financial model, starting with the assumptions tab.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://satchel.works/@wclittle/subscribe" target="_blank">Subscribe</a><em>&nbsp;to Will’s newsletter to get notified when the next articles are up.

The “magnonic half-adder” described in “<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41928-020-00485-6&amp;t=NTU0MzgyMTQ2ZjhhMzBlN2JiMmU0Mjg3Njk4ZTBkN2NlZDY4NDViOCxRckVLQTR5Nw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632631998427627520%2Fcomputer-circuits-magnons&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603502105"><i>Nature Electronics</i></a>”, requires just three nanowires, and far less energy than the latest computer chips.</p><p>A team of physicists are marking a milestone in the quest for smaller and more energy-efficient computing: they developed an integrated circuit using magnetic material and magnons to transmit binary data, the 1s and 0s that form the foundation of today’s computers and smartphones.</p><p>The new circuit is extremely tiny, with a streamlined, 2D design that requires about 10 times less energy than the most advanced computer chips available today, which use CMOS technology. While the current magnon configuration is not as fast as CMOS, the successful demonstration can now be explored further for other applications, such as quantum or neuromorphic computing.</p><h2><b>Successful collaboration</b></h2><p>The prototype is the culmination of four years of effort funded through Andrii Chumak’s European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant, and close collaboration with Jun.-Prof. Dr. Philipp Pirro at TUK, and Dr. Qi Wang, who is currently a postdoc at University of Vienna. Univ.-Prof. Chumak started the work at TUK and now leads a research group at University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are very happy since we managed to do what was planned several years ago and it works even better than we expected”, Chumak says. When he first proposed the magnon circuit, his design was very complex. He credits Wang, the lead author of the paper, with making the design “at least 100 times better.” “We see now that magnonics circuits can be as good as CMOS, but this is probably not yet enough if you want to trigger industry. I would assume you have to be still at least 100 times smaller and faster”, says Chumak. “But this circuit opens up fantastic opportunities beyond binary data, for example to quantum magnonic computing at very low temperatures.” Pirro adds: “We are also interested in adapting the circuit for neuromorphic magnonic computers inspired by the functionality of our brain.”</p><h2><b>How it works</b></h2><p>The nanocircuit components measures less than one micrometer, far thinner than a human hair and hardly visible even under a microscope. It comprises of three nanowires made of a magnetic material called yttrium iron garnet. The wires are positioned precisely in relationship to each other to create two “directional couplers” which guide magnons through the wires. Magnons are quanta of spin waves – think of them like ripples on the surface of pond after throwing in a rock, but in this case, the waves are formed by distortions in the magnetic order of a solid material on the quantum level. It took a lot of time and effort to figure out the best nanowire length and spacing to generate the desired outcomes. Wang worked on the project for his Ph.D. at TUK. “This is the 3rd or 4th design”, he says. “I ran a few hundred simulations for different types of half-adders.”</p><p>At the first coupler, where two wires are very close together, the spin wave is split in half. One half proceeds to the second coupler, where it jumps back and forth between the wires. Depending on the amplitude, the wave will exit either the top or bottom wire, which corresponds to binary “1” or “0”, respectively. Since the circuit contains two directional couplers that add together two streams of information, it forms a “half-adder”, one of the most universal components of computer chips. Millions of these circuits can be combined to conduct increasingly complex calculations and functions.</p><p>“What typically requires hundreds of components and 14 transistors in regular computers, here only requires three nanowires, a spin wave, and nonlinear physics”, Pirro says.</p><h2><b>Future applications</b></h2><p>Pirro, who is currently leading the direction of spintronic computing at TUK in the frames of the collaborative research center “Spin+X”, will now explore using the magnon circuit for neuromorphic computing, which approaches data processing not as binary, but more like the human brain. Spin waves are much better suited for the more complex systems and have the potential to carry a great deal more information because they have two parameters – amplitude, which is wave height, and phase, which is the wave angle. In the current demonstration, the team did not use phase as a variable in order to keep it simple for binary data processing. </p><p>“If this device can already compete with CMOS, even if it is not using the full power of the wave-based approach, then we can be quite confident a scheme using the full power of the spin wave can be more efficient than CMOS for certain tasks”, Pirro says. “And the ultimate goal, of course, is to combine the strengths of both CMOS and magnonics technologies together.”

	<p>If you think that the Sahara is covered only by golden dunes and scorched rocks, you aren’t alone. Perhaps it's time to shelve that notion. In an area of West Africa 30 times larger than Denmark, an international team, led by University of Copenhagen and NASA researchers, has counted over 1.8 billion trees and shrubs. The 1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> area covers the western-most portion of the Sahara Desert, the Sahel and what are known as sub-humid zones of West Africa.</p>
<p>"We were very surprised to see that quite a few trees actually grow in the Sahara Desert, because up until now, most people thought that virtually none existed. We counted hundreds of millions of trees in the desert alone. Doing so wouldn't have been possible without this technology. Indeed, I think it marks the beginning of a new scientific era," asserts Assistant Professor Martin Brandt of the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, lead author of <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2824-5">the study’s scientific article, now published in <em>Nature</em></a>.</p>
<p>The work was achieved through a combination of detailed satellite imagery provided by NASA, and deep learning — an advanced artificial intelligence method. Normal satellite imagery is unable to identify individual trees, they remain literally invisible. Moreover, &nbsp;a limited interest in counting trees outside of forested areas led to the prevailing view that there were almost no trees in this particular region. This is the first time that trees across a large dryland region have been counted.</p>
<h2>The role of trees in the global carbon budget</h2>
<p>New knowledge about trees in dryland areas like this is important for several reasons, according to Martin Brandt. For example, they represent an unknown factor when it comes to the global carbon budget:</p>
<p>"Trees outside of forested areas are usually not included in climate models, and we know very little about their carbon stocks. They are basically a white spot on maps and an unknown component in the global carbon cycle," explains Martin Brandt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new study can contribute to better understanding the importance of trees for biodiversity and ecosystems and for the people living in these areas. In particular, enhanced knowledge about trees is also important for developing programmes that promote agroforestry, which plays a major environmental and socio-economic role in arid regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thus, we are also interested in using satellites to determine tree species, as tree types are significant in relation to their value to local populations who use wood resources as part of their livelihoods. Trees and their fruit are consumed by both livestock and humans, and when preserved in the fields, trees have a positive effect on crop yields because they improve the balance of water and nutrients," explains Professor Rasmus Fensholt of the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management.</p>

<figcaption>The red rectangle marks the area where the trees were mapped.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2>Technology with a high potential</h2>
<p>The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of Copenhagen’s Department of Computer Science, where researchers developed the deep learning algorithm that made the counting of trees over such a large area possible.</p>
<p>The researchers show the deep learning model what a tree looks like: They do so by feeding it thousands of images of various trees. Based upon the recognition of tree shapes, the model can then automatically identify and map trees over large areas and thousands of images. The model needs only hours what would take thousands of humans several years to achieve.</p>
<p>"This technology has enormous potential when it comes to documenting changes on a global scale and ultimately, in contributing towards global climate goals. It is a motivation for us to develop this type of beneficial artificial intelligence," says professor and co-author Christian Igel of the Department of Computer Science.</p>
<p>The next step is to expand the count to a much larger area in Africa. And in the longer term, the aim is to create a global database of all trees growing outside forest areas.</p>

    <div>
        <ul>
<li>The researchers counted 1.8 billion trees and shrubs with crowns larger than 3 m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the actual number of trees in the area is even higher.</li>
<li>Deep learning can be characterized as an advanced artificial intelligence method where an algorithm is trained to recognize specific patterns in large amounts of data. The algorithm used in this research was trained using nearly 90,000 images of different trees across a variety of landscapes. </li>

October 21, 2020 | https://ncona.com/2020/10/introduction-to-golang-modules/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ncona.com/2020/10/introduction-to-golang-modules/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Modules are the new way of doing dependency management in Golang.</p>

<p>A module is a collection of packages that are distributed together (e.g. a single binary). A module contains a <code>go.mod</code> file at its root.</p>

<p>With modules, it is not necessary to have our code in <code>$GOPATH/src</code> anymore, so we can create a project anywhere.</p>

<p>Let’s start a new project:</p>



<p>And make it a module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ~/project
go mod init mymodule/hello
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<!--more-->

<p>This creates a <code>go.mod</code> file. Mine looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>module mymodule/hello

go 1.15
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s create a main file in our module:</p>



<p>And add this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>"hello world"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can run our application:</p>



<p>Since the point of modules is managing dependencies, let’s add a dependency to our application:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> <span>"fmt"</span>
<span>import</span> <span>"rsc.io/quote"</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>quote</span><span>.</span><span>Hello</span><span>());</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next time we try to run it, all the dependencies will be downloaded and the dependencies’ versions will be added to <code>go.mod</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>module mymodule/hello

go 1.15

require rsc.io/quote v1.5.2 // indirect
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is also a file named <code>go.sum</code> created. This file contains information about all the dependencies (including dependencies of dependencies):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c h1:qgOY6WgZOaTkIIMiVjBQcw93ERBE4m30iBm00nkL0i8=
golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c/go.mod h1:NqM8EUOU14njkJ3fqMW+pc6Ldnwhi/IjpwHt7yyuwOQ=
rsc.io/quote v1.5.2 h1:w5fcysjrx7yqtD/aO+QwRjYZOKnaM9Uh2b40tElTs3Y=
rsc.io/quote v1.5.2/go.mod h1:LzX7hefJvL54yjefDEDHNONDjII0t9xZLPXsUe+TKr0=
rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0 h1:7uVkIFmeBqHfdjD+gZwtXXI+RODJ2Wc4O7MPEh/QiW4=
rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0/go.mod h1:T1hPZKmBbMNahiBKFy5HrXp6adAjACjK9JXDnKaTXpA=
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both files should be checked into version control to provide reproducible builds.</p>

<p>We can also see all the dependencies in our module using <code>go list</code>:</p>



<p>To see the available versions of a specific module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>go list -m -versions rsc.io/sampler
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can upgrade a package to a specific version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>go get rsc.io/sampler@v1.3.1
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To upgrade to the latest version, just omit the version</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this article we learned how to create a simple module and manage its dependencies. The system seems simple to use, and not having to put all our code in $GOPATH/src is a nice new feature.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <td colspan="3">
      
      <div id="content">
      <p>Some time ago, I wrote a short article called <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/html/">"Writing
HTML in HTML"</a>,
where I explained why I use plain HTML to write, edit and maintain my
web site. As I've been living with my decision to eschew both dynamic
content management systems and static site generators for more than a
year, I've had the chance to reflect upon it, and I think it is time
for me to
update and clarify my original vision.</p>
      <p>In this post, I
want to explore two fundamental principles or criteria that underpinned
my original article, but were more or less unpronounced: <b>sustainability</b> and <b>power</b>. I also want to update you on my current site configuration.</p>
      <p>Before I begin, I should say that these criteria are <em>my</em> criteria, they're what <em>I</em>
value, and don't necessarily line up with what other people value. I think there are others who might value the same
things as I do; others will hopefully find the perspective interesting,
even if they don't ultimately agree.<br>
      </p>
<h3>First criterion: sustainability</h3>
      <p>The criterion of sustainability corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How difficult will it be for me to maintain – over time –<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In my life, this is a rather harsh rule. I know that
every extra step I need to perform in order to do something is going to
make me avoid doing it more. For this reason, I will consider even minor things – like needing to
install a single extra piece of software on my computer, even if it
takes only a second to install – to be lowering the sustainability of the web site. Relevant here is not only the effort required for me to edit the site, but also how likely the site is to merely <em>survive</em> over long periods of time, through server migrations and infrastructure changes.<br>
</p><h4>WordPress<br>
      </h4>
      <p>As such, I am not talking about "ease of use". WordPress is likely the
least difficult way to run a blog, but it is not the most <em>sustainable</em> way, because the effort required to maintain a WordPress site <em>over long periods of time</em> is
higher than a folder of static HTML files. To migrate a WordPress
site to a new server, you need to export the WordPress database from
MySQL on the old server, setup MySQL on the new server and import the
old database. This may not be a huge effort, but it is not as simple,
neither physically nor mentally, as a copying a folder; thus it lowers
the sustainability of the site.<br>
</p>
      <h4>Jekyll<br>
      </h4>
      <p>On the other hand, a <em>generated</em> folder of static HTML files
is not sustainable just because it can easily be copied to a new server
without having to worry about "invisible" databases. While it is easy
to migrate the site to a new server, it is <em>not</em> effortless to
update the contents of the site, because you can't re-generate a Jekyll-driven site
if you don't have Jekyll installed on the computer. Furthermore, it
is not uncommon for there to be differences in behavior between
different versions of the same generator, making it difficult to
maintain the site over long periods of time; if new versions of your
static site generator introduce breaking changes, your site is not
sustainable, because you will have to update its code whenever you
update the generator.</p>
      <h4>HTTPS<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Sustainability
is also the one of the many reasons why my web site is served
over HTTP and not HTTPS. The problem with HTTPS is that you need to get
a certificate from a trusted authority, which either costs
money or is free but needs to be updated every month, and even if you
pay for it, you need to renew the certificate every year or so. If the
operation of your blog
depends on a monthly certificate renewal from Let's Encrypt – even if
the renewal is set up to be automatic – it is less sustainable
than
serving your site over HTTP. HTTP will <em>always</em> be around, will always be supported and will never require a certificate.</p>
      <p>Another problem with HTTPS is that it is very difficult to
revert back to HTTP once you have started using HTTPS. Every outside link to
your web site will be incorrect, and you can't redirect HTTPS traffic
to HTTP without a valid certificate. In other words, once you start
using HTTPS, you will be forever dependent on the certificate renewal
process.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>T</b><b>he more a web site resembles a folder of ungenerated, static HTML files, served over HTTP, the more sustainable it is.</b></span>
As long as the web exists, there will be web servers capable of serving
static HTML files without requiring any extra setup; static HTML is
foolproof. With that said, there are other things you can generally count
on being available without extra setup. One such thing is PHP. A folder
of <em>mostly</em> static HTML pages, enhanced by PHP includes, is nearly as sustainable as a folder of completely static HTML pages.</p>
      
      <h3>Second criterion: power</h3>
      <p>The second criterion, power, corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How limited am I in my creation and maintenance of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the structure of the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?</p></blockquote>
      <p>This
is also a rather important rule in my life, at least as far as
technology is concerned. I like doing things the way I like doing them,
especially when it comes to a creative endeavor – which building a web
site is. I don't like to be hindered by the software I use, unless the
software is good enough to outweigh the irratation provoked by its
limitations.<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Streamlining<br>
      </h4>
      <p>To be fair, to make the creation and maintenance of a site easier and more
powerful in some regards, it seems necessary to introduce limitations
in other regards. For example, if I want an identical navigation menu
on every page, it is wise to use a PHP include or some type of
templating engine; but this, in turn, limits my power to customize the
navigation menu of each page specifically according to that page's
needs. In streamlining the site's navigation menu, some freedom is lost.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This
type of streamlining is not a bad idea. The problem with
most content management systems and static site generators is that they
streamline too much. If I implement a common navigation menu by putting
a PHP include on every page that needs it, then I can choose <em>not</em>
to include it on any given page. But if I implement the navigation menu
by enforcing a single common template for all pages – which is what
most CMSs and SSGs do – then I can not nearly as easily choose <em>not</em>
to include the navigation menu on some of the pages. If I need to do
so, it is possible, but I am forced to work around the system.</p><h4>Structure<br>
      </h4>
      
      <p>Likewise, static site generators like Jekyll usually make it <em>very</em>
hard to freely choose a directory structure for your site. They are
almost always built for very simple purposes: all blog posts go in <i>_posts</i>, and more complex directory structures are usually very difficult to implement, if not impossible. CMSs
are generally more flexible, but they too can be difficult to bend to
your specific needs. Ultimately, in terms of flexibility, a folder of
static, ungenerated HTML beats everything else, especially when
combined with an <i>.htaccess</i> file.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Markup language<br>
      </h4>
      <p>CMSs
and SSGs share the tendency to avoid plain HTML: most
CMSs use a WYSIWYG editor, while SSGs usually use Markdown. This is an
obvious and severe limitation: many things in this very article – such
as the red text or the right-aligned headings – are impossible to write
in Markdown (without reverting to actual HTML inside the Markdown
document). But as I mentioned in my original post, there are actually
HTML editors that don't suck, even WYSIWYG editors. I am using <a href="http://kompozer.sourceforge.net/">KompoZer</a>, one such editor, to write this very post.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>If you use a CMS or SSG, you constantly have to battle its limitations.</b></span>
You should consider whether its benefits are great enough to justify
this struggle. They might be – but I suspect that, for many
technologically talented people, they are not.<br>
</p>
      <h3>My current solution</h3>
      <p>Perhaps my own web
site (the one you're visiting right now) can serve as inspiration as to
how to build a web site according to these criteria. It is currently
implemented in the following way:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The site is a folder of <em>mostly</em> static HTML files, enhanced by zero, one or two PHP includes, depending on the page:</p>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigation menu</li>
          <li>Comments section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The
comments system, written in PHP, works by
appending new comments to an HTML file located in the same directory as
the page
being commented on. This HTML file is included via PHP on the page.
This system is not nearly as efficient as a database-driven one, but it
is drastically more sustainable<small><big>. (You can try out the system
below.)</big><br>
        </small></p>
        <li>
          <p>I have an <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/articles.xml">RSS feed</a>
implemented as a PHP script, which pulls the posts to include in the
feed from the site's front page and subsequently extracts the contents
of each post from their respective file. The front page is updated
manually.<br>
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All files upon which the various pages on the site depend – the stylesheet,
the navigation menu script and the comments script – are put in a
folder at the site's root named <i>1</i>. If I ever choose to re-write the site, I can keep this <i>1</i>
folder, so that the old pages still work, and put the new files, like
the stylesheets and scripts for the new pages, into another folder
named <i>2</i> – and so on forever.</p>
        </li>
        <p><small>In
my initial article, I put forward the idea of
putting all files upon which a page depends in that page's directory.
Pages would then be self-contained. I ultimately decided against this,
because a) it is useful&nbsp;for some pages to share some common files,
such as a stylesheet, and b) if the stylesheet always resides at the
same URL, browsers will save it in the cache. </small></p>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, I have introduced some dynamism to the site,
most notably the comments system. (It has bothered me that very few
blogs support comments nowadays. How am I supposed to respond to a blog post?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The giant robot looks like a WED Treadwell, <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/robots-i-love">my favorite robot</a> of all the Star Wars droids. I admit, I was worried that it would look organic, like a Sentinel from The Matrix, with wriggling Dr. Octopus arms and pinchy pincers that pinch. But I'm calmed by the robot's EVE-like exterior.</p>
<p>The room is sterile. A dozen masked, gloved attendants in blue buzz. I imagine I'm an astronaut about to step into the rocketship capsule.</p>
<p>Except I won't be going anywhere on this particular journey, unless something goes very, very wrong. In fact, I've already been asked repeatedly by various staffers to describe what I'm expecting to happen in this room over the next few hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm here to remove my sigmoid colon via robotic surgery because of the cancerous tumor inside."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm 34 years old. It's October 12th, 2020. Five weeks ago I was diagnosed with colon cancer.</p>
<h2>Stool, bloody stool</h2>
<p>I've always been a standing wiper. Not sure entirely why. I must have once, accidentally, touched a load of poo during a seated wipe. That sort of thing can change a person.</p>
<p>This charming anecdote does factor into our story, because it means I've always had a pretty good sense for my poo. Consistency, quality, and color, both in the bowl and on the TP. Did you know, there's even a seven-stage scientific classification system for your poo, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_stool_scale">Bristol stool scale</a>?!</p>

<p>I first noticed blood two or three years ago. On a monthly or so cadence, I'd wipe and notice a reddish tinge. Not bright red, more like muddy-red. Poopy-red. Initially, I thought little of it. Just a minor curiousity. It certainly didn't happen every time. Still, I decided to check off the <code>Blood in stool</code> box on the forms at my annual physical with my primary care doctor that year.</p>
<p>A brief aside on the phrase "your primary care doctor." Like in <em>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</em>, the last doctor I really thought of as "my doctor" was my pediatrician. Since "becoming an adult", I've lived in three cities in two countries, which means that I've generally had no idea who my primary care doctor is or was, only that I'd need to find one to give me a referral to get this wart on my foot removed.</p>

<p>Anyway, this season's Dr. Who told me not to worry about the blood. "It's probably hemorrhoids."</p>
<p><em>WTF is a hemorrhoid?</em> I wondered to myself as I said to him, "Sounds good." Googled it after, and I learned that it's a vein that pokes out a little in your butt and doesn't really want to be poking out a little, so it bleeds. Seems like a thing that can happen, so I more or less returned to regularly scheduled programming and just dealt with the occasional poopy-red wipe. This doc also said I probably don't need to come for a physical for a few years, that annual physicals are a myth, dry land in a water world.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2020. Everything sucks. And the bloody wipes are making a resurgence. Because, of course, they are. About four months ago I noticed that my first poop of the day (I usually go 2x) would have this purple-red streak embedded in it, like a racing stripe from hell. And it would happen almost without fail every single morning. That just didn't seem right, no matter what Doctors of Physicals Past told me. And then one morning I felt like I had actual blood dripping from my butt.</p>
<p>Now I consider myself to be a mostly healthy person. I eat fairly well (even though I enjoy the occasional sourdough loaf and hazy IPA), I run and bike and hike regularly, I ran an IRONMAN in 2016 and a few ultramarathons since. I also don't like being sick (who does?). But, like with most things in my life, I want to be "good" at health. An ideal dental appointment for me would go something like this, "Wow, Charlie, these are the straightest, whitest teeth we've ever seen. We'd like you to come in and be the model for our Instagram ads and also be our 3D teeth model for dentures. Congratulations. Here's <em>two</em> free toothbrushes. You also never need to floss again."</p>
<p>Anything that deviates from that ideal makes me squirm and I do think I can fix anything. For what it's worth I still believe that, if I ever encounter a blue flower on a mountain-top, I'm only a few months of mystical training away from becoming Batman. I already have the cape (it's actually a Harry Potter robe, but, hey, I'm scrappy).</p>
<p>At the same time, I counterweight this with a mild touch of hypochondria. I'll see the poison oak in the mistletoe, so to speak. In this case it was a gift.  I googled again for <em>stool, bloody stool</em> and the dreaded <em>colon cancer</em> came back. Last time, I averted my eyes from these search results. But the bloody racing stripes weren't going away. I needed to get myself checked out.</p>
<p>Then I remembered an email from work: I was eligible for a <a href="http://members.onemedical.com/membership_referrals?code=cha0014&amp;source=sa">OneMedical</a> membership. I knew there was hype about OneMedical, certainly I've seen the billboards, but I still wasn't exactly sure what they were all about. It had been a few years since my last physical, as you know, so I was primary-care-less, with a bloody problem on my hands. I downloaded the OneMedical app, uploaded a photo of my insurance card, beep-boop, and I've got an appointment with a new doc in a few days in one of their nearby clinics. Already, I loved the experience - I could text my questions any time (see <em>foot wart</em> above). I'd describe OneMedical as a network of clinics with an app for scheduling appointments and texting with a doc. Sure, ZocDoc kinda does the scheduling thing, but Zocdoc feels like you're sifting through the classifieds. Gimme some non-user-generated-ratings-based curation, please. </p>
<p>So, I met with the doc, liked him a lot, discussed my bloody poops, and sheepishly asked if he'd be my new primary care. He agreed, and he also referred me to UCSF for a colonoscopy. Sure, I'm young, and it's probably hemorrhoids, we agreed, but it's the only way to be sure.</p>
<p>After some jiggling about with the referral documentation, we finally get the colonoscopy scheduled for a few weeks later on Sept 9th.</p>
<p>Then, on August 28th, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman">Chadwick Boseman</a> died of complications from colon cancer.</p>
<p>I wasn't freaked out. Okay, yes, I was very freaked out.</p>
<h2>Colonoscopies are not bad</h2>
<p>What's a colonoscopy? It's a surgical procedure where the doctor goes all the way up your butt to see what's going on in there. You are completely knocked out, so you feel nothing. The only thing you need to do is what we in the business like to call "bowel prep."</p>
<p>Allow me to describe bowel prep: the day before the procedure, you will poop your ever-living guts out for a few hours until you are clean-as-a-whistle, stem to stern. They'll give you a prescription for a gigantic jug of clear laxatives that you'll drink every 15 minutes or so for a few hours. In today's toilet-paper hoarding economy, I'd make sure that you are stocked up, because this gets messy.</p>
<p>Other then the laxatives, you're allowed to drink clear liquids - which is confusing because you can enjoy such clear liquids as black coffee, Gatorade, broth, even green jello.</p>
<p>But that's it. Easy. I watched Stranger Things season 3 again during my bowel prep day. Might not have been the best choice, as I intermittently had to pause Netflix to contribute my own liquified form of the Mind-Flayer, but it got the job done, and I cried my way thru Dustin and Suzie's hymn to childhood, again, as expected.</p>
<p>Okay, next, I woke up on September 9th. My appointment is around 2 PM. Normal day, right?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>
<p>I decide to walk over to the UCSF Parnassus building in the creepy Mars firelight, imagining I'm the last man on Earth (and hoping I don't step on my reading glasses). Carly makes a plan to pick me up in a few hours in our car.</p>
<p>As expected, the procedure was painless. My only bit of further colonoscopy advice here is to ALWAYS bring a book with you, to every single medical appointment you have, because there's always going to be some sort of delay or waiting room.</p>
<p>An hour or so later, I woke up feeling the feels of that post-anesthesia giddiness. Except no one else was happy. Carly was in the room, a surprise to me. And my doctor looked quite serious.</p>
<p>In addition to two small polyps (which she removed), my colonoscopy surgeon found a tumor in my sigmoid colon. At this point, I don't know a sigmoid colon from a semi-colon, but I knew it wasn't good news. Go 2020!</p>
<p>Despite the odds (my youth, my health), I now had cancer. Well, I probably had it for awhile, but we just found out I had it.</p>
<p>My doc said I'd need to meet with <a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/clinics/center-for-colorectal-surgery">UCSF's colorectal surgery team</a>, and I'd also need to get CT scans ("cat scans") to see if the cancer had spread anywhere else in my body.</p>
<p>And so began one of the worst weeks of our lives.</p>
<h2>A brief family history</h2>
<p>Let's talk about the odds for a moment.</p>

<p>We've already discussed my vigorous, proto-Batman level of health. And how I'm a fresh-faced, occasionally-bearded, 34 year old with the heart of a child and the strength of a chimpanzee (no, that's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanzee">humanzee</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of unfortunate genetics, it turns out that I have some family history of colon cancer. </p>
<p>Here's the scoop: my pops (that's cool talk for Dad) has had benign (non-cancerous) polyps in his previous colonoscopies. What's a poylp? It's a little growth thingy in your colon that may evolve into a tumor. Just like how a Charmander becomes a Charmeleon, polyps can grow bigger and more serious with more destructive power. Polyps are usually just snipped out during your colonoscopy and sent off for pathology (aka to see if they have cancer in them). Most do not. This is the case with my dad's polyp experience. Even though none of his have been cancerous, he still needs to go in for colonoscopies more regularly than those who don't have polyps.</p>
<p>My own tumor began as a lowly polyp, perhaps some ten years ago. We don't know exactly. But if I'd …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Big Oil Wants Climate Change</h3><p>In this post, we read, listen, act, and reflect on October's topic: Big Oil. This blog has been adapted from our sustainability newsletter, so please sign up for it to stay in the loop. </p><p>What’s covered: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>READ</em></strong><em>: Exxon's plan to increase emissions to match the country of Greece's CO2 output</em></li><li><strong><em>LISTEN</em></strong><em>: The climate conspiracy funded by Big Oil</em></li><li><strong><em>ACT</em></strong><em>: Coming 10/21</em></li><li><strong><em>REFLECT</em></strong><em>: Coming 10/28</em></li></ul><p>‍</p></div><div><h3>This week's conversation starter</h3><p>‍</p><p>This prompt is for you to ask your friends and family - especially if they're thinking about climate change less than you are. I'll share one every week.</p><p>What do you think about renewable energy? Have you considered using it?</p><p>‍</p><h3>READ: Facts about Exxon and Big Oil</h3><p>The following is taken from this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-05/exxon-carbon-emissions-and-climate-leaked-plans-reveal-rising-co2-output">Bloomberg</a> report and this <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/05/leaked-documents-reveal-exxonmobil-plans-to-increa/">Motley Fool</a> article (I recommend reading the Bloomberg one). Both articles reference a leaked Exxon internal document.</p><p>Exxon put out a press release claiming that the Bloomberg report is misleading, but I think I'll take my chances and stand by this report. You can read Exxon's statement <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2020/1005_ExxonMobil-statement-regarding-inaccurate-Bloomberg-news-story">here</a>.</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Exxon has an ambitious plan... to increase fossil fuel production.</strong> Their own assessment of their $210 billion investment strategy shows yearly CO2 emissions rising 17% by 2025. Yes, <em>rising</em>.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Exxon wants to compete with Greece, I guess?</strong> This "ambitious" plan would increase their annual emissions by as much as the output of the ENTIRE NATION of Greece. That's a whole country!<br>‍</li><li><strong>The number is an underestimate.</strong> Basically, Exxon wants to ramp up oil production. This would <em>increase</em> CO2 emissions by 21 million metric tons by 2025. This doesn't account for what they already emit. (Emission, more like omission, amirite?) Exxon's leaked documents estimate total emissions of 143 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2025.<br>‍</li><li><strong>They're trying to sneak past you.</strong> They talk big game about their emissions reduction strategy, but that's to distract you from the fact that they emit WAY more than they reduce — the reduction is likely just a publicity play at this time.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>There's good news, though. Plus, more info on the history of this colossal problem. Sources are linked if you want to learn more.</p><p>‍</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>There's good news!</strong> Exxon's competitors, like Shell and BP, have <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/04/16/net-zero-emissions-shell-oil-industry-gas/">committed</a> to net-zero emissions targets by 2050 because of shareholder demands. Putting pressure on corporations works and it's one of the best ways we can take action as individuals. I'm here to show you how.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Only 20 companies have contributed to a third of all CO2 emissions.</strong> Yeah, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions">here's the list.<br>‍</a></li><li><strong>We let this happen because of </strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/06/15/united-states-spend-ten-times-more-on-fossil-fuel-subsidies-than-education/#5ffb994c4473"><strong>politics</strong></a><strong> and capitalism</strong>. Fossil fuel companies get hella money from the government. In the US, fossil fuel subsidies are greater than federal education spending. I'll talk more about the link between politics, money, and Big Oil in a later module.</li></ul><p>‍</p></div><div><h3>This week's conversation starter</h3><p>‍</p><p>This prompt is for you to ask your friends and family - especially if they're thinking about climate change less than you are. I'll share one every week.</p><p><strong><em>Why do you think our weather patterns change from year to year? What's the wildest weather event you've experienced in your life?</em></strong></p><p>‍</p><h3>LISTEN: How powerful is Big Oil?</h3><p><br>Confession: I didn't know about climate deception until earlier this year. I mean, I knew that oil companies were kinda responsible for covering up climate change, but I didn't understand that it was a whole ass conspiracy theory.</p><p><br>The main video I wanted to share with you below has more facts, but I <em>had</em> to show you this 3-minute one for #ConspiracyVibes. Honestly, it almost seems fake with all the eerie background music. I wish it was.</p><p><br>So,<strong> option 1</strong>, watch the spooky video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMd6hE6Rr6M&amp;ab_channel=TheYEARSProject&amp;utm_source=Soapbox+Project&amp;utm_campaign=8cc7aba228-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_10_14_06_25&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_62cc86bc0a-8cc7aba228-" target="_blank">Big Oil Knew: The Confusion Memo.</a> It's short and has a good timeline on how Exxon and its buddies created a decades-long cover up that's made its way to the American White House today.</p><p><br><strong>Option 2:</strong> Watch this other NowThis video "How Powerful is Big Oil?" I've embedded it below, and if you keep scrolling, I've included 3 facts to encourage you to watch. It's only 3 min - you might as well exit out of this newsletter and check out the video, since it's basically the same amount of time.</p><figure id="w-node-b6d1509964ec-c0ebf208"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DIHIP2hHIE"></iframe></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Fact snack | Video Recap</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Trillionaire, baby:</strong> Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States (in that order) are the largest global oil producers. The top 5 oil companies' revenues accounted for over 10% of US GDP — about 2 trillion USD! Yes, <em>five</em> companies' revenues equated to a tenth of US GDP. If you're not from the US, that translates to "I'm so rich I can do whatever I want without consequences".<br> </li><li><strong>Swaying elections is easy... with enough money.</strong> Oil companies in 2016 gave ~57 MILLION bucks to the political campaign. As we know, the election of the US president has far-reaching global consequences. Oh, and over 50 of that million went to the Republican party.<br> </li><li><strong>Each year, approximately 4 BILLION in taxpayer dollars is given back to oil companies.</strong> So basically, oil companies are hella rich, they have seemingly unlimited political power, and the money that they give to politicians is barely a cost to them because they get it right back.</li></ul><p><br>Today's Changeletter was a bit doom and gloom, but I just want to let it sink in that we can only substantially fight climate change when we act on a corporate level. And I see y'all out there with your corporate employers - but don't worry. We'll help you make a plan, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/125283609649/?utm_source=Soapbox+Project&amp;utm_campaign=8cc7aba228-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_10_14_06_25&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_62cc86bc0a-8cc7aba228-" target="_blank">starting with our voting party.</a></p><p>‍</p></div><div id="act"><h3>ACT: 3 baby steps to take down the bad guy, Big Oil</h3><p>‍</p><p> It seems like Big Oil was the right topic to pick this month. In our Listen module, we talked about how much unchecked power they have and a few days ago, the President of the United States "hypothetically" asked Exxon for a $25 million campaign donation. Exxon <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-exxon-mobil-fundraising-call-claim-never-happened-2020-10">denied it</a>, just like they <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2020/1005_ExxonMobil-statement-regarding-inaccurate-Bloomberg-news-story">denied</a> wanting to increase CO2 emissions this year.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Today, I'm listing out 3 actions you can take towards the fight for a greener, less oil-dependent future. </strong></p><p>‍</p><p>It's time to end our reliance on Big Oil. It'll take a while to get there, but we can start in reeeaaaallly easy ways. I've done all three of these only after COVID started, so I&nbsp;believe in you to also take the first step. Please reach out if you need more resources -- we're here for you at team@soapboxproject.org or on social media.</p><p>‍</p><p>Anyway, here it is, easy, medium, and medium-advanced:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Divest from Big Oil.</strong> Do you have oil and gas stocks in your portfolio? Can you switch them out for renewable energy stocks and ETFs? Check out these <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/renewable-energy-stocks-to-consider">recommendations</a> and let me know what you think.<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Switch your bank.</strong> A majority of investment banks including Chase <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/03/18/jpmorgan-chase-tops-dirty-list-of-35-fossil-fuel-funding-banks/#615a76515dfe">invest heavily in fossil fuels.</a> I recently used <a href="https://mightydeposits.com/">Mighty Deposits</a> to find a bank that works for me — instead of investing in dirty energy, my money is going towards building community and boosting small businesses.<p>‍</p></li><li><strong>Use less plastic.</strong> You're probably slammed this week with emails/calls/texts from political campaigns.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I just ran into a thought-provoking little issue in the source code of
HyperRogue, and I thought I’d share it here.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue">HyperRogue</a> is quite possibly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004073813/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/09/28/hyperrogue-non-euclidean-roguelike/">the
most mind-expanding roguelike in existence</a>.
And it’s written 100% in C++! Even the web version is
compiled with <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html">Emscripten</a>.
Okay, there’s about 2000 lines of Java for the Android version, but the
bulk of the code — 135,000 lines — is C++.</p>

<p>The code’s native language is C++11; that is, it uses lots of C++11 (<code>unordered_map</code>,
<code>std::move</code>, variadic templates) but it doesn’t use any C++14 features (it used one
generic lambda for a while, but I submitted a patch to remove it, and the patch was
accepted). So it’s C++11, and <em>also</em> it’s C++14.</p>

<p>But it’s not <em>quite</em> C++17.</p>

<p>Because it does this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>using namespace std;

template&lt;class T&gt; int size(const T&amp; x) {
    return x.size();
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then it does things like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
  vptr[cl.lst[i]] = addRugpoint(shmup::ggmatrix(cl.lst[i])*C0, cl.dists[i]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Okay, it’s C++11, but it’s not quite <em>idiomatic</em> C++11. It’s quite dense, and has a bit of a phobia
about ranged for-loops.</p>

<p>But then, everyone’s codebase has its idiosyncrasies. When the end result
is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7QO9sypSfM&amp;t=5m29s">this good</a>, you can’t complain too much
about the author’s whitespace.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-the-problem">So what’s the problem?</h2>

<p>The problem is that C++17 introduces <code>std::size</code>. So Clang complains:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>./rug.cpp:585:18: error: call to 'size' is ambiguous
  for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
                 ^~~~
/usr/include/c++/v1/iterator:1584:16: note: candidate
      function [with _Cont = std::__1::vector&lt;hr::cell *, std::__1::allocator&lt;hr::cell *&gt; &gt;]
constexpr auto size(const _Cont&amp; __c) -&gt; decltype(__c.size()) { return __c.size(); }
               ^
./hyper.h:400:23: note: candidate function [with T = std::__1::vector&lt;hr::cell *, std::__1::allocator&lt;hr::cell *&gt; &gt;]
template&lt;class T&gt; int size(const T&amp; x) {return x.size(); }
                      ^
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Clang complains about 600 times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git grep '[^.&gt;a-zA-Z0-9_]size(' | wc -l
     587
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So the author tried <a href="https://github.com/zenorogue/hyperrogue/commit/d3200253db6866ed278540e136a7464e14c1d11a">replacing <code>using namespace std;</code> with a list of explicit <code>using</code>-directives</a>.
Unfortunately, this doesn’t help. We’re getting something we don’t expect out of <code>namespace std</code>,
but it’s not because we <code>using</code>ed the namespace. It’s because of <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl">argument-dependent lookup (ADL)</a>.
We made an unqualified call to <code>size</code>, where one of the arguments was a <code>std::vector</code>. This unqualified call,
by ADL, naturally finds any function named <code>size</code> in any <em>associated namespace</em> of the argument type
<code>std::vector</code> (and, incidentally, also considers namespace <code>hr</code>, although
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0934r0.pdf">this has been widely regarded as a bad move</a>.)</p>

<p>So eliminating the <code>using namespace std;</code> directive is a great idea but doesn’t help at all.</p>

<h2 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h2>

<p>I thought of a bunch of alternatives.</p>

<p>(A), we could change the name of our <code>size</code> function from <code>size</code> to <code>Size</code> (or <code>sz</code>, or <code>hrsize</code>, or whatever).
Update all the call-sites, and we’re done. This continues performing ADL on every call-site, but now ADL
doesn’t find any functions named <code>Size</code> (or whatever) <em>except</em> for the one we intend, so we’re good.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;Size(cl.lst); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr>

<p>(B), we could leave our <code>size</code> function alone, and fully-qualify every <em>call</em> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;::size(cl.lst); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This says, “Please look <em>only</em> in the global namespace for <code>size</code>” — that is, it turns off ADL entirely.
So we’re good.</p>

<p>Minor digression: Super C++ geeks might have noticed that <code>&lt;:</code> is a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_alternative">digraph</a>,
so that in C++03 the above code would have been parsed as a syntax error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i[:size(cl.lst); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This has been fixed since C++11: <code>&lt;::</code> is a sort of a “trigraph” that overrides the usual meaning
of <code>&lt;:</code> in the same way as <code>&lt;:</code> overrides the usual meaning of <code>&lt;</code>. The underlying mechanism is similar
to how C++11 doesn’t get confused by the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> in <code>set&lt;set&lt;int&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>(C), we could simply ifdef out our global <code>size</code> whenever we’re in C++17 mode. Then our call sites will
do ADL lookup on <code>size</code>, and find only <em>one</em> candidate: <code>std::size</code>. So they’ll be happy. But this
comes with two downsides.</p>

<p>First, it’s surprisingly hard to detect “C++17 mode” in this case. The system Clang on my MacBook
doesn’t support <code>-std=c++17</code> yet; it only has <code>-std=c++1z</code>, which doesn’t increase the value of
the <code>__cplusplus</code> macro. So we can’t reliably test for <code>__cplusplus &gt;= 201703L</code>. But we can work around
this by adding a config macro <span><code>-DUSE_STDSIZE</code></span> or whatever.</p>

<p>Second, HyperRogue’s global function template <code>size</code> is not a drop-in replacement for <code>std::size</code>!
<code>std::size</code> returns <code>size_t</code>; our global <code>size</code> returns <code>int</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>./rug.cpp:585:17: warning: comparison of integers of different signs: 'int' and 'decltype(__c.size())' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Wsign-compare]
  for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
               ~^~~~~~~~~~~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could work around <em>that</em> by passing <code>-Wno-sign-compare</code>, but then we’d miss bugs.
Or we could add an explicit cast to <code>int</code> in any of several ways:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  for(int i=0; i&lt;(int)size(cl.lst); i++)

  for(int i=0; i&lt;int(size(cl.lst)); i++)

  for(int i=0; i&lt;static_cast&lt;int&gt;(size(cl.lst)); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that we’d need to add those explicit casts even in places the compiler <em>didn’t</em> complain.
Otherwise Murphy’s Law says that we’d hit at least one instance of something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>auto i = size(vec);
double d = foo();
double negated_if_empty = d * (i - 1);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we don’t want to audit all 587 call-sites looking for things like that.</p>

<hr>

<p>(D) — an improvement on (C) — we could eliminate our global <code>size</code> <em>and</em> all its call-sites.
Just inline what it would have done, in C++17 and C++11 alike.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  for(int i=0; i&lt;(int)cl.lst.size(); i++)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is my preferred solution, since it turns out that we can implement it as a series of
mechanical replacements using <code>sed</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sed -i -e 's/size(\*it)/it-&gt;size()/g' langen.cpp
sed -i -e 's/\([^a-z]\)size(\([a-zA-Z0-9_.:][][a-zA-Z0-9_.:]*\))/\1(int)\2.size()/g' `find . -name '*.cpp'` *.h
sed -i -e 's/\([^a-z]\)size(\([a-zA-Z0-9_.:]*-&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9_.:][][a-zA-Z0-9_.:]*\))/\1(int)\2.size()/g' *.cpp
sed -i -e 's/size(currentmap-&gt;allcells())/(int)currentmap-&gt;allcells().size()/g' *.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This does introduce a lot of redundancy; for example, it rewrites</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if(size(str) == 0) return 0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>into</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if((int)str.size() == 0) return 0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>when a human being would have rewritten it as</p>

<div><div><pre><code>if(str.empty()) return 0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But at least it gets the thing compiling in C++17 mode without breaking C++11 mode, and
we can go back and fix up individual call-sites on an ad-hoc basis the next time that particular
area of the code is being worked on.</p>

<hr>

<p>(E), we could do that ad-hoc work right now. For example, our original example</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;size(cl.lst); i++)
  vptr[cl.lst[i]] = addRugpoint(shmup::ggmatrix(cl.lst[i])*C0, cl.dists[i]);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>could be rewritten by hand into</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (auto ld : hr::zip(cl.lst, cl.dists)) {
  vptr[ld[0]] = addRugpoint(shmup::ggmatrix(ld[0])*C0, ld[1]);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>with an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8511035/sequence-zip-function-for-c11">appropriate definition</a>
of <code>zip</code>. (And notice that we’re <code>::</code>-qualifying the call, so that we won’t have to
do this whole thing over again when <code>std::zip</code> inevitably arrives in a future standard!)</p>

<p>But this is basically saying “let’s do a code audit on 587 ad-hoc call sites,” which
isn’t super enticing.</p>

<h2 id="dont-do-that-then">Don’t do that then</h2>

<p>In our case we actually got <em>lucky</em> that our code failed to compile.
The absolute worst case would have been if our global <code>size</code> (returning a signed type)
were <em>silently a worse match</em> than C++17’s <code>std::size</code> (returning an unsigned type),
so that all our math silently went wrong.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, C++ doesn’t have a really great solution here. Future standards can add
names into <code>namespace std</code>, which can then break your existing code’s unqualified calls
by causing unwanted ADL.</p>

<p>The only answer I can really think of is — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri3aL8At44I&amp;t=1m25s"><em>Don’t do that, then.</em></a>
Just like in my <code>zip</code> example above: in our C++ programs, we need to maintain a good
intuitive sense for when some unqualified name (like <code>begin</code>, or <code>size</code>, or <code>zip</code>)
is <em>likely</em> to get stepped on in a future standard, and <em>avoid using that name today</em>,
even if it has not <em>yet</em> been stepped on.
This is arguably a very unfortunate state of affairs… but it’s the state of affairs
we’ve got.</p>

<p><em>Avoid making ADL calls to functions with common names.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE, 2019-05-20:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/commit/61603736e7c9092e0df68d4dd8c87f33eb2e603d">LLVM/Clang just ran into the same issue with a function named <code>apply</code>.</a></p>

<p>Two years ago, we set out to build the best search engine for JavaScript developers. Pika — the original project codename — was designed to help you find better open source packages using data and insights that other search engines ignored. Package size, number of dependencies, side effects, ability to bundle &amp; tree-shake efficiently… Pika analyzed every package to help you make the best choice in less time.</p>



<p>Today, we’re excited to launch our v2 search engine featuring <strong><a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack Discover</a></strong>. Discover combines human-reviewed package recommendations with a quality-focused. search algorithm to help you find the best JavaScript packages, faster than ever.</p>



<h3>Solving the open source discovery problem</h3>



<p>Javascript has evolved, but the way that we find packages is still far too time-consuming. Finding the right package for your project involves a wild dance between <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a>, Google, “this vs. that” blog posts, <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">bundlephobia</a>, <a href="https://npm.anvaka.com/#/">dependency tree visualizers</a>, Quora, Stack Overflow… </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="455" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2.png 1000w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2-300x137.png 300w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-20-at-8.36.57-PM-2-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption>An actual issue that I was once assigned at work.</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re in a rush, you might just grab the most popular package and hope for the best. For example, the #1 recommended “date/time” package on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=date%20time%20">npm’s official search engine</a> would be the popular package named “moment”. You install it, build on top of it, deploy your site to production, and… BAM! <a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721">Google’s official auditing tool throws a warning</a> when you go to test your website before launch:</p>



<figure><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1304676118822174721"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhM0XE3UwAA2Co5?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Replace unnecessarily large JavaScript libraries"></a><figcaption><em><a href="https://twitter.com/addyosmani">@addyosmani</a>: “Lighthouse in @ChromeDevTools now recommends smaller libraries that improve bundle size.</em>“</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out, popularity and search algorithms only tell half of the story. A search algorithm can’t tell you that earlier this year the official Moment.js docs were also updated to say: <em>“<a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/">We would like to discourage Moment from being used in new projects going forward.”</a></em></p>



<p>Finding the right package for your project requires <strong>context. </strong>If a package claims to be widely-used, it’s essential to look deeper. Is it still popular today? Is it well-maintained? Or, has something better come along? Has it been abandoned by the original author? </p>



<p>Gathering this context yourself is a time consuming and imperfect process. So, we decided to bring the context to you.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="535" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1024x535.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1024x535.jpg 1024w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-768x401.jpg 768w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-1536x802.jpg 1536w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.34.14-AM-1-2048x1069.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3>Skypack Discover: Recommended packages, curated by humans</h3>



<p>Skypack Discover is a curated, up-to-date list of the top recommended packages for popular search terms. It’s like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/">Wirecutter</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/30/9416579/spotify-discover-weekly-online-music-curation-interview">Spotify playlists</a>, but for open source JavaScript.</p>



<p>Skypack Discover cuts through the noise to surface the best packages that match your search. We look at factors like package size, performance, documentation, quality, degree of maintenance, community support and more. If a popular package has been abandoned or better alternatives exist, you won’t find it in Discover.</p>



<p>In addition to package recommendations, you also get additional resources linked directly in your results page: relevant blog posts, articles, video walkthroughs and documentation can all help you make your package decision faster and easier.</p>



<p>Today, over 100 popular search terms feature Skypack Discover results. Starting next month, we’ll begin publishing detailed write-ups of our recommendations: how we arrived at our top picks and our thinking behind them.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, it’s up to you to choose the best package for your project. And now, Skypack Discover can help.</p>



<h3>Skypack CDN: Try out any package, right in the browser</h3>



<p>Installing and testing a package locally can introduce an entirely new struggle, best documented in this <a href="https://lea.verou.me/2020/05/todays-javascript-from-an-outsiders-perspective/">brutally honest experience</a> by Lea Verou.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1.png" alt="" width="966" height="150" srcset="https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1.png 740w, https://www.skypack.dev/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-21-at-1.36.46-AM-1-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px"><figcaption>CDN code snippets on every package page!</figcaption></figure>



<p>Skypack makes trying out packages so much easier with a ready-to-go <a href="http://www.skypack.dev/">Skypack CDN</a> link on every package page. With Skypack CDN, you can load and run any package directly in the browser, on demand. There’s nothing to install and no tools to run. As long as the package wasn’t designed for the server, it should run on Skypack.</p>



<p>To try out a package yourself, find it on <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/">skypack.dev</a> and then click the “Edit on CodePen” button on the package page. You’ll be instantly transported to a full <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> IDE containing your Skypack import, ready to go. <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> runs entirely in the browser, so there’s no slow startup or unnecessary wait-time required. Just an instant IDE, ready to play.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Due to the nature of the app here, I want to start this blog post with a disclaimer:</p>
    <p>This describes a <em>minor</em> security flaw in the app which has no impact on its ability to function as part of a track &amp; trace system. I also want to be explicitly clear that this bug does not have any privacy impact whatsoever. Lastly, there is nothing nefarious about this bug. It's a mistake (largely on the part of a third-party dependency) and nothing more, one that is easily (and commonly) made.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 Android app, the official contact tracing app for England and Wales, uses signed JWT tokens for its “scan into a venue” feature but does not properly validate the signatures, meaning anyone could have forged their own venue QR codes.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is due to a mixture of JWTs being fundamentally difficult to verify correctly, and a particularly awful JWT library API.</p>

<p>I was able to discover the vulnerability from reading the source code, and getting the relevant app code running on my computer in a test harness to experiment with it.</p>

<p>I reported the vulnerability to the NHS team who fixed it very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="the-full-story">The Full Story</h2>

<p>It all started, as many things do, with <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361">a Tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>okay i actually really wanted to know and its a JWT with</p><p>like</p><p>the whole dang address</p><p>and the name of the place just for shits and giggles <a href="https://t.co/1vx0bTD9zi">pic.twitter.com/1vx0bTD9zi</a></p></div>— laura mcflurry (@freezydorito) <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2020</a></blockquote>


<div><p>For those of you who don't know, these QR codes are for venues (such as pubs and bars) to display so customers can check in via the NHS (National Health Service) mobile app. This makes it faster and more convenient to track who was at the venue, in case they need to be contacted in the event someone else there tested positive for Coronavirus.</p></div>

<p>For whatever reason, the NHS venue QR codes are JWTs, and they are cryptographically signed.</p>

<p>Like anyone in security, as soon as I heard the letters “JWT” I thought: “I wonder if they got the signature checking correct”.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: they didn’t:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle.png"><img src="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle-thumb.png" alt="A screenshot of a mobile phone app: Green check mark. Title: Successful check-in. Large text: Barnard Castle Eye Testing Facility. Smaller test: 30 Sep 2020, 12:53. Thank you for scanning. You have now checked in! You'll be automatically checked out at midnight or when you scan another official NHS QR code. Button: Back to home. Link: Cancel this check-in."></a></p>

<h2 id="background-jwts--signing">Background: JWTs &amp; Signing</h2>

<p>In case you don’t know what a JWT is, it’s an entirely unnecessary and rather over-complicated spec for encoding data in JSON format and: cryptographically signing it, so it cannot be altered; encrypting it, so it cannot be read; both; or – popularly (if accidentally) – neither.</p>

<p>This post is about signed JWTs, and forging signed JWTs, so I’m not going to mention encryption any more. From here on in, every time I say “JWT” I mean “unencrypted, but possibly signed, JWT”.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know everything about JWTs to follow along here, but you do need to know this much: A JWT consists of three parts: a , a <span>payload</span>, and a <span>signature</span> (optional). Here’s an example:</p>

<pre>.<span>eyJuYW1lIjoiem9mcmV4IiwibWVzc2FnZSI6ImhlbGxvLCB3b3JsZCEifQ</span>.<span>40IhxsQj3rVqfQSpdzZTroSs1onXrTJUsy6yC1SadK0</span></pre>

<p>Each part is Base64 encoded, which isn’t important here, and decoded it looks like this:</p>

<pre>.<span>{"name":"zofrex","message":"hello, world!"}</span>.&lt;<span>inscrutable crytographic soup&gt;</span></pre>

<p>The header tells whoever is verifying the JWT which cryptographic algorithm was used to sign it (“alg”), and optionally an identifier for the key it was signed with (“kid”).</p>

<p>There are a number of problems that JWTs are shoe-horned into being a solution for, and one very common one is for verifying data that is passed between services by an untrusted user. For example, service A produces a token and gives it to a user, who then presents the token to service B. Because the token is round-tripping through the user, it is important to make sure they haven’t altered it (or created it themselves), and the token really was generated by the first service.</p>

<p>In the context of the NHS App, “service A” is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">website that generates QR codes for venues to display</a>, and “Service B” is the NHS COVID-19 app. There are actually multiple untrusted users carrying the QR code from service A to service B: the venue owner who prints out the QR code and sticks it up on the wall, and any customers who scan the QR code with their phone. Because of the cryptographic signature, the app can verify that the QR code it scans really was created by the official website.</p>

<p>That’s the theory.</p>

<p>In security and cryptography circles, JWTs used in this way are practically synonymous with “alg=none” bugs. Remember that “alg” field in the header earlier? One of the options is “none”. This, as you may have guessed already, means no verification occurs. This has proven to be the single biggest footgun in the JWT specification, as despite seemingly being a very obvious trap to avoid, many JWT libraries out there hide these details from users and make it very easy to accidentally allow the “none” algorithm.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that this is <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">hilariously and depressingly common</a>, and well worth double-checking if you are investigating any system that uses JWTs or, heaven help you, building one. That’s why this was my first thought upon learning the NHS app uses JWTs, and why I wanted to check if they made this specific mistake.</p>

<h2 id="lets-take-a-look">Let’s Take A Look</h2>

<p>Both the NHS apps (Android and iOS) <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01157/en-us?parentid=CAT-01028&amp;rootid=CAT-01024">are open source</a>, so it’s very easy for someone like me –&nbsp;more accustomed to reading/writing source code than reverse engineering – to take a look. A quick search for “JWT” in each repo later and we find:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-ios-ag-public/blob/a15cebbda5c073f1e0f7b266105110d0d88a7b27/NHS-COVID-19/Core/Sources/Domain/CheckIn/Model/QRCode.swift">The iOS app</a>:</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(I’ve omitted code not relevant to the signature checking)</p>

<p>This looks fine. Sure, it’s a little bit weird to do the key checking yourself rather than defer to a JWT library for it. But on the other hand, it’s extremely obvious reading this code that it’s doing the right thing, at least as far as alg=none avoidance goes (I cannot vouch for the cryptography, however. I’m just an alg=none expert).</p>

<p>The key part here is that the signing algorithm is hardcoded to P256, so setting alg to “none” in the JWT itself will have no effect on verification. Additionally the key to use is also hardcoded: it’s passed in to the class via the constructor. The “kid” (key id) field in the JWT is <em>checked</em>, but ultimately thrown away. The JWT is not trusted to choose the algorithm or the key, and in that sense this is a great example of how to safely use JWTs, if you do absolutely have to use them.</p>

<p>Lastly, the payload of the JWT is not decoded or used at all until after the signature is verified. This isn’t really relevant to the alg=none issue, but it is good practice in general to only access signed data after verifying that it hasn’t been tampered with. In cryptography, this protects you from <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">clever cryptographic attacks</a>. With JWTs it ensures you don’t accidentally use attacker-provided data for any decisions in your code if the signature fails, and has a side-benefit of creating a layered defence to exploiting the JSON parser (historically a decent source of bugs).</p>

<p>Anyway, this code looks fine. Great! <a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-android-ag-public/blob/2e37797b9b7b5db5b393280a9ef8b93a19af4964/app/src/main/java/uk/nhs/nhsx/covid19/android/app/qrcode/QrCodeParser.kt">On to Android</a> (again, I’ve omitted irrelevant code):</p>

<p>Phew, there’s a lot more going on here! Let’s break it down:</p>

<p>We start in the <code>parse</code> function and after some basic data juggling, we parse the JWT. Then we check if the signature is correct, and if it isn’t, we bail:</p>

<p>It was in the last great recession that I started doing contract software development, about 2008-2010. The bubble didn’t burst with as much force and shrapnel as in 2000, but it had a distinct dampening of the animal spirits of SOMA, San Francisco where all the startups lived. </p>



<p>It was somewhat by design. The previous job I had, writing Java and ActionScript for a marketing research company was chill enough but felt aimless. I had so little motivation I ended up coasting for a few months and playing a lot of pingpong. I wanted some new challenges, so decided to go freelance.</p>



<p>The first gig I got was off of Craigslist, although I imagine these days Upwork would be a better place to look for work. The project was very limited in scope; mostly adding a Google Maps visualization on top of some grant data for a nonprofit. It was a couple weeks of work, a couple grand, and time to move on.</p>



<p>Some time later a former colleague of mine hired me for some development work at a SF startup doing IP telephony combined with podcasting. This was 2009 so nobody had ever heard of podcasts and smartphones were still a fresh new technology people weren’t entirely sure what to do with. The gig was a fun challenge – enabling people to listen to and produce podcasts using only a telephone, no apps involved. I ended up developing some pretty innovative software that resembled a web framework but for touch tone and interactive voice response (IVR) phone applications. We successfully moved the application from an expensive managed solution to our own in-house platform that I designed, significantly cutting down operating costs.</p>



<p>After some time working on that project, I met a couple of guys who wanted to build a SEO-optimized directory of medical professionals, starting with Spanish-speaking plastic surgeons. I said I could cobble together a search engine in my spare time and was engaged. Some days I would walk the two blocks over from the small telephony company office to the small office housing the nascent doctor directory business and show my progress.</p>



<p>It seemed clear at the time that the podcasting telephony company while highly experimental, was professionally run. It had not one but two Stanford business school co-CEOs running it, with what amounted to a successful track record in the form of an early dot-com electronic greeting card company. Remember those? Weird shit. There were respectable investors, a small team of smart and highly competent professionals, and a beautiful office on Howard St. I recall situated on the floor below our office sat a little room consisting of no furniture save a well-stocked bar with never any people in sight, and a sign on the door reading “GitHub.” I felt like great things could happen.</p>



<p>In contrast, my side gig seemed like some small-time SEO hustling along with a smaller team and paycheck and no Stanford business vibes or major VC funding. I didn’t see anything wrong with that, and still tried to do a professional job, but it seemed like more of a dead end compared to the “real” engineering I was doing, fighting battles with touchy open-source PBX software and voice recognition grammars.</p>



<p>Then things turned out completely differently from what I expected. The doctor directory project kept growing, expanding, and taking on a life of its own. We got a proper office at 1st and Mission, hired an engineer, a designer, a salesperson. Plastic surgeons were mostly ditched, and now we were primarily helping American dentists establish a presence on this new “world wide web” technology they couldn’t quite wrap their heads around. This contacting gig that I imagined would consist of a couple months of basic work kept growing and there was always more work to do. Without any planning or expectations it turned into a real company, with eventually a staff of 25 talented and terrific people and an extremely respectable office in the Financial District. We built software to help all kinds of small medical practices in the US manage their patient communication, from appointment reminders to e-visits to actually useful online medical Q&amp;A. Six years later we sold the company to a large practice management software firm in Irvine, CA.</p>

<p>Following that experience my business partner John and I started a new company together again, this time on purpose. We started hiring and training some of the best young engineers, taking on projects and filling outstaffing needs for our clients, staffing a couple offices in Eastern Europe until covid forced us to go purely remote. This has in effect scaled up from my original single-person consulting operation into a powerhouse team of crack young engineers ready to take on complex software projects. </p>



<p>The classic Silicon Valley VC-backed, Stanford-connected, hip startup went nowhere, and closed its doors. I got permission to <a href="https://github.com/revmischa/asteryst">open-source</a> the IVR framework we built but little else came of it. As it happened, consulting across different clients helped me to gain a broader picture of what was actually possible and break my preconceived notions founded on image instead of substance. I accidentally ended up starting a company which went on to help make American health care just a little tiny bit less terrible, created a couple dozen jobs, and had the profound and unique experience of building up the software for a company starting completely from nothing up through due diligence and acquisition. Along the way I learned some lessons about software contracting I want to share with others who may be considering going <em>rōnin</em> and setting out on their own as freelancers.</p>



<h2>Tradeoffs and Considerations</h2>



<p>It’s my nature to think of everything in terms of trade-offs. Maybe because I have engineer-brain, or because I’m a libra, who knows. There are real benefits to consulting as opposed to being a full-time employee, but also some downsides.</p>



<h3>Legal Concerns</h3>



<p>In America at least, contracting means forming your own business, doing 1099 tax forms and racking up deductions, and drafting and reviewing contracts. It’s more effort and responsibility than being a full-time employee somewhere, as you’re now responsible for taxes and legal matters. Even if you’re not in America, being able to work across borders means creating a legal business entity.</p>



<p>I started by initially getting a DBA, or “Doing Business As” name, under which I could legally create contracts and other paperwork using an official-looking business name. Later on I “upgraded” to a California S-Corporation, which gives favorable tax treatment once your income reaches a certain threshold along with some legal liability protection. If your corporation is sued, all that can be collected usually is what the corporation has, shielding you personally to some degree. A Cali S-Corp will run you $800 a year not counting the time spent on paperwork and taxes you or your accountant/tax attorney will be doing.</p>



<p>Even getting a DBA or Fictitious Business Name is far from simple. In Contra Costa County for example:</p>



<blockquote><p>Within 30 days after a fictitious business name statement has been filed, the registrant shall cause it to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the fictitious business name statement was filed or, if there is no such newspaper in that county, in a newspaper of general circulation in an adjoining county. If the registrant does not have a place of business in this state, the notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in Sacramento County. The publication must be once a week for four successive weeks and an affidavit of publication must be filed with the county clerk where the fictitious business name statement was filed within 30 days after the completion of the publication.</p><cite><a href="https://www.ccclerkrec.us/clerk/clerk/fictitious-business-name/">https://www.ccclerkrec.us/clerk/clerk/fictitious-business-name/</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>You don’t need to do this yourself necessarily, services like <a href="https://www.businessrocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BusinessRocket</a> can take care of business formation and taxes for a small fee.</p>



<p>One of the first things you’ll need to do is ask your friends for legal services recommendations. If you know anyone who is a contractor or a small business owner they probably have lawyers they work with and can recommend. Or you can hit me up. I enlisted the services of a business attorney to help me draft and review contracts, and a <a href="https://taxninja.com/">tax attorney</a> to take care of the corporation taxes and paperwork. Obviously lawyers are not cheap and in theory you can do all of this yourself, but they can also save you a great time of time and money as well by warning you about common pitfalls and fuckups, and suggest ways to better protect yourself or take advantage of favorable tax laws.</p>



<p>When you are going to agree to do work for a client they will want to know your hourly or project rate and a contract to sign. Understand that around a third to a half of your hourly rate is going to go to taxes, so adjust accordingly. A contract will need to have some important pieces of information. I highly suggest not listening to me and listening to an Actual Lawyer in your country or state about drafting a contract, but as far as software development you will typically need to include a “schedule of work.” This is the scope of what you will be expected to deliver in order to get paid.</p>



<p>Come at the schedule of work with a PM mindset – you have to figure out what the client actually wants and what actually needs to get built. If you end up needing to do more work outside of this scope then it can be a headache, and having a contract which spells out what you’ve been asked to do can make an effective backstop against scope creep. As a related matter, I highly suggest doing per-hour billing rather than doing projects for a fixed price whenever possible, because as we all know the best laid o’ work statement<em> </em>often go awry.</p>

<div id="content">
<h2>About</h2>
<p><b>Code Browser</b> is a folding text editor for Linux and Windows, 
designed to hierarchically structure any kind of text file and especially source 
code. It makes navigation through source code faster and easier.

</p><center><img src="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/images/code-browser.png"></center>

<p>Code Browser is especially designed to keep a good overview of the code of 
large projects, but is also useful for a simple CSS file. 
Ideal if you are fed up of having to scroll through thousands of lines of code.

</p><p>See the <a href="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/code-folding.html">Introduction to Code Folding</a> page if you
want more information on text folding and the way it is implemented in Code Browser.

</p><p>It supports syntax highlighting for all major languages and custom syntax 
highlighting can also be added.

</p><p>Although Code Browser was initially designed to edit programs, it can 
also be used for different tasks such as plain text outlining or helping to understand
existing source code. I've added a page with suggestions to
<a href="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/tips.html">take advantage of folding</a>.

      Talking, Typing, Thinking: Software Is Not a Desk Job

      <summary>
        <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Developers over-optimise for the ergonomics of typing and not enough for the ergonomics of thinking.</p>
      </summary>

    <p>I had a wonderful shower the other day.</p>

<p>It was late morning (as the best showers often are) and I was reflecting on how I spend my time during the day. As a work-from-home consultant, I constantly need to justify my billing and my time, and in this case I was justifying spending more of it in the shower.</p>

<p>Like most of us, I started my career with the impression that a productive day was spent ergonomically poised over a keyboard typing hundreds of lines of code into Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Edition, and <em>not</em> standing in a perfectly hot stream of high pressure fresh water. However, the longer I spend as a developer, the less I’m convinced I need to be at my desk to deliver the truly astounding spreadsheet-to-web-application business value us senior engineering consultants deliver.</p>

<p>So that you too can justify spending the good part of a morning enveloped in a cocoon of cleansing warmth, let’s break this down and look at 5 physical activities of effective software development. Like all good listicles, this is ordered roughly in order of increasing time and importance.</p>

<h2 id="talking">5. Talking</h2>

<p>Some software development probably doesn’t need any talking to be effective. I understand for example that it is universally considered bad manners to talk about linux kernel development out loud. The contents of ~/bin too, we do not speak of.</p>

<p>But every commercial project I’ve worked on has needed at least some talking. When people are too busy or just too shy to talk, the lack of high-bandwidth communication can make it hard to tease out requirements and unpack poorly explained business problems.</p>

<p>But more importantly, a lack of talking makes it hard to build trust and rapport — critical&nbsp;in early stages of any new relationship. As social animals, we are particularly good at doing this verbally, and not particularly good at doing this with emails and spicy subtweets.</p>

<p>On the other hand I’ve worked on projects where talking is a prop to disguise that no-one knows what to do. Where a dozen people sit in a room and talk for an hour without saying anything and we all walk out dumber than when we walked in.</p>

<p>So for most cases: talking is critical, but in the right amount.</p>

<h2 id="listening">4. Listening</h2>

<p>Honestly I just included this for symmetry. The only thing I’ll add is that we have two ears and one mouth so either binaural hearing offers an evolutionary advantage against some selection pressure or we’re supposed to listen twice as much as we talk.</p>

<p>Take your pithy wisdom however you like it.</p>

<p><em>(quickly googles why do we have two ears)</em></p>

<h2 id="writing">3. Writing</h2>

<p>Writing code of course! But also… READMEs, comments, inline documentation, PR descriptions, code reviews, git commits; this is all part of the <em>core work</em>. It’s tempting to see this meta-writing as overhead on top of the real ‘code’ writing. But effective writing in these other places is a force multiplier for your code.</p>

<p>Much more importantly though, in my experience the best communication is written.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s async, meaning it can be consumed whenever convenient for each reader (i.e. after a late morning shower).</li>
  <li>It can be easily distributed and has no fidelity loss when shared (compared to talking to John about what Sarah told you Steve said in meeting that none of you were at).</li>
  <li>It creates a record, as opposed to “wait, why did we…?”</li>
  <li><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/writing-is-thinking/">Writing is thinking</a>! Writing forces you to structure your ideas coherently (at least, it seems to for some people). It reveals shortcomings or gaps in your understanding or plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of this I encourage team comms to be mostly written. Jira, slack, emails, trello, blog posts, whatever. Even a hi-res photo of a wall of post-it notes has been an indispensable architectural road-map at times. However it’s published, detailed, well-thought out writing is 💯.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more important than writing though is…</p>

<h2 id="reading">2. Reading</h2>

<p>Having just extolled the virtues of writing READMEs, commit messages, PR descriptions, etc, I should obviously encourage you to read them. It’s called README IN CAPITALS for a reason, and it’s not just because it’s an acronym. Yet if I had a dollar for every time someone asked me a question that was already answered in the README I would have three dollars. 💰</p>

<p>This is because of what I succinctly call the vicious-reading-writing-cycle-feedback-loop. When people don’t update the commentary, people become trained to ignore it, so people don’t update it, etc. Truthfully, if you know someone’s reading your git commits, their quality will rapidly improve. Even if you’ve never read a coherent git commit from your colleagues before, it’s never too late to ask them to elaborate on what <code>finally fix it</code> means.</p>

<p>But like writing, the value of reading extends well beyond the code repository.</p>

<p>I recently started a project involving a completely unfamiliar field of medical technology (ps you’re <a href="https://twitter.com/danielfone/status/1318026784454045703">still my favourite</a> patient <code>01-004</code> 📊❤️). The most valuable activity I find at this stage of a project is to read.</p>

<p>We have to parse a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Data_Format">specialised file format</a>, for which there is <a href="https://github.com/nsrr/edfize">a gem</a>. But why leave all that useful context buried inside the gem? The <a href="https://www.edfplus.info/specs/edf.html">file specification</a> is not that long, even if it takes many attempts to understand it. Reading the file format spec makes it much easier to understand why the gem needs to <a href="https://github.com/nsrr/edfize/blob/93566cdc82b160ef319c51908c1c4a19666e2625/lib/edfize/edf.rb#L243">load_digital_signals_by_epoch</a>, which in turn suggests alternative solutions to the problem you have in hand.</p>

<p>None of the <em>adjacent possible</em><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is discoverable without the insights gained from reading these sources, so whatever you’re dealing with, go to the source and read read read…</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentation (<em>reading the very well-written <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html">postgres manual</a> or <a href="https://redis.io/documentation">redis docs</a> is the closet experience I’ve had to Neo downloading kung-fu into his brain</em>)</li>
  <li>code (<em>vastly underrated - there’s not a gem in my Gemfiles I haven’t <code>bundle open</code>d at least once</em>)</li>
  <li>log files, error messages, that tutorial on how to read flame graphs</li>
  <li>the specification, legislation, policy document, NIST guideline, the original paper in the open access journal</li>
</ul>

<p>… you get the idea, just find the authoritative document and slurp it into your brain. Even if it seems like nothing sticks, a brief encounter with the text will leave a long-lasting impression. It’s like homeopathy but real.</p>

<p>So talking/listening… writing/reading… and finally… <em>drumroll noises</em></p>

<h2 id="thinking">1. Thinking</h2>

<p>When you boil it down, <em>this</em> is the main effort for me, and yet it’s kind of the hidden one.</p>

<p>How much of my programming/coding/dev time is actually just spent <em>thinking</em> about the problems?
Modelling the domain,
thinking through the edge cases,
mentally playing with abstractions.</p>

<p>And it’s obvious when you think about what makes good developers. The people I value working with most aren’t accurate typists, they’re <em>clear thinkists</em>.</p>

<p>Yet the image persists that typing is working and working is typing and a productive day is in your chair at your desk.
So we have dual 4k monitors, mechanical keyboards, aeron chairs, touchbar, vim shortcuts, whatever optimises for us tapping away at our computers.</p>

<p>But how much attention do we pay to the <strong>ergonomics of thinking</strong>?</p>

<p>When we elevate ‘thinking’ to core work, we naturally start to optimise for it specifically. In general, we don’t need to be in front of anything to think effectively, and often I find it better not to be. My times of greatest clarity are invariably when I’m moving, often when I’m exercising. Further, I can read on my phone practically anywhere, and the best conversations are often had while strolling.</p>

<p>So while I’m glad for all the ergonomics of my workspace, increasingly I find that writing code is the brief part where I’m simply harvesting all the mental crop that I’ve sown from the talking and listening and reading and thinking.</p>

<p>To distill this into something a little more alliterative, I have sometimes described this as the 3 Ts of software development…</p>

<h2>Talking · Typing · Thinking</h2>

<p><strong>Talking</strong> and listening; the verbal discussions. Most of the time we need a small but critical amount of high bandwidth synchronous comms.</p>

<p><strong>Typing</strong> code commentary: READMEs, code reviews, PR descriptions; and all asynchronous communication: project updates, technical overviews, emails with next steps; These are all an essential part of the job and not just ancillary or busywork. Also typing actual code at some point. But I find the more time you spend typing the other stuff, the less time you need to spend (re)typing code.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong>: (including, for the purposes of alliteration, reading)</p>

<p>Talking, typing, thinking: this is the work we do. And I for one want to give myself the space to do all parts of it really well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I gotta go take a shower. 🚿</p>

Let’s get this show on the road, yes?</em></p><p>When Brian moved to SF and decided to live with Joe to figure out what their billion-dollar startup was gonna be, he quickly learned that in order to make rent in SF, you have to sell a kidney. Probably both if you’re one of those fancy, pampered types that enjoys the finer things in life such as, you know, nutrition.</p><p>He didn’t have his part of the rent though ($1150).</p><p>But that weekend, there just so happened to be <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2016/sxsw-eco-award-winners-and-conference-highlights/" target="_blank">an international design conference at SXSW</a>, and they noticed that all the hotels on the website were listed fully booked.</p><p>They figured: well, designers are gonna have to stay somewhere, we don’t have the money to make rent, so what if we made a makeshift Bed and Breakfast?</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_29128"><div><p>But Brian and Joe didn’t have any beds. However, Joe had some airbeds leftover from camping so they changed their idea to an Airbed and Breakfast (Airbnb).</p><p>They ended up hosting a 35yr old woman from Boston, a 45yr old father of 5 from Utah, and a <a href="https://nextshark.com/meet-man-became-airbnbs-first-guest/" target="_blank">30yr old man from India</a>. Oh… and they made rent.</p><p><em>If you just want to read about Airbnb, skip the following section and pick back up at: BUILD SOMETHING SMALL THAT YOU WANT AND THINK IS DOPE.</em></p><p><strong>Notice that they weren’t trying to build a unicorn</strong>. They just needed to make rent and it seemed like a cool, fun thing to try.</p><p>This is a surprisingly common theme in startups. Travis made a similar remark about the origins of Uber:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>‘’When we first started it wasn’t about taking over the world. It wasn’t about taking on corruption in every city around the world. It was actually just about being baller in San Francisco.’’</p></blockquote><p><em>Because literally every POS article on Business Insider type websites doesn’t have the accurate quote and more annoyingly can’t be bothered with a source either, here it is:</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603187267518_32526"><div><p><em>Travis Kalanick at Startup School 2012 (2 years after founding Uber).</em></p><p>Back when computers were expensive, Woz built his own because he wanted one for himself. That was the origin of Woz, Jobs, and for 12 days Wayne’s, Apple.</p><blockquote><p>‘’I had no idea that I was taking exactly the right steps up this nice smooth ladder that leads up to the Apple II.’’</p></blockquote><p>Notice the nice smooth ladder he’s talking about. You start small and incrementally work your way up.

	<p>Mobile phone reception</p>


	


	<p>Uninterrupted, good quality mobile phone reception is extremely important to rail passengers. In technical terms, it’s the pièce de résistance for every network provider because the demands on bandwidth increase with data-intensive applications. Swisscom has now successfully achieved a transmission speed of over 1 Gigabit per second on a moving train under test conditions. This result sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry.</p>

				<p>How do most people use their phones when on a train? Besides checking their mail and reading the paper, they also stream videos, play online games or work in virtual offices. This requires a great deal of bandwidth, meaning that capacity issues can prove particularly annoying. A Swisscom team has been researching and working on continuously improving mobile coverage for rail travellers and commuters for more than ten years.</p>

<p>The invention of a special type of glass for the train windows, which lets mobile telephone signals through, has made it possible to bring mobile coverage directly onto the train without intermediate components. However, coverage along train routes remains challenging as much more data is transmitted under the same conditions with each mobile phone generation. One possible solution is a specially designed antenna corridor along railway lines.</p>

				<p>Swisscom has now made a major breakthrough on a test route between Biberlikopf and Kerenzerberg at Lake Walen with a newly designed four-kilometre antenna corridor: Swisscom engineers achieved a connection with 1.2 Gbit/s on a moving train. Christoph Aeschlimann, Head of IT, Network &amp; Infrastructure at Swisscom says: “This concept sets a new benchmark for the mobile phone industry. Just one year ago, we had no idea whether this would be possible. We now have a solution that provides stable and reliable coverage for passengers as well as important insights for safety-relevant applications in rail transport.”</p>
<p>Another positive side effect is the lower transmitting power required due to the shorter distances between antennas and devices.</p>

		<p>After evaluating the results, the test corridor will be further optimised and validated with measurements in the first quarter of 2021. The long-term goal is to achieve uninterrupted mobile phone coverage along the main routes for all mobile phone users and providers in Switzerland In terms of the antenna corridor, Swisscom has developed a feasible solution that is also available to other providers.</p>

				<p>A four-kilometre antenna corridor was constructed along the railway line at Lake Walen for the test, in conjunction with network equipment supplier Ericsson. The proximity of the antenna to devices means the transmitting power is lower and the coverage along the railway corridor is more targeted.</p>

<p>In a step-by-step procedure, numerous combinations (4G and 5G mobile phone generations, seating position, type of train car, transmitting power, train windows, mast antennas, smartphone models, etc.) were measured and analysed over more than 200 train journeys. The project has shown that the antenna corridor is possible and offers good performance. Download speeds of over 1.2 Gbit/s were possible on a moving train with a combination of 4G and 5G. The 5G response time was four times shorter than 4G – an impressive 8 milliseconds.</p>

<p>In addition to network coverage, safety-critical applications on rail transport are another consideration. The existing GSM-R railway communication network standard will be replaced in the coming years by the new Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS). Good mobile phone coverage is also therefore crucial for rail companies as well as passengers.</p>

<div><p>An interesting question came up on Stack Overflow recently that I suggested a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/64338987/504554">hypothetical answer</a> for how to do hostname based proxying for MQTT.</p><p>In this post I’ll explore how to actually implement that hypothetical solution.</p></div>



<h2>History</h2>



<p>HTTP added the ability to do hostname based proxying when it instroduced the <code>Host</code> header in HTTP v1.1. This meant that a single IP address could be used for many sites and the server would decide which content to serve based on the his header. Front end reverse proxies (e.g. nginx) can use the same header to decide which backend server to forward the traffic to.</p>



<p>This works well until we need encrypt the traffic to the HTTP server using SSL/TLS where the headers are encrypted. The solution to this is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI</a> header in the TLS handshake, this tells the server which hostname the client is trying to connect to. The front end proxy can then either use this information to find the right local copy of the certificate/key for that site if it’s terminating the encryption at the frontend or it can forward the whole connection directly to the correct backend server. </p>



<h2>MQTT</h2>



<p>Since the SNI header is in the initial TLS handshake and is nothing to do with the underlying protocol it can be used for ay protocol, in this case MQTT. This measn if we set up a frontend proxy that uses SNI to pick the correct backend server to connect to.</p>



<p>Here is a nginx configuration file that proxies for 2 different MQTT brokers based on the hostname the client uses to connect. It is doing the TLS termination at the proxy before forwarding the clear version to the backend.</p>


<pre title="">user  nginx;
worker_processes  auto;

error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid        /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}

stream {  
  map $ssl_server_name $targetBackend {
    test1.example.com  192.168.1.1:1883;
    test2.example.com  192.168.1.2:1883;
  }

  map $ssl_server_name $targetCert {
    test1.example.com /certs/test1-chain.crt;
    test2.example.com /certs/test2-chain.crt;
  }

  map $ssl_server_name $targetCertKey {
    test1.example.com /certs/test1.key;
    test2.example.com /certs/test2.key;
  }
  
  server {
    listen 1883         ssl; 
    ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2;
    ssl_certificate     $targetCert;
    ssl_certificate_key $targetCertKey;
        
    proxy_connect_timeout 1s;
    proxy_pass $targetBackend;
  } 
}
</pre>


<p>Assuming the the DNS entries for <code>test1.example.com</code> and <code>test2.example.com</code> both point to the host running nginx then we can test this with the <code>mosquitto_sub</code> command as follows</p>


<pre title="">$ mosquitto_sub -v -h test1.example.com -t test --cafile ./ca-certs.pem
</pre>


<p>This will be proxied to the broker running on <code>192.168.1.1</code>, where as </p>


<pre title="">$ mosquitto_sub -v -h test2.example.com -t test --cafile ./ca-certs.pem
</pre>


<p>will be proxied to the broker on <code>192.168.1.2.</code></p>



<h2>Cavets</h2>



<p>The main drawback with this approach is that it requires that all the clients connect using TLS, but this is not a huge problem as nearly all devices are capable of this now and for any internet facing service it should be the default anyway.</p>



<h2>Acknowledgment</h2>



<p>How to do this was mainly informed by the following <a href="https://gist.github.com/kekru/c09dbab5e78bf76402966b13fa72b9d2">Gist</a></p>

						<p>Science has two stark problems: replication and innovation. Many scientific findings aren’t reproducible. That is to say, you can’t be sure that another study or experiment on the same question would get similar results. At the same time, the pace of scientific innovation could be slowing down.</p>
<p>Does attempting to solve one problem make the other worse? Many have argued that policies seeking to avoid reproducibility issues will create a constrictive atmosphere that inhibits innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Indeed, top policymakers are worried about just this. Along with other prominent philanthropists and academics, I attended a White House meeting on scientific reproducibility early in 2020 (just before COVID-19 really hit). One of the key questions on a sheet of paper that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy circulated for discussion was whether a tradeoff existed: Would efforts to improve reproducibility risk harming the creativity and innovation of federally-funded research?</p>
<p>I do <i>not</i> think there’s a contradiction between reproducibility and innovation. Contrary to common belief, we can improve <i>both</i> at once – by incentivizing failed results, and by funding “Red Teams” that would aim to refute existing dogma or would be entirely outside it.</p>
<p>First, though, let’s take a step back, and briefly review the evidence that significant areas of science could be more reproducible and innovative.</p>
<h2><b>Is science reproducible?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>Many people have written about scientific irreproducibility over the past several decades. But the issue became more prominent in the mid-2000s with the publication of what soon became one of the most downloaded research papers of all time: The 2005 piece “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a>,” by Stanford’s John Ioannidis. (Disclaimer: he is a long-time grantee of Arnold Ventures, where I work.)</p>
<p>To be sure, Ioannidis’s finding was mostly theoretical; it’s not as if he actually redid “most” published research (i.e., tens of millions of studies). Instead, he showed that given the way most studies are carried out, if journals have even a slight bias towards positive results (and they most definitely do), then most of the results that end up getting published would inevitably be statistical flukes or the results of p-hacking.</p>
<p>His theoretical case has been confirmed by many empirical studies in fields from drug development to psychology. Pharmaceutical companies such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> have reported that they are unable to reproduce 80+% of experiments from prestigious journals. To quote Bayer’s scientists, “projects that were started in our company based on exciting published data have often resulted in disillusionment when key data could not be reproduced.”</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://osf.io/ezcuj/">Reproducibility Project in Psychology</a>, which we funded, and which was carried out by our grantee Center for Open Science. That project organized well over 200 psychology labs around the world to systematically redo 100 experiments published in top psychology journals. It found that only about 40% could be reliably replicated (another 40% were inconclusive, and around 20% were decisively <i>not</i> replicated). Since <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716">those results were published</a> in 2015, the study has already been cited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10200793109432081889&amp;as_sdt=5,44&amp;sciodt=0,44&amp;hl=en">over 4,400 times</a> according to Google Scholar. Many of the most famous results in psychology have turned out to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment">unreliable</a> and possibly fraudulent (such as Zimbardo’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication">Stanford prison experiment</a>), and the best recent treatment of this issue is Stuart Ritchie’s 2020 book “Science Fictions.”</p>
<p>To be sure, the problem seems much less acute in harder sciences – e.g., physics, chemistry, cosmology – that have an established tradition of skepticism, replication, or even <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper-MacCounPerlmutter2017ch15.pdf">blinding researchers</a> to their own conclusions. The bulk of the reproducibility and publication bias problem seems to be in social science and biomedicine. In many of those fields and subfields – such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19160345/">clinical trials in medicine</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1092.pdf">high-throughput bioinformatics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000090">neuroimaging</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661314000540">cognitive science</a>, <a href="https://www.niss.org/publications/deming-data-and-observational-studies-process-out-control-and-needing-fixing">public health and epidemiological research</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joes.12032">economics</a>, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-fault-in-our-stars-%3A-Measuring-and-correcting-Esarey-Wu/48403d5dce1f2972c7a91af3bb2d41635221cb3f">political science</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23696308/">psychiatry</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1019294">education</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124108318973">sociology</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Examining-Reproducibility/">computer science</a>, and <a href="https://dennybritz.com/blog/ai-replication-incentives/">machine learning and AI</a> – the published literature features too many false positives as well as conclusions that may well be p-hacked. It’s enough to make folks at the White House, NIH, and NSF worried about the quality of federally-funded science.</p>
<h2><b>Is science innovative enough?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>At the same time, numerous observers have pointed to an entirely different problem: science has grown less innovative these days. (And even if it hasn’t, we could always benefit from faster innovation.)</p>
<p>In a recent piece, Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, and Michael Nielsen, a theoretical physicist, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">made the case</a> that the rate of scientific advancement is slowing down in recent years per dollar spent. Based on surveys of noted leaders in physics, chemistry, and medicine, they concluded, “Over the past century, we’ve vastly increased the time and money invested in science, but in scientists’ own judgement, we’re producing the most important breakthroughs at a near-constant rate. On a per-dollar or per-person basis, this suggests that science is becoming far less efficient.”</p>
<p>Collison and Nielsen are <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26752.pdf">far from alone</a>. Cowen and Southwood <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/sites/brown.edu.academics.political-theory-project/files/uploads/Innovation%20%26%20scientific%20progress.pdf">argue</a> that “there is good and also wide-ranging evidence that the rate of scientific progress has indeed slowed down.” The 2019 <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">paper</a>, “Are Good Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” argues that in semiconductors, agriculture, and medical innovations, “research effort is rising substantially while research productivity is declining sharply.”	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>They attempted to replicate this analysis for “the internal combustion engine, the speed of air travel, the efficiency of solar panels, the Nordhaus (1997) ‘price of light’ evidence, and the sequencing of the human genome.” But they couldn’t do so because there was no accurate measure of the amount of R&amp;D on those issues.</span>
	 That paper concludes by predicting that “just to sustain constant growth in GDP per person, the U.S. must double the amount of research effort searching for new ideas every 13 years to offset the increased difficulty of finding new ideas.”</p>
<p>Of course, some of these assessments might be too <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">pessimistic</a>. But it is depressingly common to hear the world’s most innovative scientists lament that they would never have succeeded in today’s academic or funding system because their work was too outside the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roger Kornberg (a Nobel-winning biochemist) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700794.html">told the Washington Post in 2007</a> that his 1970s research on DNA “would never have gotten the necessary funding” if he had come along in the 2000s: “In the present climate especially, the funding decisions are ultraconservative. If the work that you propose to do isn’t virtually certain of success, then it won’t be funded.”</li>
<li>As <a href="https://www.kqed.org/forum/201310090930/cuts-in-federal-funding-hurt-scientific-research">reported</a> in 2013, “UC Berkeley molecular biologist Randy Schekman won the Nobel Prize for Medicine with two other scientists this week. But he says the kind of basic science research that led to his prize might have never gotten funded if he were applying for grants today.”</li>
<li>David Deutsch, who pioneered quantum computing, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/982233180081029128">says</a> that he would never have gotten his “first research grant on quantum computers . . . under today’s criteria.”</li>
<li>Peter Higgs, the Nobel Laureate for whom the Higgs Boson is named, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system">believes</a> no university would employ him in today’s academic system because he would not be considered ‘productive’ enough. . . . ‘Today I wouldn’t get an academic job. It’s as simple as that. I don’t think I would be regarded as productive enough.’”</li>
</ul>
<p>When so many top scientists say that their own work would never have passed muster in the current system, we must take stock of the current system. As prominent scientists <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6441/613">have asked</a>, “How successful would Silicon Valley be if nearly 99% of all investments were awarded to scientists and engineers aged 36 years or older, along with a strong bias toward funding only safe, non-risky projects?” Moreover, a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/06/07/science-holds-key-unlocking-economic-success/">common complaint</a> is that “scientists are forced to specify years in advance what they intend to do, and spend their time continually applying for very short, small grants” – hardly a system that would encourage innovation.</p>
<p>In short, we have evidence that US science funding is often fairly tame and incremental, that some of the most innovative science of the past would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/19/723326933/billion-dollar-gamble-how-a-singular-hero-helped-start-a-new-field-in-physics?fbclid=IwAR28fazRNhzzT5ijMINwzZkNqlP6fEfBlI4OLyY-eesrUyOfbZfF7-P4qUc">never have been funded</a> by today’s bureaucracy, and that scientific review panels are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/492034a">dominated by insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, innovation in science is imperiled. If Einstein had to navigate such a system, we might <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-einstein-get-published-today-11600974323">never have heard of relativity</a>. And even if innovation weren’t slowing down <em>per se</em>, we could still do better.</p>
<h2><b>What next?</b></h2>
<p>There are lots of ideas about how to improve scientific reproducibility in how federal research is funded. After all, quality control and assurance are hardly new ideas.</p>
<p>For example, we could require that data and computer code be shared openly so that others can scrutinize and rerun it. In too many cases to list, this sort of reanalysis has led to revisions, retractions, and even the discovery of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-a-gay-marriage-study-went-wrong">outright fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we could require that experiments and other empirical studies be pre-registered, so that the analysis and results are less likely to be cherry-picked later. We already do this for clinical trials in medicine, and a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382">review</a> of federally-sponsored clinical trials found that the rate of positive results went down dramatically as soon as researchers were required to pre-register their studies. We could do the same for much else in science. We could even move towards more widespread use of the Registered Reports format, in which journals accept an article for publication before the final results are even available.</p>
<p>It’s less obvious how to reform government funding so as to improve scientific <i>innovation</i>. Let’s try a thought experiment:</p>
<p>Imagine that you were the President 100 years ago, instead of Woodrow Wilson. Imagine that a time-traveling genie from the future tells you that over the …</p></div></div></div>

<h6 id="3-min-read"><em>3 min read</em></h6>
<p>“Go build something,” said the panelist who was clearly more experienced than me.</p>
<p>Boom. These words cut right to me at Nashville’s annual 36-86 Entrepreneur Conference in August 2018. <strong>One month out of the Navy and I had already jumped out of a plane with a bedsheet for a parachute.</strong> My bedsheet was “CrowdCrunch” - clearly a Billion Dollar company even though it hadn’t made a dime. Great name, great website, grand vision, and absolutely no basis in reality.</p>
<p><img src="https://uffizzi.com/images/no-parachute-cropped2.png" alt=""></p>
<h6 id="i-didnt-know-it-at-the-time-but-i-was-deep-into-entrepreneuring"><strong>I didn’t know it at the time, but I was deep into “entrepreneuring”.</strong></h6>
<p>“Entrepreneuring” is the stage most people who attempt their own business start in and, for many, never get beyond. Twenty some odd years ago I remember my dad telling me that 19 out of 20 businesses fail and here in 2020 that still seems to be a good round number - <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/">about 90% of startups fail</a>.</p>
<p>With all the sexy buzz around accelerators, venture capital, angel investors, and building that network there’s a lot of people out there “entrepreneuring”. And why not? Who doesn’t want to be the next Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, or the Zuck himself? Oh and there’s also that “Founder and CEO” title you can immediately put on your business cards.</p>
<h6 id="bonus-points-for-the-ego"><strong>Bonus points for the ego.</strong></h6>
<p>First I’ll define “entrepreneuring” and then it won’t take long to realize why it will get you nowhere over the length of time you spend doing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entrepreneuring">Entrepreneuring</a> according to Dictionary.com is a verb meaning “to deal with or initiate as an entrepreneur” or “to act as an entrepreneur.” Fair enough.</p>
<p>“Entrepreneuring,” however, is something entirely different.</p>
<p>“Entrepreneuring” is doing anything and everything but building something. It’s an endless treadmill that sucks most into a cycle of busyness that leads absolutely nowhere.</p>
<h6 id="entrepreneuring-is-about-hoping-the-magic-of-the-entrepreneurial-spirit-somehow-rubs-off-on-you-and-every-door-in-your-future-suddenly-opens-up-based-on-your-enthusiasm-alone"><strong>“Entrepreneuring” is about hoping the magic of the entrepreneurial spirit somehow rubs off on you and every door in your future suddenly opens up based on your enthusiasm alone.</strong></h6>
<p>“Entrepreneuring” is about attending lots of conferences, meetups, or any other similar gatherings and hoping to bump into that one person or thing (or probably several people or things) you are missing to make your idea a huge success - if only I knew . . .</p>
<p>It is listening to those who profit off the “entrepreneuring” eco-system spread false enthusiasm about a very loosely associated “Un-valley” start-up movement - as if building a business were a collective effort - which, I can assure you, it decidedly is not.</p>
<h6 id="if-youre-unsure-whether-youre-stuck-entrepreneuring-or-if-youve-moved-to-the-critical-step-of-building-something-its-easier-to-take-notice-of-what-is-not-around"><strong>If you're unsure whether you're stuck “entrepreneuring” or if you've moved to the critical step of “building something” it's easier to take notice of what is not around.</strong></h6>
<p>Specifically, you’re unlikely to see any successful entrepreneurs out “entrepreneuring”. That’s because the people in this category are either 1.) building something that will make them successful or 2.) continuing to build upon that which has already made them successful.</p>
<p>Real entrepreneurs are builders by nature - they build and they test and they fall short and they get back up and above all they keep making everything around them better. All this building requires a lot of time and energy which is exactly why you’re unlikely to see any of these folks out “entrepreneuring.”</p>
<h6 id="to-be-fair-entrepreneuring-is-not-all-bad"><strong>To be fair,</strong> <strong>“entrepreneuring” is not all bad.</strong></h6>
<p>There’s plenty to be learned. You can get nuggets of advice from folks who have been there - I definitely did. You can see what’s not working out for people. You can have your hopes dashed when you learn that VCs don’t actually hand out money for ideas.</p>
<h6 id="but-theres-no-lesson-as-important-as-learning-that-you-need-to-get-out-of-this-phase-as-fast-as-possible"><strong>But there’s no lesson as important as learning that you need to get out of this phase as fast as possible</strong>.</h6>
<p>It sunk in for me at a We Work “entrepreneuring” event where I had struck up a conversation with my table mate. After I had explained the grand vision of CrowdCrunch it was his turn to pitch his business. That’s when I had the distinct privilege of hearing about “an app that uses AI to filter out dick pics”.</p>
<h6 id="now-that-is-one-i-have-not-heard"><strong>Now that is one I have not heard.</strong></h6>
<p><img src="https://uffizzi.com/images/seth-meyers-really-ok.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Are there so many dick Pics flying around that we need an app to filter them out? I’ve seen a lot of flying cocks scribbled on dirty cars in my day, but I was struggling to grasp how this was a problem that needed to be solved. Perhaps the best part of this conversation is when he offered up that the hardest part about building an AI model to filter out dick pics is that, well, man, you have to see a lot of dicks. But I digress.</p>
<h6 id="i-was-entirely-in-the-wrong-place--the-wrong-phase--i-was-out-entrepreneuring-with-mr-dick-pics-himself"><strong>I was entirely in the wrong place - the wrong phase - I was out “entrepreneuring” with Mr. Dick Pics himself.</strong></h6>
<p>So I moved on. I quit attending events with other aspiring entrepreneurs. I turned down meetings with VCs and even turned down an invite to a well-respected veteran pitch contest. I put my head down and I started to build - <strong><em>WE</em></strong> started to build. Thank you Mr. 36-86 panelist - it can’t be said better.</p>
<h6 id="go-build-something1"><strong>Go. Build. Something.</strong></h6>

									<ul>
<li><span>Li Jin coined the term, the Passion Economy.</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Li’s definition of the Passion Economy: “The economy in which people are able to convert what they love to do into their source of income.”&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>“It’s an intrinsic human desire to find meaning/purpose in one’s work, not just to earn money from it.” — Li</span></li>
<li><span>Are you able to see yourself in your own work? If not, you’re probably not a part of the passion economy. However, it’s not mutually exclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>The creator economy (content creators) is a subset of the passion economy.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>“The new SMB (small/midsize business) is just a single individual who is leveraging all these software platforms/tech tools in order to run their own business.”&nbsp; — Li</span></li>
<li><span>New tools+platforms are emerging to make these tools accessible to people, such as:&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Vertical platforms that help people create a certain product or service that’s aligned to a specific vertical (i.e. newsletter, podcast, course, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span>Horizontal platforms that people across different platforms can leverage (financial tools, community cultivation software, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>“It’s going to be more common for these solopreneurs that still want a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, but they aren’t employed at a common employer.” — Li</span></li>
<li><span>Li defines community: “A group of people that have really strong bonds with each other, not just with the creator (who’s leading the community), but with each other. People have a mutual concern and interest for one another.”&nbsp; — Li</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Li on what real community leaders need to ask themselves: </span><i><span>What’s the value that people are trying to seek from this place? How are they relating to each other? How can people benefit from each other? How do you deepen the care that people feel for each other?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Li didn’t call it her north star, but she mentions that she’s more interested in the long-tail of how we empower anyone in the country to make an income doing what they love to do. She wants to push forward a world in which people are building technology that helps broaden access to income, customers and to give people new ways of working that feel more meaningful and fulfilling to them.&nbsp;</span></li>

            <p>I am a Computer Science Teaching Fellow at Tufts. Every so often, somebody
comes up to me and expresses some form of the same kind of anxiety,
frustration, worry — whatever you want to call it — centered around one
thing: <em>“Oh gosh. Everyone here knows more than me and they understand things
so quickly and they solve problems so fast.”</em></p>

<p>First, I want to address the comparison to other people. Don’t do that! You are
a different human, a different mass of cells and meat and fluids, with a
different background, a different history, and a different brain.</p>

<p>Second, I want to address the notion that everyone knows more than you. Other
people will be better than you at something. You will be better than other
people at something else. This is normal. This is expected. We all go to school
to learn and become better. Learning to become okay with this feels like a
superpower. I am still working at it.</p>

<p>Third, I want to tell my story.</p>

<h3 id="i-am-not-special">I am not special.</h3>

<p>I am the product of many happy coincidences. I wrote my first line of code when
I was around the age of nine. For some reason, people attribute a lot of
meaning to that, but my interest in programming all comes down to weirdly
specific and lucky combination of factors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I did not play videogames, but somehow I wanted to make them</li>
  <li>I had the wherewithal to ask my fourth grade teacher how to make videogames</li>
  <li>He had enough patience to go home and poke around on the internet for a bit
and recommend Scratch</li>
  <li>My dad bought an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child">OLPC</a></li>
  <li>The OLPC had a small Python-esque interpreter called <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Pippy">Pippy</a> installed</li>
  <li>I had enough time to sneak down and use the family computer at night when
nobody was monitoring it</li>
  <li>We traveled back to California every once in a while</li>
  <li>Our neighbors in California hired a tutor named Steve<sup id="fnref:jobs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:jobs">1</a></sup> to tutor their
son in computer science and math</li>
  <li>Steve was kind enough to sit me down and teach me alongside my neighbor</li>
</ul>

<p>Without any one of those having occurred, I might not have started to write
code in the first place. Which might have been better for my long-term mental
health, because I consistently frustrate myself trying and failing to
understand concepts or complete projects.</p>

<h3 id="i-have-been-confused-for-ages">I have been confused for ages.</h3>

<p><em>What follows is a half-complete log of me trying and failing to understand how
programming works. It spans eleven years and much heartbreak.</em></p>

<p>I started playing with Scratch. I tried to make some games. I did not
understand how boolean logic and loops and time worked, so instead I made some
short animated movies with the block syntax.</p>

<p>I found Pippy, a small and custom Python interpreter for the OLPC, and made
some weird program that told bad jokes. I do not remember the specifics, but I
had at least figured out <code>if</code>-statements and reading input by then. It probably
took me a month to figure out why <code>input</code> would sometimes work and sometimes
give a syntax error. Nobody was around to tell me that <code>raw_input</code> was the way
to go, because <code>input</code> called <code>eval</code> on whatever the user entered. And I would
not have known what <code>eval</code> meant anyway. Nothing much came of my OLPC
programming.</p>

<p>I discovered that the crappy calculators we used for middle school math were
programmable in an obscure language called TI Basic. I heard they could be
programmed on the computer and then that program transferred to the calculator.
But we did not have the cables, so instead I spent many math classes trying to
type full programs on the little keyboard. I wrote some helper functions that
did some trigonometry problems for me. I did not understand what I was doing,
though, or how variables worked, so whenever I wanted to write a new program I
would have to go through the manual again and try and discover anew how TI
Basic worked.</p>

<p>I remembered Pippy and tried in vain to find a Pippy interpreter for Windows
XP. Alas, nobody wrote such a thing — of course — but I somehow stumbled
upon Python and fumbled my way through a Python/IDLE installation. I wrote a
math module that did more of my math homework for me. But my attempts to do
anything remotely beyond that scope were foiled. And my math teacher found out
about the module because my homework had all these unnecessary steps in them,
and my program was not smart enough to remove them. So I got in trouble.</p>

<p>At some point in here I discovered JavaScript and spent a couple days writing
small interactive websites. In order to do some kinds of logic, the internet
recommended writing code in PHP. So I spent several weeks not understanding the
difference between client-side and server-side applications, trying to embed
PHP in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. I eventually gave up. I only grasped the difference
years later.</p>

<p>Steve, the tutor from some time ago, tried to teach me something about
programming on a semi-regular basis. He used <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> as a text resource and had
me learn both in C and in Scheme. I could repeat what he did, but I could not
come up with the solutions to these problems on my own. I got really frustrated
because I could not understand what the heck <em>recursion</em> was and why it was so
important that a function could call itself.</p>

<p>In one of my English classes in high school, there was a time when the class
was sent to the computer lab to write an essay. A friend of mine was writing
something that was decidedly <em>not</em> an English essay, so I inquired further. It
turns out that he was writing a Python program to trade Bitcoin.<sup id="fnref:bitcoin" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bitcoin">2</a></sup> He
agreed to (re-)teach me the basics of Python, because I remembered
next-to-nothing. I wrote some bad code and called it a day.</p>

<p>I joined the robotics team because my aforementioned neighbor was on it and he
was the programming captain. He was the only programmer on the team and I
wanted to be of service. At this point in his career, at the age of 15, he had
already written a fully-functional parser, compiler, and virtual machine <em>in
C</em>. Because I was functionally useless and also wanted to learn how to make my
own programming language, he sent me away several times with exercises like
“write a simple stack-based math language”.<sup id="fnref:rpncalc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rpncalc">3</a></sup> I coded myself in circles
and did not grasp how the program was supposed to maintain state or even
properly read in input.</p>

<p>I took the AP Computer Science class that my high school offered. The exercises
were generally reasonably trivial and they were partner exercises. The hardest
one for me and my partner was implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm. We did not
figure it out in time and submitted a half-baked and broken solution. To this
day, I cannot recall how exactly it works without referencing some external
source.</p>

<p>Sometime during high school, I got so frustrated that I came nowhere close to
understanding programming at the level that my neighbor did. I <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/6887471/569183">turned to the
internet</a> for help. Some kind soul named Charles<sup id="fnref:charles" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:charles">4</a></sup> took
the time to write a long, well-thought-out response. I did not really
understand what he meant at first, but after a month or two of goofing off when
I should have been working at my summer job, something clicked and I wrote a
small program that accomplished part of his suggested task. It was not
Turing-complete, but it <em>worked</em>.</p>

<p>Another English class came along. In this one, my teacher had an idea of “20%
projects”, the kind that Google encourages. One day a week, we got to work on
projects of our choosing — so long as we wrote them up for the end of the
semester. I chose to re-write my crappy “programming language” as an actual
virtual machine, because I still did not understand how on Earth those were
supposed to work. I had a half-working implementation by the end of the
semester, and continued poking at it throughout my freshman year in college. I
was fortunate enough to have a mentor — my robotics coach — when everything
frequently went to hell and broke. He was there primarily for moral support and
occasionally to point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>There is too much frustration in college to post it all here. It would sound
repetitive. But I struggled in COMP 15. I struggled in COMP 40. In Web
Engineering — I think I pissed off everybody I worked with in my group. I
struggled in Operating Systems. In COMP 160. In COMP 170. I <em>still</em> do not know
what happened in Graphics (sorry, Jason!). Or the Security Capture the Flag,
for that matter (sorry, everyone on my team!). I struggled in COMP 105. In
Networks. I struggled as a TA. I only figured out how the heap data structure
was supposed to work when I got up to lead a lab about it and someone asked a
particularly tricky question. I answered student questions wrong. I told them
too much. Too little. Did not know how to teach. Did not know how to manage my
own time.</p>

<h3 id="i-will-continue-to-be-confused">I will continue to be confused.</h3>

<p>Even now, I am bashing my head against the wall trying to figure out how I want
to represent my data for the compiler I am working on. Some people react
strongly to this — “Max, but you at least understand compilers! You did XYZ
thing!”. Sometimes, sometimes not. It does not <em>feel</em> like I understand what is
going on. After years of trying and taking three separate classes about
interpreters and compilers, I have not written a functioning compiler. And this
occasionally scares me because I am supposed to work on compilers full-time
next year.</p>

<h3 id="its-okay">It’s okay.</h3>

<p>I spoke to somebody at Google who studied compilers in undergrad and got a
Master’s degree in compilers. He confessed to me that he too has not written a
compiler and sometimes worries about this. This helped me realize: I am not the
only one who feels like a fraud!</p>

<p>I spoke to my friend and co-TA Margaret, who reframed my thinking. She
explained that it is important to think in terms of <em>deltas</em>. That I should
look back over the past years and realize how much I have learned and
accomplished in that time. A year ago, where was I? I was writing a blog series
about interpreters because <em>I did not know how they worked and needed to
learn</em>. And through writing about it I — over the course of half a year —
finally figured out how the heck Lisp worked.<sup id="fnref:macros" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:macros">5</a></sup></p>

<p>There are so many wonderfully talented people who I know and admire. They</p></div></div>

<h3>When it comes to building apps in JavaScript, my go-to frameworks are Vue and React. They have their similarities, but also a bit of differences when it comes to writing code, so let’s explore some of them. </h3>
<p>This article is a continuation of my previous article about my journey to<a href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/my-journey-to-mastering-react/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> mastering React</a>. I thought it would be a good idea to make a comparison between Vue and React, but in a more specific way. Rather than analyzing the high-level differences, we’ll be taking a look at the code and the overall development experience in both technologies.</p>
<p>For this article, I decided to create the same, although a rather simple, application in Vue and React. My reasoning behind this is that I haven’t found that many examples of a comparison made on a simpler application. And it made no sense to recreate a larger application twice, especially since a <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great example</a> already exists.</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Here is an example of a screen you might see in the application. The search bar is connected to the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PokeAPI</a> and it allows you to search for Pokemon by their name or ID. After you’ve searched for a Pokemon, you can see its stats and also add it to a list of your favourite Pokemon. Afterwards, you can remove a Pokemon from the said list.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="600" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body01-768x360.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p>The project I made represents a more realistic scenario where I’ve used a <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UI library</a> and made some simple <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API requests</a>, much like you would do in a real project. This way, I was offered a much broader palette of functionalities to showcase. I have also used Typescript to mimic the workflow in Bornfight.</p>
<p>Both projects were set up in the same way, so we could clearly see the differences without worrying about different implementations between the libraries. The <a href="https://github.com/ShockwaVee/vue-react-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project’s repository</a> is located on Github, so you can check it out for yourself if you’d like. I’ve also tried to name all of the variables and components the same, but some inconsistencies might creep up. It might be a good idea to mention that a lot of the conclusions will be my own opinions which might differ from yours. <strong>I urge you to do something similar by yourself because it’s really interesting to dissect an idea this way!</strong></p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>The setup went on pretty much without any difference between the two, although Vue’s CLI made it a bit neater. The only thing that had to be installed additionally for React was <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">node-sass</a> to allow me to use SASS inside the project, but that’s about it. I’d also note that I used Vue 2 instead of Vue 3, even though Vue 3 and current React might be a bit more similar.</p>
<p><strong>This was the Vue setup with the CLI:</strong></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body02-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p><strong>And this was the same process for React:</strong></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="250" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body03-768x150.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p>I’ve additionally installed axios and the Ant Design implementation for each.</p>
<h4>Structure</h4>
<p>The structure, in the end, was pretty much the same. I did make a few more folders for the React application because they also hold the .scss files.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04.jpg 1280w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bornfight_blog_tvoric_reactvue_body04-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></figure>
<p>On the left is the React app (just the /src). As you can see most of it is the same as the Vue app, save for some default stuff generated by each app, ie. typings and .env. The only larger difference is that I made the interfaces folders for each component for React since they also hold the prop types.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>The next logical step to this would be to check out the code, so we’re going to do just that. I’ll try to follow the hierarchy of the app to make the comparisons. The App components are pretty much the same, so we’re gonna jump straight in the Search components.</p>
<p><strong>First of all, the state management is completely different in Vue 2 and React.</strong></p>
<pre>const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
const [currentPokemon, setCurrentPokemon] = useState(null);
const [favouritePokemon, setFavouritePokemon] = useState(new Set&lt;Pokemon&gt;());</pre>
<pre>data() {
&nbsp;return {
&nbsp; &nbsp;currentPokemon: null,
&nbsp; &nbsp;favouritePokemon: []
&nbsp;};
}</pre>
<p>We do have an additional property (query) on the React side, as well as a much more suitable data type for our list of favorite Pokemon. From here on out, we’ll see that React has a bit of a better symbiosis with Typescript. Declaring prop and data types was much easier in React than in Vue. <strong>But I should mention that these issues are mostly fixed with Vue 3!</strong></p>
<p>Alongside our list of favourite Pokemon, we also have our currently searched Pokemon object, as well as our search query. The initial value of our current Pokemon is null, so to change that we must fetch it from our API.</p>
<p><strong>In React, we’ll use the useCallback function to do that.</strong></p>
<pre>const fetchPokemon = useCallback(async () =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;let pokemon;
&nbsp; &nbsp;try {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pokemon = await axios(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${query}`);
&nbsp; &nbsp;} catch (e) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;notification.error({
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;message: "Pokemon doesn't exist",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;description: "A Pokemon by this ID or name does not exist."
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;});
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return;
&nbsp; &nbsp;}

&nbsp; &nbsp;setCurrentPokemon(pokemon.data);

}, [query]);

const searchPokemonByIdOrName = (idOrName: string) =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;setQuery(idOrName);
}

useEffect(() =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;if (query !== "") {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fetchPokemon();
&nbsp; &nbsp;}
}, [fetchPokemon, query]);</pre>
<p>It’s nothing that spectacular, to be honest. We use axios to get the data, so if the request is successful, we set the data with <strong>setCurrentPokemon()</strong> function and pass the Pokemon object. If you’re not familiar with this procedure, I recommend reading about it in the React docs. If it’s not successful, an error message is displayed to the user using the Ant Design’s notification system.</p>
<p>As you can see, the query is listed in the dependency array. That way React knows which data must be tracked to check for changes. We must also use <strong>useEffect</strong> to trigger fetching Pokemon. <strong>useEffect</strong> does not support async functions, but we can call async functions inside it. So, every time a query (or <strong>fetchPokemon</strong>) changes, <strong>fetchPokemon</strong> is called. To make it all work, we use the <strong>searchPokemonByIdOrName()</strong> to simply change the query and trigger everything else.</p>
<p><strong>The same thing in Vue looks something like this.</strong></p>
<pre>async searchPokemonByIdOrName(searchQuery: string | number) {
&nbsp;let pokemon;
&nbsp;try {
&nbsp; &nbsp;pokemon = await PokeService.findPokemonByIdOrName(searchQuery);
&nbsp;} catch (e) {
&nbsp; &nbsp;this.$notification.error({
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;message: "Pokemon doesn't exist",
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;description: "A Pokemon by this ID or name does not exist."
&nbsp; &nbsp;});
&nbsp; &nbsp;return;
&nbsp;}
&nbsp;this.currentPokemon = pokemon;
}</pre>
<p>The functionality is basically the same, although I have extracted the API call in a separate class to prevent polluting the component. In hindsight, this probably wasn’t necessary and would work the same as in the React app.</p>
<p><strong>Just for reference, I’ll show you the PokeService class so you can see no funny business is happening inside.</strong></p>
<pre>export class PokeService {
&nbsp;static async findPokemonByIdOrName(idOrName: string | number) {
&nbsp; &nbsp;let pokemon;
&nbsp; &nbsp;try {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;pokemon = (await Vue.axios.get(`/pokemon/${idOrName}`)) as AxiosResponse;
&nbsp; &nbsp;} catch (e) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return Promise.reject(e);
&nbsp; &nbsp;}

&nbsp; &nbsp;return Promise.resolve(pokemon.data);
&nbsp;}
}</pre>
<p>Hopping back to our component, the whole process is much simpler in Vue. We can just assign the Pokemon object to our data property and Vue handles the rest for us. To be fair, I handled the Vue part in a bit more declarative way, so the amount of code is smaller in Vue. <strong>Vue does a lot more for us under the hood than React. This is great for the majority of the cases, but sometimes we need the low-level control React offers us.</strong></p>
<p>Adding and removing favorites is pretty straightforward, but there are some conversions happening to the array when filtering. That is because filtering isn’t supported on a set. </p>
<p><strong>You can see this in the code for React.</strong></p>
<pre>const addToFavourites = (pokemon: Pokemon) &nbsp;=&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;setFavouritePokemon(new Set&lt;Pokemon&gt;([...Array.from(favouritePokemon), pokemon]))
}

const removeFromFavourites = (id: number) =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp;const filteredFavouritePokemon = Array.from(favouritePokemon).filter((pokemon: Pokemon) =&gt; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return pokemon.id !== id;
&nbsp; &nbsp;})
&nbsp; &nbsp;setFavouritePokemon(new Set(filteredFavouritePokemon));
}</pre>
<p>In Vue, functions are named a bit differently, but they do the same thing. They do it in a different way because <strong>favouritePokemon</strong> in Vue is declared as an array, instead of a set. Other than this, I’d say this part is pretty much the same since it represents our business logic.</p>
<pre>onAddToFavourites(pokemon: Pokemon) {
&nbsp;const pokemonSet: Set&lt;Pokemon&gt; = new Set(this.favouritePokemon);
&nbsp;pokemonSet.add(pokemon);
&nbsp;this.favouritePokemon = Array.from(pokemonSet);
},
onRemoveFromFavourites(id: number) {
&nbsp;this.favouritePokemon = this.favouritePokemon.filter(
&nbsp; &nbsp;(pokemon: Pokemon) =&gt; pokemon.id !== id
&nbsp;);
}</pre>
<p>I used a set in both cases to prevent the user from having the same favourite Pokemon multiple times.</p>
<p>Now we’re going to take a look at the templates of these components. </p>
<p><strong>The first one is for React.</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;div&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;SearchBar onSearch={searchPokemonByIdOrName} /&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div className={styles.wrapper}&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonDetails pokemon={currentPokemon} addFavouritePokemon={addToFavourites}/&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonList favouritePokemon={favouritePokemon} removeFavourite={removeFromFavourites}/&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p><strong>And the other one is for Vue.</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;template&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;div&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;SearchBar :on-search="searchPokemonByIdOrName"&gt;&lt;/SearchBar&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonDetails
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:pokemon="currentPokemon"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@add-to-favourites="onAddToFavourites"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&lt;/PokemonDetails&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;PokemonList
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:favourite-pokemon="favouritePokemon"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;@remove-favourite="onRemoveFromFavourites"
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;&lt;/PokemonList&gt;
&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;</pre>
<p>As you can see, there isn’t much difference between the two. It’s a bit of a different syntax for passing down props, but other than that it’s kind of the same.</p>
<p>There is this weird <strong>@</strong> symbol dotted around in the Vue template. I will explain this in a bit, but this is the <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two-way component communication in Vue</a>, between a parent and a child component. We can send props down to the child, but the child can inform the parent about some changes using events. <strong>React doesn’t have its own version of events since it promotes a unidirectional data flow between components.</strong></p>

    <h2><strong>Podcasting is my favorite thing</strong></h2><p>In May 2018, I launched my first podcast. It's called <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/upside/id1379955436" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">upside</a>, and it's still going strong! My cohost and I have published a new episode every week for the last 2.5 years.</p>

          <p><strong>One of the most frequent questions I'm asked is </strong><em>how </em>I got these results and <em>how </em>I make the show sound so good.</p><p>I put a <em>ton </em>of work into Creative Elements. I'm very proud of it. My goal is to create a show that sounds as good as something on NPR or Gimlet.</p><p>But...I'm just one guy. I don't have the skills or resources that those big shows have. <strong>So I've learned to adapt and do the best that I can with what I have.</strong> I don't spend a ton of money on production, but the show sounds really, really good.</p>

          <p>For every episode of my show, I'm concerned with telling a good story. Good stories have a narrative arch, every bit of the story is purposeful, and it is engaging.</p><p>Most interviews don't sound like that out-of-the-box. So I spend a lot of time reorganizing, cutting, scripting, recording voiceover, and pulling in external audio.</p><p>In this course, I walk you through how I think about those creative decisions and how I do it all in ~5 hours of work.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Business performance improves when technologists are empowered, when they have the right environment, and when points of friction are removed. </p></blockquote>
<p>Early in David Theriault’s career as a developer, he was called to attend a meeting with management, in which the bosses discussed how to fill developers’ time. Managers proceeded to allocate the developers’ full schedules in 15-minute blocks for over a week out, Theriault recalls.</p>
<p>In other words, the managers predetermined how much time projects should take without any room for possible overages, Theriault says. Then, the managers got into a discussion about what they should do with the developers’ remaining time – literally 15 minutes at the end of the week.</p>
<p>“It was demeaning to think you’re basically punching in and out and there was no room for anything creative or any training,’’ Theriault says.</p>
<p>It didn’t stop there. The managers also assigned each developer to a group with QA, product, and design people. In effect they created silos, instead of allowing for dialogue and relationship building across teams “so they don’t feel so isolated and stagnant,’’ Theriault says. “At the time, I was a junior developer and I thought, ‘I won’t make much forward progress here.’” Ultimately, he left.</p>
<p>Today, Theriault is a manager in the analytics division at <a href="https://www.tracelink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TraceLink</a>, which specializes in pharmaceutical&nbsp;supply chain management. Fortunately, he no longer has to deal with the factory-like approach to software development.</p>
<p>You’d think organizations would have mastered how to develop software effectively by now. Yet, while many have invested in software development, those investments have not led to meaningful performance improvements, according to a report from McKinsey.</p>
<p>“Leaders still struggle to scale promising sandbox innovations, the firm <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> in April. “We often hear CEOs, chief technology officers, and chief information officers lament that their software development spending is a ‘black box.’”</p>
<h3>Thinking outside the black box</h3>
<p>It doesn’t need to be that dire. Business performance through software development improves when developers are empowered and they have the right environment in which to innovate, and points of friction are removed, according to McKinsey.</p>
<p>Developers, not surprisingly, agree wholeheartedly. They say they thrive when they are trusted and allowed to do their work autonomously.</p>
<p>“The single thing that defines developer empowerment for me is being able to code fearlessly,’’ says Ben Boyter, technical lead for <a href="https://www.kablamo.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kablamo</a>, a cloud&nbsp;services provider in Sydney, Australia. “You need to be able to make any change you want to the system as a whole, small or large, with such a low cost for failure that you are no longer afraid to try things.”</p>
<p>A developer should be checking code, knowing that they can revert mistakes they made, says Boyter, who wrote a <a href="https://boyter.org/posts/developer-empowerment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> about developer empowerment in 2019. Development teams should also deploy code with the understanding that they can roll it back&nbsp;if it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>“They should be confident that once they check their code … <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/5-rules-for-successful-test-automation/">the system it supports should be tested in an automated way</a>, so even if they make a simple mistake it will be picked up,’’ Boyter adds. “Or that even if not, monitoring systems will give an idea that something has changed, and maybe even tell you what system it affects.”</p>
<p>Yet, Boyter believes&nbsp;that companies don’t allow for this because they are afraid of failure, and don’t accept is that <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-recognize-the-warning-signs-of-a-project-crisis/">failure is normal and part of the process</a>. “Nobody is perfect, no amount of testing is going to catch every bug, no code is perfect, and even formal proofs are only as good as their requirements,” he notes.</p>
<p>When companies learn to accept that software development is iterative, and build failure into the development equation, “You can own it,” says Boyter. “Once you own failure, you can then control it and make it work for you. Suddenly,&nbsp;large sweeping changes are no longer scary.”</p>
<p>The end result? Developers can code fearlessly, Boyter says. “And as such, they will feel empowered.”</p>
<h3>Start with trust</h3>
<p>Being an empowered developer means that you are trusted to get the work done and your time is respected, agrees Greg Reed, co-founder and technical director of digital product agency&nbsp;<a href="https://thisissoon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOON</a>, based in London.</p>
<p>When a developer is empowered, “People in the organization listen to you and actively seek your advice,’’ Reed says.&nbsp;“You’re allowed to say no. In fact, you’re <em>expected</em> to say no, and you’re trusted to make good decisions.&nbsp;You’re given the space to explore and research new technologies and time to refactor and improve old ones.”</p>
<p>Ariel Illouz, senior software engineer at software development company <a href="https://linearb.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinearB</a> in Israel, says he’s not only a empowered developer, but he empower his team as well. For example, LinearB establishes areas of responsibility (AORs), such as customer success and cloud infrastructure cost. He and every developer on his team has their own AOR. Each developer manages their AOR and reports on it weekly, Illouz says. “This level of responsibility and trust is empowering for individual developers.”</p>
<h3><strong>Give people the freedom to resolve issues</strong></h3>
<p>Today’s developers and testers are responsible for bigger codebases spanning more languages and technologies than ever before, notes Theriault. And since they are in the code day-in and day out, they’re the only people who know if there’s a component that won’t scale, or a security vulnerability, or any one of a hundred other issues.</p>
<p>If the developers don’t raise the issue, no one else is likely to until it’s too late – until it’s affecting customers, Theriault says.&nbsp;“Empowered developers are the <em>only </em>ones who can solve these problems.”</p>
<p>Further, organizations have to acknowledge that issues are not just a software development problem, observes Reed.&nbsp;“The organization and all the stakeholders have to be committed to a process of prioritization, iteration, and improvement.&nbsp;As teams, we’ve invented all these buzzwords – agile, user research, user experience, minimum viable product – in order to focus effort and build confidence that what we’re developing will lead to meaningful performance improvements.”</p>
<p>There has to be space to implement and refine these processes to get the results, Reed says.</p>
<p>Illouz sees two main issues organizations have with software development: losing things that fall between the cracks and innovation.</p>
<p>“Whether you’re a startup with limited resources or a new hybrid remote team, things get forgotten about, priorities change, and bugs come up,’’ Illouz says. “By giving my team members direct areas of responsibility without much oversight, they take ownership and fewer issues are forgotten about.”</p>
<p>Take time for a retrospective at the end of each sprint and listen to developers. If managers don’t do this, they lose out on a lot of value, Illouz says.</p>
<p>“We then test the idea to see if it works. If someone fails at being better, that’s not a bad thing. Fail fast, learn from it, and keep moving forward,’’ Illouz says. “But you always have to provide an environment based on trust.”</p>
<h3>How to become an empowered developer</h3>
<p>Empowered developers are creative,&nbsp;they tinker, and they find clever solutions, says Theriault.&nbsp;They are proactive. They identify and solve issues before they reach the customer.</p>
<p>The ability to become one starts with the organization adopting an open mindset, techies say.</p>
<p>“It’s tough, but you’ve got to learn to say no,’’ says Reed. “Start having those difficult conversations with your project managers and stakeholders.&nbsp;You have to be honest about how long things take, and you have to raise the alarm when you know it can’t be done.”</p>
<p>That way, scope can be reduced, things are appropriately prioritized, and the software team members can focus their efforts on the things that produce the best possible outcomes.</p>
<p>Developers and testers also have to take responsibility. If the codebase is poor, or they inherited a restrictive system, or there’s a culture of writing bad code because there’s no time to do it any other way – they have to fix it.&nbsp;“Clean it up, build in time to refactor, create tests, and make it yours,’’ Reed says.</p>
<p>Also, “Ask yourself, do you have confidence in what you are making? What problem are you trying to solve and does the solution make sense?”&nbsp;If it doesn’t, you have to give your input and start a discussion. You should feel confident that what you’re developing is going to have an impact, Reed says.</p>
<p>But, Reed adds, “If you try all these things and your company still doesn’t take you seriously, then I’m afraid it’s time to leave.”</p>
<p>Theriault echoes that sentiment. “If developers see that their warnings fall on deaf ears then they will simply stop raising the alarm.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">Leaders need to listen</a>.&nbsp;I tell my team I want us to build software that we’re all proud of.”</p>
<p>Since developers know where the weak points&nbsp;are, Theriault says, “I need them to raise the issue, file the bug and in return, my pledge to them is that action will be taken, we will schedule the fixes and at every iteration, we will get stronger.”</p>

        <p><strong><em>TL;DR check out the <a href="#color-functions">Color Functions</a> below.</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> is to get access to its <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color">color functions</a> like <code>lighten</code>, <code>darken</code>, and <code>transparentize</code>. These functions are useful because allow defining a color once, then dynamically generating variants of that color for different uses.</p>
<p>For example, here's an <code>alert</code> component that needs three shades of blue.</p>
<p data-height="150" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="gschier" data-slug-hash="VwjYazv" data-pen-title="VwjYazv">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/gschier/pen/VwjYazv">
  yLJajep</a> by Gregory Schier (<a href="https://codepen.io/gschier">@gschier</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>


<p>With the help of the <code>transparentize</code> and <code>darken</code> SASS functions we can generate the color variants needed for the light background and dark text.</p>
<div>
        
        <pre data-line=""><code>$color: #4299E1; // Blue

.alert {  
  // Subtle tinted background
  background-color: transparentize($color, 0.9);

  // Colored border
  border: 1px solid $color;

  // Color text, darkened for good contrast
  color: darken($color, 20%);
}</code></pre>

        </div>
        
<p>But, what if you can't use a preprocessor? Well, you're in luck! CSS doesn't include built-in color functions, but <strong>this post demonstrates how to combine <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS Custom Properties (variables)</a> with the <code>hsl</code> color model to achieve the same thing.</strong></p>
<p>To implement these color manipulations, we need to think outside the box. Here's the general strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Break colors into three variables: hue, saturation, and lightness</li>
<li>Combine HSL variables with <code>hsl(360, 100%, 100%)</code> color syntax</li>
<li>Use the CSS <code>calc</code> function to manipulate HSL variables</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the previous <code>alert</code> component implemented using our vanilly-CSS strategy.</p>
<div>
        
        <pre data-line=""><code>:root {
  --color-h: 207; /* Hue        */
  --color-s: 73%; /* Saturation */
  --color-l: 57%; /* Lightness  */
}

.alert {
  /* Colored border */
  border: 2px solid hsl(
    var(--color-h), 
    var(--color-s), 
    var(--color-l)
  );

  /* Subtle tinted background */
  background-color: hsla(
    var(--color-h),
    var(--color-s),
    var(--color-l),
    0.1
  );

  /* Color text, darkened for good contrast */
  color: hsl(
    var(--color-h), 
    var(--color-s), 
    calc(var(--color-l) * 0.7)
  );
}

/*
 * BONUS!
 * 
 * CSS variables are scoped, so can easily be changed
 * based on a given class.
 *
 * In SASS, this would actually be MORE difficult, requiring
 * use of mixins.
 */
.alert.danger {
  --color-h: 0; /* Change hue to red */
}</code></pre>

        </div>
        
<p>The resulting output is the exact same as the SASS example, except we didn't need a preprocessor to do it! 🤯</p>

<h2 id="color-functions" tabindex="0">Color Functions<a href="#color-functions">#</a></h2>
<p>The first example in this post demonstrated how to darkening a color and adding transparency, but there's a lot more that can be done too. Here are the most useful examples.</p>
<h3 id="shift-hue" tabindex="0">Shift Hue<a href="#shift-hue">#</a></h3>
<p>The hue can be rotated by adding a value, in degrees, to the hue variable. Note, hue ranges from 0-360 degrees but will still work if it's exceeded (ie. <code>30</code> is the same hue as <code>30 + 360 = 390</code>)</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  calc(var(--color-h) + 80),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="transparentize-alpha" tabindex="0">Transparentize (Alpha)<a href="#transparentize-alpha">#</a></h3>
<p>Transparency can be set using <code>hsla</code> to specify the desired alpha value.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsla(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l),
  0.5 /* specify alpha channel */
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="adjust-lightness" tabindex="0">Adjust Lightness<a href="#adjust-lightness">#</a></h3>
<p>Lightness can be adjusted by multiplying by a value greater than <code>0</code>. Values between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> will darken, while values greater than <code>1</code> will lighten.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 &lt; n &lt; 1 darkens, n &gt; 1 lightens */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  calc(var(--color-l) * 0.4)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="darken-to-black" tabindex="0">Darken to Black<a href="#darken-to-black">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula uses <code>lightness - (lightness * v)</code> to essentially mix a color with black. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be black.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (black) */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  var(--color-s),
  calc(var(--color-l) - var(--color-l) * 0.3)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="lighten-to-white" tabindex="0">Lighten to White<a href="#lighten-to-white">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula that uses <code>lightness + (100% - lightness) * v</code> to essentially mix a color with white. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be white.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (white) */

);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="adjust-saturation" tabindex="0">Adjust Saturation<a href="#adjust-saturation">#</a></h3>
<p>Saturation can be adjusted by multiplying by a value greater than <code>0</code>. Values between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> will decrease saturation, while values greater than <code>1</code> will increate saturation.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  calc(var(--color-s) * 0.6),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="saturate" tabindex="0">Saturate<a href="#saturate">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula uses <code>saturation + (100% - saturation) * v</code> to increase saturation from the current saturation to full. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be 100% saturated.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (full) */

);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="desaturate" tabindex="0">Desaturate<a href="#desaturate">#</a></h3>
<p>This formula uses <code>saturation - (saturation * v)</code> to decrease saturation from the current saturation to grayscale. A value of <code>0</code> will have no effect and a value of <code>1</code> will be entirely grayscale.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>/* 0 (no change) to 1 (grayscale) */
hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  calc(var(--color-s) - var(--color-s) * 0.6),
  var(--color-l)

</div>
<h3 id="grayscale" tabindex="0">Grayscale<a href="#grayscale">#</a></h3>
<p>A color can be converted to grayscale by setting the saturation component to <code>0%</code>.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  var(--color-h),
  0%, /* Remove saturation component */
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="complement" tabindex="0">Complement<a href="#complement">#</a></h3>
<p>The compliment of a color can be calculated by rotating the hue 180 degrees.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>hsl(
  calc(var(--color-h) + 180),
  var(--color-s),
  var(--color-l)
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h3 id="invert-bonus" tabindex="0">Invert (BONUS)<a href="#invert-bonus">#</a></h3>
<p>This is the only SASS color function we cannot using the HSL model. But, if you really need to calculate a color's inverse, we can define additional RGB variables for our color and use them to calculate the inverse.</p>


<div><pre data-line=""><code>:root {
  --color-r: 65;
  --color-g: 153;
  --color-b: 225;

  calc(255 - var(--color-b))
);</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id="why-do-this" tabindex="0">Why Do This?<a href="#why-do-this">#</a></h2>
<p>We've just seen how vanilla CSS can be used to manipulate colors but <strong>why wouldn't we just use a preprocessor?</strong> Well, even though CSS is more verbose, there <em>are</em> some benefits.</p>
<p><strong>1) Dynamic theming:</strong><br>
The largest benefit of CSS variables variables is the ability to change them at runtime using JavaScript<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This makes adding dark mode or user-customizable themes trivial, for example. In fact, <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> relies heavily on CSS variables for it's theme system.</p>
<p><strong>2) Scoped variables:</strong><br> 
We saw in the previous example how we generated a red alert by simply changing the hue variable within the <code>.alert.danger</code> selector. This is because CSS variables are scoped. Since SASS does not support scoping like this, we'd have to add complexity by using <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin">mixins</a> instead.</p>
<p><strong>3) Preprocessors are a pain:</strong><br>
Not having to setup a preprocessor like SASS can be a huge benefit for simple projects and beginners. There are also some projects where a preprocessing step won't be an option at all.</p>
<p>So, with a little creative thinking, we were able to implement all off SASS's color manipulation functions using CSS variables and <code>calc()</code>. Perhaps one day CSS will have these functions build in but, until then, this will suffice.</p>

October 21, 2020 | https://artofemails.com/trump-emails | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://artofemails.com/trump-emails">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2>Trump sends on average 10-12 emails a day</h2>
<p>Here's a look at the emails his team sent in one day:
<img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-how-many-emails-a-day.png" alt="Trump sends 10-12 emails a day on average">
</p><h2>Trump uses several different sender names for his emails</h2>
<p>Trump’s team uses different senders names for his emails including:
</p><p>Official Trump Campaign Store
<br>Donald J. Trump
<br>Trump 1000 Club
<br>Donald Trump Jr.
<br>Eric Trump
<br>Official Trump Polling
<br>Trump Match Alert
<br>Mike Pence
</p><p>
Different sender names lets them resend similar offers and messages with a fresh approach. For example, they often offer a 800% donation match in their emails and one of them came from Donald Trump Jr. saying:
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Nothing can keep my father down.
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-sender-name.png" alt="Trump uses different sender names for his emails">
</p></div>
<h2>Subject lines are often short and punchy; the longest ones are only 8-9 words.</h2>
<p>Interesting subject lines:
</p><p>(1) UNOPENED MESSAGE
<br>You + Me in LA
<br>You’re going to love this.
</p><h2>Psychological tactics that Trump's emails use often</h2>
<h5>Match incentives</h5>
<p>Trump’s emails often offer a 800% match for donations to give supporters the feeling making even a small contribution would make a difference. These emails have buttons with different donation amounts and their total amount after the 800% match.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>800%-MATCH
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive.png" alt="Trump email 800% matching incentive">
</p></div>
<p>Using different approaches, Trump’s team sends the most emails about his offer to match donations.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>📎 Matching Check Attached
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive-2.png" alt="Trump email 800% matching check">
</p></div>
<h5>Exclusivity</h5>
<p>In some emails, Trump taps into people’s desire to feel like they belong to something bigger than themselves. They position donating to the campaign as joining an exclusive club and elevate its prestige by offering a personalized membership card.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Become a Platinum Member
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-exclusivity-personalized-membership-card.png" alt="Trump email donate to join exclusive club">
</p></div>
<p>The Trump team sends different versions of this approach so they feel like fresh offers.
</p><p>Here’s one from Kimberly Guilfoyle, an advisor to Donald Trump, inviting you to join the exclusive Trump 100 Club.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>You’re going to love this.
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-exclusivity-100-club.png" alt="Trump email donate to join 100 club">
</p></div>
<h5>Ego boost</h5>
<p>A handful of Trump’s emails try to make you feel special and give you the opportunity to stand out as a highly valued supporter.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>I want to do something special for you
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-ego-boost.png" alt="Trump emails donate to join 100 club">
</p></div>
<h5>Win something</h5>
<p>A few of Trump’s emails offer you the chance to win a trip to meet him if you make a donation. Beyond having your travel expenses covered, they tap into your desire to meet someone important.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>🌞 Sunny LA 🌞
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-win-trip-to-la.png" alt="Win a trip to LA to meet Trump">
</p></div>
<h5>Guilt</h5>
<p>Some of Trump’s emails encourage you to donate by creating the feeling that he’s really counting on you and you’d be letting him down if you don't.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>Contribution Status: MISSING
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-matching-incentive-3.png" alt="Trump's matching incentive: don't let him down">
</p></div>
<p>This email explicitly says Trump would be disappointed if you did not donate, with a picture of him looking sternly at you.
</p><div id="email-template"><p><mark>President Trump is calling on his top supporters
</mark></p><p><img src="https://artofemails.com/img/trump-emails-900-matching-incentive.png" alt="Trump would be disappointed if you didn't donate">

October 21, 2020 | https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-radar-2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-radar-2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Insurance tech is having its moment. Startups in the space received <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/posts/insurtech-startups-investor-quality-q2-q3-2020">$33b of funding</a> in 2019, the largest amount in the industry’s short history. As we head into the last quarter of 2020, we’re seeking to better understand where insurtech startups are filling traditional insurance market gaps.</p><p>Insurance products compete on two axes: customer experience and underwriting accuracy. Over the past half-decade, insurtech startups have used machine learning and data collection capabilities to hit on both of these axes, catering to digital, transparent, on-demand consumer preferences. Customers can now manage the entire insurance experience online — from policy shopping to claims settlement — with lower premiums than traditional insurers.&nbsp;</p><p>                                                       <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/app/insurance_now">The full Radar can be found <strong>here</strong>.</a></p><p>To dig into the startups in this area, we turned to our <a href="https://radicleinsights.com/products/radar">Radar</a> product, <em>a market map on steroids</em> that adds context to sectors and helps identify startups filling market gaps. In this Radar, we identified 20 sectors filling 3 primary market gaps: a product experience gap, an insurance product gap, and an underwriting gap. This piece briefly walks through each gap with example startups in each category.</p><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/radiclewebsite/502a4c68-a736-436e-b36d-12e80f6dd6ba_Screen+Shot+2020-09-14+at+2.34.51+PM.png?auto=compress,format" alt=""></p><p><strong>Product Experience Gap</strong></p><p>The product experience gap fills in a key hole where legacy insurers have traditionally failed: customer experience. New-age, digital solutions are providing transparent policies, immediate claim fulfillment, and active customer support. Solutions addressing this gap sit across the entire spectrum of insurance products. Example sectors include Auto Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://clearcover.com/">Clearcover</a>), Travel Insurance Providers (<a href="https://pluto.travel/cover">Pluto</a>), and Homeowners Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://www.hippo.com/">Hippo</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Take Clearcover as an example. Clearcover offers simple, online-only auto insurance with an improved customer experience. Through the company's app, policyholders can instantly file claims (which are paid within a few days), manage bill payments, and provide proof of insurance without the need for a wifi connection or cell service. Additionally, Clearcover's policies include "alternate transport coverage," a more flexible repair stipend compared to traditional insurer's rental car coverage. With alternate transport coverage, Clearcover customers can spend their stipend on public transportation, rental car coverage, and ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft.</p><p>Or consider Pluto, a travel insurance provider. Pluto addresses the opaque and bureaucratic qualities of the travel insurance industry by making policies easy to understand. Through Pluto's smartphone app, customers can evaluate and purchase jargon-free coverage options, receive access to medical assistance, and submit claims for events like flight delays in 10 minutes or less.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insurance Product Gap</strong></p><p>The insurance product gap addresses cohorts that previously had little or no coverage. This encompasses solutions like Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers (<a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a>), Ridesharing Insurance (<a href="https://www.buckleup.com/">Buckle</a>), and Drone Insurance Digital Brokers (<a href="https://www.thimble.com/verifly-drone-insurance">Thimble</a>).</p><p>One start-up addressing the insurance product gap is <a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a> (Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers), a home insurance provider for rental hosts. Since standard homeowner’s insurance policies don’t cover Airbnb rentals, home-share hosts are vulnerable to denied claims or even canceled coverage if their insurer discovers that their home doubles as a business. Slice helps solve this problem by supplementing a host’s existing homeowner’s policy and eliminating the possibility of losses being reported to the host’s insurer. What’s more, Slice is unique in that its insurance offering is completely on-demand: coverage is billed by the night, and hosts only pay for the exact amount of coverage they need.&nbsp;</p><p>Other startups like <a href="https://www.buckleup.com/">Buckle</a> focus on underserved segments of the auto market. Buckle provides rideshare drivers with one policy to cover their personal driving and rideshare driving. Instead of supplementing an existing auto policy, Buckle replaces a driver’s current auto insurance and provides continuous 24x7 coverage at one low rate. While traditional insurance companies evaluate factors like age and driving history, Buckle takes other driving elements into account, such as rideshare star rating. Buckle launched its core rideshare insurance policy in 2019 and announced a partnership with Lyft earlier this year.</p><p><strong>Underwriting Gap</strong></p><p>The underwriting gap addresses high consumer policy cost through providing more accurate, personalized underwriting. This encompasses solutions like Auto Insurance Digital Carriers (<a href="https://www.metromile.com/">Metromile</a>, <a href="https://www.joinroot.com/">Root</a>) and Short-Term Rental Property Insurance Carriers (<a href="https://www.slice.is/">Slice</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Startups like <a href="https://www.metromile.com/">Metromile</a> provide coverage based on miles driven, tracking mileage using an in-car dongle that pairs to a smartphone app, while <a href="https://www.joinroot.com/">Root</a> considers over 200 driving behavior variables such as braking, driving time of day, miles driven, and more.

     <p><i>By Wojciech Gryc on October 20, 2020</i>
     
     </p><center><img src="https://phaseai.com/static/img/blogpost_portfolio_full.jpg"></center>

     <p>An important part of seeking a data-oriented job is putting together a data science portfolio. Portfolios help candidates stand out to hiring managers and potential companies they could work at.

     </p><h2>Why have a portfolio?</h2>

     <p>Most data professionals are subject matter experts and have deep areas of expertise, but this also makes it difficult for people to understand what they actually do. A hiring manager or recruiter reviewing 100s of resumes and CVs doesn't have the time to understand each candidate's expertise, jargon, or nuanced innovations.

     </p><h2>Put yourself in the hiring manager's shoes</h2>

     <p>Help the hiring manager understand your capabilities by emphasizing the end-to-end projects you've organized and launched; make sure to describe everything in plain language.
     
     </p><p>First, begin by picking one project that best emphasizes your fit for a specific role. Describe the problem you addressed and how you solved it. Limit your discussion to 3 or 4 sentences, and use visual cues (screenshots, diagrams, or photographs) where you can. Most importantly, avoid jargon!
     
     </p><p>Your ultimate goal is to ensure those reading your project overview will be able to describe it to someone else. It's OK if they miss the technical nuances, as long as they understand what problem you solved and how effective your solution was.

     </p><h2>A checklist for your portfolio</h2>

     <p>Here are some specific pieces of advice:
</p><ul><li>Pick one project to emphasize; one you either ran or where you made a very clear contribution.
</li><li>Emphasize your role and what innovation, data research, or piece of work you completed there.
</li><li>Link to the end result, whether it was a research paper, conference talk, product launch, or something else.
</li><li>If possible, include visual cues, screenshots, photographs, or diagrams. This makes the portfolio engaging and more interesting.
</li><li>Summarize the above in 3 sentences and practice speaking about it. Avoid jargon to ensure non-experts understand what the project was about.
</li></ul>

     <p>The last point is critical: given the many candidates recruiters and hiring managers speak with, being able to summarize the end result without any jargon will help those hiring for the role remember it, speak to their colleagues about it, and ultimately evangelize you as a candidate. If you have a visual component to the portfolio, then that makes it shareable, too!

     </p><h2>Pro-tip: build a personal website</h2>

     <p>Candidates often ask if having a personal website is helpful, and our recommendation is <i>yes</i>. You need not have a fancy one, but the point is to have your latest resume there, along with links to your portfolio. Leading with a visual, pithy (3 sentences!) summary of each portfolio item will enable the hiring manager to review the work quickly and share it easily with colleagues. Most importantly, it'll help them understand how you will contribute to their own company's data science objectives.

                  <p>Want to get better at something or at least do it more? Make it as easy as possible.</p>

<p>I’ve been making music at home for a long time, and have been talking to people about making music at home for even longer. During that time, the single best piece of advice I’ve gotten from people I admire is this: leave your gear set up.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.reifyworks.com/images/1*J1S_DFJBFoikbMv2-vk-jA.jpeg" alt="Buy my records please"><em>Buy my records please</em></p>

<p>If you want to play more, or get better, or both, having everything all set up and ready to go will make you approximately 1,000,000 times more likely to actually do it. This is scientifically proven.</p>

<p>It occurred to me the other day that this idea potentially generalizes to a whole bunch of other things that people typically want to do more or get better at: exercising, writing, making pottery, whatever.</p>

<p>The basic idea is this: make it as easy as possible to just get started and you’ll be so much more likely to actually do it. For running, maybe that means setting time aside and setting your clothes and shoes out the night before. Writing? A quiet spot and fifteen minutes should be enough.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What gear do I have stashed in the closet, messy and unplugged, that should actually be out and ready on my desk, ready to make my next hit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you’ve got your answer, take tonight to set it up, and make tomorrow day one of a long, fulfilling streak.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Back in 2010 I was contemplating my next move after working on Microsoft's Project Oslo. Oslo was an effort to deliver 10X productivity to developers which inspired me to set the following criteria for my next job:</p><ol><li><strong>Iterate with Developers:</strong> I want to work in a place where we can start small, get something in the hands of developers and then iterate over the product to solve real problems.</li><li><strong>Cloud:</strong> So far I had been focussed on building platforms using bare-metal products.  But I was starting to see the kind of requirements modern applications have around scale and resiliency.  I knew Cloud had to be huge part of the experience to deliver on those requirements.</li></ol><h2>Start of Journey</h2><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jv8et2b448mjtifrh1wy.png" alt="Alt Text"></p><p>The Oslo framework led me to join the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/swf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Simple Workflow (SWF)</a> team.  The team was led by Maxim Fateev, who came from a strong messaging background. Maxim was one of the most brilliant software engineers I had ever worked with, especially when it came to designing large scale distributed systems.  Little did I know that I was about to embark on a long journey which is still being written to this day.</p><p>When I joined, the team was wrapping up a second version of the service which was already seeing decent usage within AWS.  Even at the time, we could clearly see a pattern emerging. Developers were spending significant amounts of time building resiliency into applications, using low level primitives like queues, databases, retry mechanisms, durable timers, etc. Those same developers were able to produce higher quality systems with far less effort when using SWF instead of implementing resiliency themselves.  Considering how useful the service was within AWS, the next natural step was to offer SWF publicly. I was part of the core team which worked on the public version of SWF which was launched in early 2012.</p><h2>Durable Task Framework (DTFx)</h2><p><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/monitor.png"></p><p>After shipping the public SWF service, I took an opportunity at Microsoft Azure and ended up joining the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/service-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Service Bus</a> team that owns the messaging stack for Azure.  Cloud was steadily gaining momentum and as more and more workloads started to get migrated, teams like Azure Service Bus became a focal point.  As application developers increasingly started adopting microservices architecture to keep up with scale and availability requirements for modern applications, services like Azure Service Bus became the backbone to orchestrate calls across microservices.  To keep up with the explosive growth, I worked as part of the team focused on large scale ingestion through <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure EventHubs</a>.  This solved the scalability and reliability issues at a messaging layer but developers still had to work with very low level primitives whenever they need to reliably orchestrate calls across microservices.  The result was complex architectures which were expensive to build, hard to operate, and still came with reliability challenges. Reliability challenges stemming from all sorts of failure cases which needed to be handled due to the distributed nature of the application.</p><p>I could clearly see that the developers building applications on Microsoft Azure were facing eerily similar challenges to what I had seen back at AWS. The same challenges we had tried to address with SWF.  So I used one of the internal team hackathons as an opportunity to pair up with Affan Dar and take another stab at solving the problem. Affan had a very deep understanding of Azure ServiceBus so he was the perfect person to build the backend for the stateful C# experience I had in mind.  Microsoft had recently added async/await capabilities into C# and it turned out to be an amazing fit for writing stateful applications which need to orchestrate calls among microservices.  Since Java lacked an async/await like primitive, we had to rely on Promise-based async approach when building SWF.  But with C#, we were able to deliver a much cleaner and synchronous programming model using async/await.  This hackathon project resulted in Azure <a href="https://github.com/Azure/durabletask" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Durable Task Framework</a> as an OSS client SDK which uses Azure ServiceBus as the backend to provide a stateful workflow-as-code experience for applications. I'm so glad to see Microsoft has continued investing in the experience with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Durable Functions</a> as the latest reincarnation of the original effort. An effort which started with that hackathon project.</p><h2>Transportation as Reliable as Running Water</h2><p><img src="https://d3i4yxtzktqr9n.cloudfront.net/uber-sites/f452c7aefd72a6f52b36705c8015464e.jpg"></p><p>In 2015, Uber opened a development center in Seattle and I decided to take the leap and join the engineering team.  Coincidently enough, Maxim Fateev ended up joining the Uber team in Seattle only a month after I did. At the time, Uber was running on Kafka 7 as the messaging backbone. Based on the scale they were running, they were encountering some serious operational issues. Considering Maxim and I had more than a decade worth of experience building messaging systems similar to Kafka, we decided to create the OSS project <a href="https://github.com/uber-archive/cherami-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherami</a> to address this Uber sized problem. After a year of working on the project, we were observing a very similar pattern to the one that we tried to solve with SWF and Durable Task Framework. When engineers needed to build with raw infrastructure primitives like queues and databases they were spending 80% of their time building resiliency into the application.  This was clearly not sustainable for Uber, which was growing at an amazing pace and building a brand of "Transportation as Reliable as Running Water".  This need to increase developer productivity without compromising on reliability of the system was the motivation for Maxim and I to create the OSS project <a href="https://github.com/uber/cadence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cadence</a>.  Within a very short period of time, we built a multi-tenant service hosted by our team. Cadence provided a great developer experience by enabling developers to use Golang to build and run stateful applications with very little operational overhead.  Cadence grew organically within Uber and quickly became popular among developers. It slowly but surely began to emerge as the standard way to build stateful applications when reliability cannot be compromised.</p><h2>Magic of Open Source</h2><p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8llekr4lqjmaok138su4.png" alt="Alt Text"></p><p>Today, more businesses are turning to software for running mission critical parts of the system and software is becoming key part of the end-user experience. The problems faced by engineers at places like AWS, Microsoft Azure and Uber have become more and more common across the industry.  This belief was validated in early 2019. Developers from companies like Hashicorp, Box, Doordash, Checkr and dozens of other places organically discovered the Temporal technology and immediately started using it for their mission critical workloads.</p><p>We have a strong belief that an infrastructure technology of this magnitude needs to built as an Open-source project.  This led both Maxim and I to quit our jobs at Uber and launch <a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal Technologies</a> in October 2019.  Over the last year we made huge advances with our developer experience and released <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal</a> as an Open Source Software under <a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT license</a>.  We recently launched our first production release of <a href="https://docs.temporal.io/blog/temporal-v1-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal v1.0.0</a> which is already being used by numerous companies for critical workloads.</p><p><a href="https://temporal.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://temporal.io</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/temporalio/temporal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/temporalio/temporal</a></p></section></div>]]>

And our users have the ability to generate these reports, on demand, from our tool.</p><p>As you may imagine, it can sometimes take several minutes or more to compile this much data, and waiting around looking at a loading animation while our report service crunches numbers in the background wouldn’t be a great user experience.</p><p>Instead, we needed a way to check when the report service was done generating a report, without blocking a user from doing other work in our application while that was going on. We needed <strong>polling</strong>.</p><p>Sometimes when building web applications, you’re going to need to keep track of data being created or updated asynchronously by another service. Polling, is one way to accomplish this, and all it is, is simply hitting an API’s endpoint to retrieve any new data at a set interval of time.</p><p>This is exactly the type of solution my team needed to implement — a way to periodically keep checking if the reports (being generated by our separate report service) were done, so they could be displayed in the UI for our users to download once they were. And we needed a solution that would work for React.</p><p>Today, I’ll be sharing how easy it is to leverage a custom React Hook called <code>useInterval</code>, to poll an API within your application for fresh data (or really run any task that needs intervals).</p><h2 id="polling-vs-webhooks">Polling VS Webhooks</h2><p>An alternative to polling is webhooks. Webhooks are a common way for one app to notify of an event, in real-time, to another app.</p><p>Webhooks are often referred to as “reverse APIs” because the app consuming the data does not do so by sending an HTTP request to another API — instead, it makes an API available for the app sending the data (usually, a POST HTTP request).</p><h3 id="example-getting-notified-when-a-new-component-is-available">Example: Getting notified when a new component is available</h3><p>Let’s say one of your teammates has published a component to your shared component collection. You might want to use it in your current project but how would you know that it’s now available?</p><p>One way would be by polling. </p><p>Another, more elegant and efficient way, would be by using <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/introducing-bit-dev-webhooks-78dade77c6da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">webhooks</a>.</p><hr><p>Why am I telling you about webhooks in a post about polling? Well, it’s something to keep in mind when you’re building a solution for a problem that’s potentially solved by both techniques. It may very well be that you don’t actually have an option and polling is the only available solution but if that’s not the case, you should at least consider webhooks.</p><h2 id="intervals-from-react-classes-to-react-hooks">Intervals from React Classes to React Hooks</h2><p>Before I dive into the custom useInterval Hook, let me briefly review how polling at intervals used to work in React when we could only use class-based components to work with our state.</p><h3 id="setinterval-the-old-way-to-poll-in-react-classes">SetInterval: The Old Way to Poll in React Classes</h3><p>Back in the days when we used to be restricted to class-based components for state changes, polling was typically started on the <code>componentDidMount()</code> lifecycle method as soon as the component was mounted in the DOM. And as long as the component stayed mounted, the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>setInterval()</code></a> function would continue indefinitely. Upon unmounting the component with <code>componentWillUnmount()</code>, the interval will be cleared and stop running with <code>clearInterval()</code>. Here’s an example of that code below.</p><p><code>PollingSample.js</code></p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/ef90ba3421b77b0c451dfc783ca3f15e/c701c/c95e598281bb4994840116dd477da69f.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/ef90ba3421b77b0c451dfc783ca3f15e/c701c/c95e598281bb4994840116dd477da69f.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" alt="how-polling-intervals-used-to-work-in-React">
<em>A simple example of how polling intervals used to work in React.</em></p><p>In the example above, I just have the <code>PollingExample</code>’s <code>pollingCount</code> state updating every 3 seconds, as determined by the <code>delay</code>, which is currently set to 3000ms.</p><p>When the component mounts, the <code>setInterval()</code> starts running, and every 3 seconds it increments the <code>pollingCount</code>’s state by 1 by calling the <code>tick()</code> function, which actually updates the state. Once the <code>PollingExample</code> component unmounts from the DOM, the <code>clearInterval()</code> function is called and the interval stops running.</p><p>This works fine, but if multiple components need intervals to poll for different data or execute other tasks on an interval, there can be a lot of redundant, interval-related code scattered among the components.</p><p>Setting up a running interval is pretty simple, but now that we’ve got React Hooks there’s an even simpler, cleaner way to encapsulate polling data into a custom Hook.</p><h3 id="useinterval-the-new-way-to-poll-with-react-hooks">UseInterval: The New Way to Poll with React Hooks</h3><p>When React Hooks first came out, people were critical that <code>setInterval()</code> didn’t work with Hooks the way that it had with React’s class-based components.</p><p>And it’s true, it doesn’t. Dan Abramov <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wrote</a> a very in-depth explanation of why this is the case (and does a fantastic job of explaining it, so I’ll continue to leave that to him). But in addition to demystifying how <code>setInterval()</code> works with React’s lifecycles like <code>componentDidMount()</code>, he also introduced the new Hooks-way of correctly writing intervals to work in function-based React components.</p><p>He introduced a new custom hook called <code>useInterval</code>, and it’s awesome, easy to use, and just what my team needed. Here’s the code for the Hook, taken just as Dan <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">wrote</a> it, and added right to my team’s project in our <code>hooks/</code> folder. </p><h4 id="the-useinterval-hook">The useInterval Hook</h4><p><code>useInterval.js</code></p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/6bb0379278471006e25a860d99261ad3/e5c06/c7c61f06e1e349e693d757f736bea88f.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/6bb0379278471006e25a860d99261ad3/e5c06/c7c61f06e1e349e693d757f736bea88f.png 826w" sizes="(max-width: 826px) 100vw, 826px" alt="custom-interval-hook">
<em>The code for the custom useInterval Hook, just as Dan Abramov wrote it.</em></p><p>This <code>useInterval</code> Hook sets up an interval and clears it after the component unmounts. It’s a combo of <code>setInterval()</code> and <code>clearInterval()</code>, but all wrapped into one easy-to-implement Hook.</p><p>All you need to do to get the Hook to work is supply it a function (the <code>callback</code> parameter) and an interval time (the <code>delay</code>). Simple!</p><p>With this Hook, more than half the battle is already over, now you’re ready to drop this interval Hook wherever you need it in your code. For me and my team, that happened to be in the reports page.</p><h4 id="putting-useinterval-to-use">Putting useInterval to Use</h4><p><code>ReportsPage.js</code></p><p>Here’s a condensed version of my <code>ReportsPage</code> functional component with the <code>useInterval</code> Hook imported at the top of the component and dropped into the code.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/e5942f330c84e075c8c9e908880748c9/c701c/639e6f862e4240f99d37ada6247c6b7d.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/e5942f330c84e075c8c9e908880748c9/c701c/639e6f862e4240f99d37ada6247c6b7d.png 875w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" alt="useInterval-hook-encapsulates-interval-logic">
<em>Instead of managing multiple component lifecycles, the useInterval hook encapsulates all the interval logic into itself, making it easy to reuse in many places in the code.</em></p><p>In my component, the <code>useInterval</code> Hook takes in an asynchronous call to fetch any reports that have been generated the by the report service (<code>reportService.getGeneratedReports()</code>), and then it updates the reports available for download in the UI with <code>setReports()</code>.</p><p>For ease-of-updating the interval timing if need be, I’m using a constant called <code>REPORT_REFRESH_INTERVAL</code>, which is set to run this polling interval every 15 seconds while the component is mounted.</p><p>I added the <code>console.log</code> so it’s easier to tell if the interval is running correctly.</p><p><img tabindex="0" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.asayer.io/static/bf083fe2c578ff404a0eafced6e6d625/70ccf/c88df671416244f3b56c8ae23ae8cfad.png" srcset="https://blog.asayer.io/static/bf083fe2c578ff404a0eafced6e6d625/70ccf/c88df671416244f3b56c8ae23ae8cfad.png 650w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" alt="confirms-running-on-an-interval">
<em>Inelegant? Maybe. Confirms it’s running on an interval? Sure does.</em></p><p>The count of 11 ahead of the logged message <code>"Checking if reports are ready to download"</code> demonstrates that the <code>useInterval</code> Hook is firing at regular intervals while users are on the Report page. If you checked the Network panel right now in the Developer Tools, you’d also see 11 individual API calls to the <code>reportService</code>’s <code>getGeneratedReports()</code> REST endpoint.</p><p>Once the user navigates to a different page or component, you’ll see the API calls cease with no extra code on my part. Only if the user returns to the Reports page will the polling for reports resume.</p><p>How simple is that? Instead of having to write multiple instances of <code>setInterval()</code>, <code>clearInterval()</code> inside of your class-based components’ lifecycles when you need intervals, you can have one <code>useInterval</code> Hook that can drop into any functional component anywhere in the app that you need polling.</p><p>Now that’s how you poll efficiently with a custom React Hook. And you could use this very same Hook anywhere in your code that an interval is needed.</p><hr><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Sometimes you need a simple way to check if an asynchronous task being performed by a separate service is done or not. Polling is one way to do this; hitting an endpoint over and over at some set interval to check for fresh data to display in the UI.</p><p>With the introduction of React Hooks, and especially the ability to put together custom Hooks, creating a reusable Hook called <code>useInterval</code> to serve just such a purpose seemed inevitable. Dan Abramov, part of the React core team, obliged, and the real beauty of it is, this Hook is highly reusable. It can be dropped anywhere in the app, to run any sort of task, at any interval with next to no effort. That’s the kind of solution I like.</p><p>Check back in a few weeks — I’ll be writing more about JavaScript, React, ES6, or something else related to web development.</p><p>Thanks for reading. If you need intervals in your React app and you’re using Hooks, consider adding this <code>useInterval</code> Hook to your arsenal, it’s a cinch to use and easy to customize to your specific needs.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/polling-in-react-using-the-useinterval-custom-hook-e2bcefda4197" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">original article</a> or more interesting posts on <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/@paigen11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Paige</a>’s blog.</p><h2 id="if-you-enjoyed-reading-this-you-may-also-enjoy-some-of-my-other-free-pieces">If you enjoyed reading this, you may also enjoy some of my other free pieces:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/animating-reactjs-with-react-transition-group-2af6c87cab0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Animating React with React Transition Group”</a></li><li><a href="https://itnext.io/javascripts-optional-chaining-proposal-bc9e6e5f2877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“JavaScript’s Optional Chaining Proposal”</a></li><li><a href="https://itnext.io/destructuring-arrays-objects-javascript-es6-feature-series-pt-10-507108471c07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Destructuring Arrays &amp; Objects: JavaScript ES6 Feature Series (Pt 10)”</a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="references-and-further-resources">References and Further Resources</h3><ul><li>Dan Abramov’s blog post on Overreacted <a href="https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">“Making setInterval Declarative with React Hooks”</a></li></ul><h2 id="frontend-monitoring">Frontend Monitoring</h2><p><a href="https://asayer.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Asayer</a> is a frontend monitoring tool that replays everything your users do and shows how your web app behaves for every issue.

          <h2 id="a-changing-industry">A changing industry</h2><p>These are interesting times for Real Estate. </p><p>“Uncertainty” has become the mantra for industry analysts when asked what will happen in the coming months following the wake of a pandemic-fueled economic crisis. Nobody knows when or how the “new normal” is going to hit them. Yet, as tenants pause leasing decisions and implement work-from-home strategies, some CRE companies are preparing to fight back.</p><p>As this <a href="https://www.avisonyoung.com/documents/20342/571064/COVID-19+-+Evaluating+the+New+Normal+in+Commercial+Real+Estate/c4c3df5d-6f20-4c4f-941f-6ce6a955d3d6">Avison Young report</a> states, the return to normalcy will likely occur in stages for many real estate branches. While some firms are confident that a return to the office is certain, others are doubling down on efforts in their innovation programs to ensure the new home-based agents have the right tools to navigate their work. These efforts aren’t simply focused on the current crisis, but on what comes <em>next</em> in the digital future.<br></p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/develop-commercial-RE-app-1-2.png" alt="Property type and lease terminations - nar.realtor"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-market-recovery-survey-07-09-2020.pdf">nar.realtor</a></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the future, the words of a recent <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2020/08/19/why-cre-companies-need-to-be-at-the-forefront-of-technology/#7267d3a158e7">Forbes</a> article seem to be carrying weight: </p><blockquote>The time has come for CRE to be at the forefront of technology. </blockquote><p>But how do you even begin to take up that challenge? “We’re a real estate company, not a tech company,” you might say. While it may <em>seem</em> contrary to your mission, I assure you it is not. Now more than ever I’m hearing companies refer to themselves as, “tech companies that specialize in [insert industry here].” This is the mindset that will help you adapt for the future while delivering the value and guidance your clients expect.</p><p>Building an application can be a first step in the right direction.</p><h2 id="how-can-a-software-application-help">How can a software application help?</h2><p>Whether you work on the commercial or residential side of things, there are common problems you’ll face when it comes to building an app for your users. Just like solutions for the financial or insurance industries, real estate apps have to be simple and intuitive for your user. Whether the users are internal or external, they must be able to quickly understand the app, connect with the trusted third-party databases your company uses, and provide bullet-proof security layers for handling sensitive data.</p><h3 id="facilitating-the-buying-experience">Facilitating the buying experience</h3><p><em>Building with the customer in mind</em></p><p>In today’s crowded market, valuations and listings are not enough for your prospective buyers. </p><ul><li><strong>Capital market investors</strong> need to have as much real time data as possible about the property they put their eyes on. Understanding which availabilities in the market fit their risk criteria, the building age, and ROI of the property are just a few key insights that are expected when making a decision. Not being able to physically visit and tour their locations adds further complexity to the current sale/lease process. </li><li><strong>Potential tenants</strong> want to have comprehensive info about current lease expiration dates, the history of the building, and the previous occupants. With the buying experience increasingly going virtual, in-person tours have become pretty limited. Clients are becoming more untrusting of face-to-face interactions and, in turn, they’re showing preference to companies that can bring the property touring experience into their phone &amp; computer screens.</li></ul><p>From touring to closing the deal, enabling the digital experience for tenants and investors <a href="https://www.us.jll.com/en/views/technology-adoption-in-commercial-real-estate">has been proven to make a difference</a> for many companies. It will continue to do so long after this pandemic is behind us.</p><h3 id="facilitating-the-selling-experience">Facilitating the selling experience</h3><p><em>Building with the employee in mind</em></p><p>On the other side of the coin, you need to enable your workforce now more than ever. Brokers are struggling with the demands on them to rapidly provide insights to their tenants and landlords. Demonstrating that they can provide unparalleled guidance by leveraging tech will save both the brokers and the buyers time and energy. Both parties will be grateful for it. The office space is already seeing a decrease in demand for square footage as work-from-home tenants push to reduce their exposure and spaces are being reconfigured (and downsized). Being able to offer alternatives by rapidly filtering buildings by attributes like these is key:</p><ul><li>amount of available square feet</li><li>property age</li><li>neighborhood demographics</li><li>previously viewed spaces that may not have worked before</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2020/04/21/how-commercial-real-estate-brokers-and-office-users-will-adapt-to-the-new-future/#1a82a40035f4">Tools that enable</a> your commercial sales force need to take into account this new reality. Realistic renderings of what the finished space may look like, virtual tours, 3D floor plans, space planning tools that are quickly customizable to the tenant’s needs, and easy access to a lawyer and notary if a deal is to be completed are all a few examples. These tools have progressed from just being ‘perks’ to becoming the business itself.<br></p><figure><img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/develop-commercial-RE-app-1-1.png" alt="Do you expect the demand for technologies to increase, decrease, or stay the same?"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2020-market-recovery-survey-07-09-2020.pdf">nar.realtor</a></figcaption></figure><p>Part of this enablement is making sure both parties have the right building information at the right time.

This ensures that you're feeding them with top-notched market information while also differentiating yourself from every other player out there.</li><li><strong>Data abstraction.</strong> By leveraging machine learning, you can run through physical docs like leases, renewals, mortgages, liens, and regulatory actions to digitize the data gathering processes. Getting ahead in the game by eliminating a heavy paperwork process is key. <a href="https://www.altusgroup.com/argus/resources/insights/cre-innovation-report-2020">75% of CRE executives said automation will lead to the elimination of jobs</a>, but also that this shift will cause an <em>increase</em> in new, higher value positions that hadn’t existed previously. We all know lease documents can be extremely lengthy and complex. By choosing a data abstraction partner, you can streamline your lease/compliance process by building a software that runs thousands of files in seconds, extracting key data points from physical documents, and saving hundreds of hours of manual work. </li><li><strong>GIS, analytics, data visualization</strong>. <a href="https://codelitt.com/blackbird">Having a GPS map view of your properties</a> and areas for potential investment was a no brainer. After Covid-19 struck, many CTOs deprioritized this in lieu of mobile operability as most of the agents are doing their jobs online.

Usability is the deciding factor. In real estate, the stakes are high. Buying or selling a property can be the decision of a lifetime for many investors, which is why you have to make sure that your platform is <a href="https://blog.codelitt.com/journey-to-ux/">clear, intuitive, and built with all your users in mind</a>. Users with little technical or financial knowledge should be able to find their way around your app easily.

				<p>Today, network address translators are everywhere. Their ubiquitous adoption was promoted neither by design nor by planning but by the continued growth of the Internet, which brings forth an ever-increasing demand not only on IP address space but also on other functional requirements that network address translation (NAT) is perceived to facilitate. This article provides a personal perspective on the history of NAT, the lessons we may learn from it, and some articulations on best ways forward from where we are today.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>NAT commonly refers to a box that interconnects a local network to the public Internet, where the local network runs on a block of private IPv4 addresses as specified in RFC 1918. In the original Internet architecture design, each IP address is defined to be globally unique and globally reachable. In contrast, a private IPv4 address is meaningful only within the scope of the local network behind a NAT and, as such, the same private address block can be reused in multiple local networks, as long as those networks do not directly talk to each other. Instead, they communicate with each other-and with the rest of Internet-through NAT boxes.</p>
<p>Like most unexpected successes, NAT’s ubiquitous adoption was not foreseen when the idea first emerged more than 15 years ago (RFC 1287 and RFC 1335). Back then, had anyone foreseen where NAT would be today, it is possible that the NAT deployment itself might have followed a different path: one that was better planned and standardised. The set of Internet protocols that have developed over the past 15 years might have also evolved differently, and we might have seen less overall complexity in the Internet than what we have today.</p>
<p>Although the clock cannot be turned back, I believe it’s a worth-while exercise to revisit the history of NAT so that we may learn some useful lessons. It may also be worthwhile to assess-or reassess-the pros and cons of NAT, as well as to take a look at where we are today in our handling of NAT and how best to proceed into the future.</p>
<p>I would like to emphasise that this writing represents a personal view, and my recall of history is likely to be incomplete and to contain errors. My personal view on this subject has also changed substantially over time, and it may continue to evolve, as we are all in a continuing process of understanding this fascinating and dynamically changing Internet.</p>
<p><strong>How NAT Works</strong></p>

<em>Lixia Zhang and Tony Li at IETF 69 in Chicago</em></p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, IP addresses were designed to be globally unique and globally reachable. This property of the IP address is a fundamental building block in supporting the Internet’s end-to-end architecture. Until very recently, almost all of the Internet protocol designs, especially those below the application layer, have been based on the aforementioned IP address model. However, the explosive growth of the Internet in early 1990s not only signalled the danger of IP address space exhaustion but also created an instant demand on the IP addresses: suddenly, connecting large numbers of user networks and home computers demanded IP addresses instantly and in large quantity. Such demand could not possibly be met by going through the regular IP address allocation process. NAT came into play to meet that instant high demand.</p>
<p>Because NAT was not standardised before its wide deployment, a number of different NAT products exist today, each with somewhat different functionality and different technical details. Since this article is about the history of NAT deployment-and not an explanation of how to traverse specific NAT boxes-I will describe a popular NAT implementation as an illustrative example. Interested readers may visit Wikipedia to find out more about various NAT products.</p>
<p>A NAT box <strong>N</strong> has a public IP address for its interface connecting to the global Internet and a private address facing the internal network. N serves as the default router for all of the destinations that are outside the local NAT address block. When internal host <strong>H</strong> sends an IP packet <strong>P</strong> to a public IP destination address <strong>D</strong> in the global Internet, the packet will be routed to <strong>N. N</strong> translates the private source IP address in <strong>P</strong>‘s header to its public IP address and adds an entry to its internal table that keeps track of the mapping between the internal host and the outgoing packet. This entry represents a piece of state, which enables all subsequent packet exchanges between <strong>H</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. For example, when <strong>D</strong> sends a packet <strong>P’</strong> in response to <strong>P, P’</strong> will arrive at N, and N can find the corresponding entry from its mapping table and replace the destination IP address-which is its own public IP address-with the real destination address <strong>H</strong>, so that <strong>P’</strong> will be delivered to <strong>H</strong>. This mapping entry times out after a certain period of idleness, which is normally set to a vendor-specific value. In the process of changing the IP address carried in the IP header of each passing packet, a NAT box must also recalculate the IP header checksum-as well as the transport protocol’s checksum-if it is calculated based on the IP address, as in the cases for TCP and UDP check-sums.</p>
<p>From this description, it is easy to see the major benefit of NAT: one can connect a large number of hosts to the global Internet by using a single public IP address. Other benefits of NAT also became clear over time, as discussed in more detail later.</p>
<p>At the same time, a number of NAT’s drawbacks can also be identified immediately. First and foremost, NAT changed the end-to-end communication model of the Internet architecture in a fundamental way: Instead of allowing any host to talk directly to any other host on the Internet, hosts behind a NAT now must go through the NAT to reach others, and all communications through a NAT box can be initiated only by an internal host first in order to set up the mapping entries. In addition, since ongoing data exchange depends on the mapping entry kept at the NAT box, the box represents a single point of failure: if the NAT box crashes, it may lose all of the existing state, and the data exchange between all of the internal and external hosts will have to be restarted. This is in contrast to the original IP’s goal of delivering packets to their destinations as long as any physical connectivity exists between the source and destination. Furthermore, because NAT alters the IP addresses carried in a packet, all protocols that are dependent on IP addresses are affected. In certain cases, such as TCP checksum, which includes IP addresses in the calculation, the NAT box can hide the address change by recalculating the TCP checksum when forwarding a packet. For some of the other protocols that make direct use of IP addresses, such as IPSec, the protocols can no longer operate on the end-to-end basis as originally designed; for some application protocols that embed IP addresses in the application data, application-level gateways are needed to handle the IP address rewrite. As discussed later, NAT also introduced some other drawbacks that surfaced only recently.</p>
<p><strong>A Recall of NAT History</strong></p>
<p>I started graduate school at Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work on network research at the same time as RFC 791, the Internet Protocol Specification, was published in September 1981. Thus I was fortunate to witness the most fascinating unfolding of this new system called the Internet. During the next 10 years, the Internet grew rapidly. RFC 1287, Towards the Future Internet Architecture, was published in 1991 and is probably the first RFC that raised the concern about IP address space exhaustion in a foreseeable future.</p>
<p>RFC 1287 also discussed three possible directions for extending IP address space. The first one pointed to a direction similar to today’s NAT:</p>
<p>Replace the 32 bit field with a feld of the same size but with different meaning. Instead of being globally unique, it would now be unique only within some smaller region …</p>
<p>RFC 1335, published in May 1992, provides a more elaborate description of the use of internal IP addresses (in other words, private IP addresses) as a solution to IP address exhaustion. The first paper describing the NAT idea, “Extending the IP Internet Through Address Reuse,” appeared in the January 1993 issue of Computer Communication Review and was published a year later as RFC 1663. Although these RFCs may be considered forerunners in the development of NAT, as explained later, for various reasons the IETF did not take actions to standardise NAT.</p>
<p>The invention of the Web further accelerated Internet growth in the early 1990s. The explosive growth underlined the urgency to take action toward solving both the routing scalability and the address shortage problems. The IETF took several follow-up steps, which eventually led to the launch of the IPng development effort. I believe the expectation at the time was to get a new IP developed within a few years, followed by a quick deployment. However, the actual deployment during the next 10 years took a rather unexpected path.</p>
<p><strong>The planned solution</strong></p>
<p>As pointed out in RFC 1287, the continued growth of the Internet exposed strains in the Internet architecture as originally designed, the two most urgent of which were routing system scalability and exhaustion of IP address space. Since long-term solutions require a long lead time to develop and deploy, efforts started on developing both a short-term solution and a longterm solution to those problems.</p>
<p>Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR, was proposed as a shortterm solution. CIDR removed the class boundaries embedded in the IP address structure, thus enabling more efficient address allocation, which helped extend the lifetime of IP address space. CIDR also facilitated routing aggregation, which slowed the growth of the routing table. However, as stated in RFC 1481, IAB Recommendation for an Intermediate Strategy to Address the Issue of Scaling, “This strategy (CIDR) presumes that a suitable longterm solution is being …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- s9ymdb:496 --><p><img width="300" height="303" src="https://blog.hboeck.de/uploads/bluebutton.jpg" alt="Blue Button">BigBlueButton is a free web-based video conferencing software that lately got quite popular, largely due to Covid-19. Earlier this year I did a brief check on its security which led to an <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/big-blue-button-das-grosse-blaue-sicherheitsrisiko-2010-151610.html">article on Golem.de (German)</a>. I want to share the most significant findings here.</p><p>

BigBlueButton has a feature that lets a presenter upload a presentation in a wide variety of file formats that gets then displayed in the web application. This looked like a huge attack surface. The conversion for many file formats is done with Libreoffice on the server. Looking for ways to exploit server-side Libreoffice rendering I found a <a href="https://buer.haus/2019/10/18/a-tale-of-exploitation-in-spreadsheet-file-conversions/">blog post by Bret Buerhaus</a> that discussed a number of ways of exploiting such setups.</p><p>

One of the methods described there is a feature in Opendocument Text (ODT) files that allows embedding a file from an external URL in a text section. This can be a web URL like https or a file url and include a local file.</p><p>

This directly worked in BigBlueButton. An ODT file that referenced a local file would display that local file. This allows displaying any file that the user running the BigBlueButton service could access on the server. A possible way to exploit this is to exfiltrate the configuration file that contains the API secret key, which then allows basically controlling the BigBlueButton instance. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op2hc2Z56a8">video showing the exploit here</a>. (I will publish the exploit later.)</p><p>

I reported this to the developers of BigBlueButton in May. Unfortunately my experience with their security process was not very good. At first I did not get an answer at all. After another mail they told me they plan to sandbox the Libreoffice process either via a chroot or a docker container. However that still has not happened yet. It is planned for the upcoming version 2.3 and independent of this bug this is a good idea, as Libreoffice just creates a lot of attack surface.</p><p>

Recently I looked a bit more into this.  The functionality to include external files only happens after a manual user confirmation and if one uses Libreoffice on the command line it does not work at all by default. So in theory this exploit should not have worked, but it did.</p><p>

It turned out the reason for this was another piece of software that BigBlueButton uses called <a herf="https://github.com/sbraconnier/jodconverter">JODConverter</a>. It provides a wrapper around the conversion functionality of Libreoffice. After contacting both the Libreoffice security team and the developer of JODConverter we figured out that it enables including external URLs by default.</p><p>

I forwarded this information to the BigBlueButton developers and it finally let to a fix, they now change the default settings of JODConverter manually. The JODConverter developer considers changing the default as well, but this has not happened yet. Other software or web pages using JODConverter for serverside file conversion may thus still be vulnerable.</p><p>

The fix was included in version 2.2.27. Today I learned that the company RedTeam Pentesting <a href="https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2020-005/-arbitrary-file-disclosure-and-server-side-request-forgery-in-bigbluebutton">has later independently found the same vulnerability</a>. They also requested a CVE: It is now filed as CVE-2020-25820.</p><p>

While this issue is fixed, the handling of security issues by BigBlueButton was not exactly stellar. It took around five months from my initial report to a fix. The <a href="https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.2.27">release notes</a> do not mention that this is an important security update (the change has the note “speed up the conversion”).</p><p>

I found a bunch of other security issues in BigBlueButton and proposed some hardening changes. This took a lot of back and forth, but all significant issues are resolved now.</p><p>

Another issue with the presentation upload was that it allowed cross site scripting, because it did not set a proper content type for downloads. This was independently discovered by another person and was fixed a while ago. (If you are interested in details about this class of vulnerabilities: I have given <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t8JYpt0egE">a talk about it at last year’s Security Fest</a>.)</p><p>

The session Cookies both from BigBlueButton itself and from its default web frontend Greenlight were not set with a secure flag, so the cookies could be transmitted in clear text over the network. This has also been changed now.</p><p>

By default the BigBlueButton installation script starts several services that open ports that do not need to be publicly accessible. This is now also changed. A freeswitch service run locally was installed with a default password (“ClueCon”), this is now also changed to a random password by the installation script.</p><p>

What also looks quite problematic is the use of outdated software. BigBlueButton only works on Ubuntu 16.04, which is a long term support version, so it still receives updates. But it also uses several external repositories, including one that installs NodeJS version 8 and shows a warning that this repository no longer receives security updates. There is an <a href="https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bbb-install/issues/109">open bug in the bug tracker</a>.</p><p>

If you are using BigBlueButton I strongly recommend you update to at least version 2.2.27. This should fix all the issues I found. I would wish that the BigBlueButton developers improve their security process, react more timely to external reports and more transparent when issues are fixed.</p><p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In late April, as coronavirus shutdowns across the US caused millions to lose their jobs overnight, the food security system imploded. Viral photos on social media showed massive food bank lines wrapped around city blocks and it seemed like the food supply chain was at risk of collapsing. It was around that time that <a href="https://twitter.com/ericries" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eric Ries</a> reached out to a small group including myself, <a href="https://twitter.com/jwmares" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Justin Mares</a>, and <a href="https://www.jeffnobbs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jeff Nobbs</a> to see if we could help him come up with a model to feed the people excluded from the existing food security system.</p>
<p>Together, we thought of an idea that could simultaneously help both those experiencing hunger and the restaurants facing unprecedented economic disruption. By building a lightweight tech solution, we could connect those who needed meals with restaurants that had the need for customers as COVID-19 evaporated their customer base. We’d fund the meals on the back end, through donations. </p>
<p>We started small (insert lean startup joke), and our V1 was a no-code Twilio bot that asked the person texting it a few questions to figure out location, how many meals they needed, and their first name. The bot deposited those requests into Airtable, where we could manually match them with a restaurant. We used an Airtable block to send out Twilio SMS messages right from our spreadsheet — and gave restaurants a read-only view of their "database" where they could see the orders we’d matched with them. Once a meal was picked up, the restaurant could click a link in the table, which would trigger a Zapier workflow to mark the meal as fulfilled.</p>
<p>Once this was ready to test, Jeff handed out the Twilio number via flyers to those at the back of the foodbank lines in SF. As hundreds of requests started flowing in, we validated the technology and were amazed to see just how high the demand was for a service like this — another kind of validation as we moved forward.</p>

   Version 1 of our bot in Twilio Studio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A week later, we hit our first limit: We didn't have the human bandwidth to match the number of hungry families texting us. We could reasonably text and support 300-400 families a day, and the pick-up process was seamless. However, if more than 400 texts came in, our system broke down. As we added more restaurants in more neighborhoods, we began working on an automated solution. </p>
<p>One of our developer volunteers, <a href="https://twitter.com/jhdielman" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jason Dielman</a> of Twilio, started working on a Javascript-based algorithm that could plug directly into our Studio workflow via Twilio functions, allowing a lambda function to automatically match and direct people to their matched provider.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we needed a stopgap to handle our growing number of requests. I reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidHead" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">David Head</a>, who, the last time I saw him, was running one of the most complex Google sheets I imagined existed. He jumped in and within a few days, built a Google Sheet matchmaker that could automatically assign users to matched restaurants. We kept it simple by always matching for the following day, and instead of collecting location, we asked those texting which neighborhoods they could most easily access. After testing, we launched and quickly saw our daily meals reach 1,000 meals served per day. It worked!</p>
<p>With a stable product able to meet the current need, we shifted our focus to building an overall more reliable service that could scale to other cities, as well as balance capacity across our network of restaurants. Jeff was building out an impressive operations effort with our restaurant partners, working with owners to get our cost per meal down from $10 on average to just above $7. As Eric and Justin worked on raising our first funds and putting that money to use, we needed to define a growth path that allowed us to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p>In a Slack team, we assembled an amazing group of volunteer developers. <a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">USDR</a> connected us with <a href="https://twitter.com/wgyn_" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ryan Wang</a>, who wrote code to get user feedback, as well as "remember" repeat users to avoid collecting their details each time they text. Through Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTomMonks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tom Monks</a> joined up and helped us build functions to track our statistics and user inputs. Meanwhile, Jason and I plugged away at the automated system.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, we went live with V2, which we’re still running today. The new bot ensured that we could now handle thousands of requests per day. In San Francisco, we hit a new milestone: serving 20,000 meals in one week. </p>
<p>Here’s how V2 works:</p>
<p>When a user texts our number, we first run a number of checks. The first is to see what language they speak. We use keywords to identify language, as the bot is fluent in English, Spanish, and Chinese. We then check if they’ve texted before, and if not, ask a few intake questions to best match them.</p>
<p>We then take their family size and zip code and run that through our meal-matching algorithm. Jason built an algorithm to balance restaurant capacity so that we can make sure we give each restaurant a consistent flow of meals per day. This is important for our provider owners, who use that consistency to avoid layoffs and keep their kitchens running. </p>
<p>The algorithm uses the Google Distance Matrix API to find the restaurants that have "balanced capacity" closest to our family in need. We then text back that family with three different pick-up options based on time and location. Now, we can match meals up to 3 days in advance. This way, if there isn’t a meal available in their neighborhood until tomorrow, they have the option to travel a bit farther to get a hot meal today. </p>
<p>Once they’re matched, we send over the name and address of the restaurant and a pickup window to get their meal. One of the most important pieces of this entire process for us is that the pickup process is as dignified as possible. We want all of our users to be able to walk into a restaurant and pick up a meal just like they would with a normal takeout order.</p>
<p>A few hours after the meal has been picked up, we send out a request for feedback. Ryan built out a function to collect a 1-5 star rating and a space for our users to comment on their experience, which then goes right back into the restaurant’s dashboard. We get to see what’s working on our end, and the restaurants get to improve their experience as well. </p>

<p>Now that we’ve served over 175,000 meals in San Francisco and Detroit and we’re looking for more ways to help improve this model and bring it to other cities. If you’d like to help out in any way, including sharing ideas for V3, please visit our website at <a href="http://helpkitchen.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">HelpKitchen.org</a> and use the contact form there. </p>
<p>I know there’s a stigma in Silicon Valley about "tech people jumping in to solve a problem that’s already been solved" — but in the case of COVID, I’ve been blown away at the amount of good work being done in tech right now. We can only overcome this urgent crisis if we all come together and put the needs of our communities first. We must think deeply about the tools, ideas, and access we have as individuals and make the choice to prioritize our creative and technical energy to do good. Creating HelpKitchen has shown us how quickly an idea can become a lifeline for thousands of people. We’re proud of what we’ve created and we’re humbled to see its impact after just four months. There is still much to do, and we couldn't have accomplished any of this with the many people who have opened doors and supported us along the way. </p>
<h6>Why it failed</h6>
<p>While this article was linked to in Eric Reis's <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2020/08/its-time-for-lean-philanthropy-case.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the project, it never built momentum on its own. Mostly my fault, I got lazy and didn't share it with the more technical communities that would likely be interested. Obviously even though the article failed, the project is overall a success :) </p></div></div>]]>

      <p>A look at how LinkedIn exfiltrates browser extension data from your browser.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>How would you feel if you opened a program and the program started to check your file system to see what other programs you
      had installed? You would probably feel the software was overstepping. This is essentially what LinkedIn does when you visit their
      website. LinkedIn will scan your local browser files in an attempt to identify a number of different browser extensions you may
      have installed. The data collected by LinkedIn is then exfiltrated from the browser.</p>
      <p>
        This whole adventure started when I was browsing LinkedIn and happened to have my browser console open. While on my LinkedIn
        profile I noticed a large number of 404 errors and as a developer it piqued my interest.
        <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/spying-xs.gif" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
          <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/spying-xs.gif" alt="LinkedIn's website making local host web requests.">
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>What really piqued my curiosity was the fact all of these failed web requests were for <strong>chrome-extension://</strong>
      resources. After inspecting a few of the extension IDs in the resources I began to suspect LinkedIn was attempting to determine
      if I had certain extensions installed by executing local web requests to the browser itself.</p>
      <p>I spent some time toying around with my browser and LinkedIn's assets. Note, reverse engineering LinkedIn's source code is
      apparently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#dos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">against their terms of service</a>. If I was
      LinkedIn I would probably not want people figuring out how I spy on them either.</p>
      <p>After poking around and doing some investigation I found an interesting object in one of LinkedIn's local storage values.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>

      <p>One of LinkedIn's local storage keys is <strong>C_C_M</strong>. The value itself is a base64 encoded string (which isn't too
      abnormal). However, if you decode the string you will see a large JSON blob that seems to be encoded with unicode code points (not
      human readable).</p>
      <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/unicode-resized.png" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
        <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/unicode-resized.png" alt="LinkedIn's local storage printed to a browser console encoded with unicode.">
      </a>
      <p>I am not too sure how or why they encoded it that way, but it seems to me like it was in an attempt to obfuscate the data. The
      encoding is easy enough to reverse, simply parse the JSON. You can do it yourself with the following snippet:</p>
      <p><code>JSON.parse(atob(localStorage.getItem("C_C_M")));</code></p>
      <p>Doing so will display a large JavaScript object with some interesting data in it. Note, it appears the data held in this JSON
      blob is personalized to some degree. In other words, my JSON blob may be larger or smaller than yours. I am unsure which heuristic
      LinkedIn uses to determine which extensions to scan for but they must be using some. Curious what the complete JSON object looks
      like? <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/files/linkedin-extension.json" target="_blank">Here's mine</a>.</p>
      <a href="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/localstorage.png" target="blank" rel="nopener noreferrer">
        <img src="https://prophitt.me/assets/images/localstorage.png" alt="LinkedIn's local storage printed to the console as a javascript object.">
      </a>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>After examing the JSON file it became pretty clear what was going on. LinkedIn is using two different methods to determine if
      you have an extension installed.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Content Changed</li>
        <li>Web Accessible Resources</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The first method is the simplest. LinkedIn simply looks for certain content on the page they know doesn't belong there. For
      instance, if they find a div with the ID <strong>email-hunter</strong>, they know you have the Email Hunter extension installed
      (and now your account is probably restricted, or at least on a blacklist).</p>
      <p>The second method is a lot more interesting to me. When building an extension you can specify web accessible resources. These
      resources are typically used via a content script to build a custom interface. However, there's a bit of a gotcha. If the content
      script can make a request for the web accessible resource, so can the underlying website. LinkedIn abuses this fact and sprays
      web requests to your local browser in attempt to find extensions.</p>
      <p>I built a simple extension to automatically parse the extension file and display extensions LinkedIn is looking for.
        <a href="https://code.prophitt.me/corey/nefarious-linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check it out here</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      
      <hr>
      <p>So, as a developer of an extension what can you do about this? I recommend not using
      <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/web_accessible_resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web accessible resources</a>. Out
      of all extensions LinkedIn finds, a majority of them are due to web accessible resources.</p>
      <p>I would recommend not modifying or injecting user interface features into the underlying page. Alternatively, I would use a
      browser action and communicate with the content page through messaging passing.</p>

    </span></p><p>“I think you need to read more,” my professor told me bluntly. I’d just shared my idea for an upcoming paper, and he clearly wasn’t thrilled about it.</p><p>“Read more?” I remember thinking. I wasn’t expecting that response. I walked out of his university office trying to make sense of his comment.</p><p>So I read a lot over the next few weeks. My knowledge grew tremendously—and so did my ideas, which inspired a new and improved paper topic.</p><p>That experience, which was about a decade ago, taught me a critical lesson: the benefits of reading avidly and broadly about your field. What began as a one-time thing to do well in a class has turned into a lifetime habit.</p><p>Interestingly, I received similar advice when I began writing professionally. I was constantly told to write a lot and <em>read a lot</em>.</p><p>Given the emphasis on reading up to that point, you can imagine my shock at the attitude toward reading when I began to program. It seems to be a low priority for many people.</p><p>In the world of programming, reading includes reading code and reading technical books. I’ve written previously on <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-reading-code-matters">why reading code matters</a> and how to go about it.</p><p>Now it’s time to tackle reading technical programming books.</p><p>Reading technical programming books is one <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/3-programming-habits-to-build-now">habit programmers should begin immediately</a>. It’s a relatively small investment that’ll help you now, but will pay dividends in the future for this simple reason: your knowledge will compound over time.</p><p>The question you’re probably asking is this: why books?</p><p>After all, we spend a bulk of our days glued to the computer, where we have access to a seemingly infinite amount of material (and so much of it is free).</p><p>As a producer of online content, I realize that online articles and blog posts have their place. Blog posts can give you an interesting perspective and exposure to a new idea. A technical article or the documentation for a language or technology can answer that specific question you have.</p><p>But books have their place, too.</p><p>They fill a different need: they’re a source of long-form content that take you on an in-depth journey about a particular topic. A blog post or technical article may be a few hundred or thousand words. A book is tens of thousands.</p><p>When you pick up a technical book, you take a deep dive into said topic. You pick up the nuances. You study, practice, and learn. You get into the mindset of an industry expert. You begin to see things differently, as your context begins to grow.</p><p>There’s no shortage of topics to read about in our field:</p><ul><li>Computer architecture</li><li>Agile software development</li><li>Algorithms</li><li>Testing</li><li>Writing clean code</li><li>Refactoring</li></ul><p>The list goes on and on.</p><p>Even in the age of everything digital, it pays to begin your own library of technical material. So invest in some technical books. Use them. Write in them. Reference them as you code to help you build good habits.</p><p>The challenge, of course, is finding the time to fit something like reading into an already packed schedule.</p><p>But if people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett—who are known to be vast readers—can find time to read, I’m convinced we can, too.</p><p>Consider mathematician Richard Hamming. He, too, figured out a way to make reading a habit, which he shares in his excellent lecture, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=a1zDuOPkMSw"><em>You and Your Research</em></a>.</p><p>Hamming couldn’t understand how his colleague, mathematician John Tukey, knew so much. “The guy was clearly a genius,” Hamming recalls. So he went into his manager’s office to find out.</p><p>“Hamming,” his manager said matter of factly, “you’d be surprised how much you’d know if you worked as hard as <!-- -->[Tukey]<!-- --> did.”</p><p>Hamming reflected on his manager’s comment and decided to “reorganize” his life. He cut out “nonsense magazines” and spent time “studying things in <!-- -->[his]<!-- --> career.”</p><p>There was always a book on his coffee table “ready to be read.” He also got appointed as a book review editor, so he could review the books he read. “This way I forced myself to get a wide acquaintance in computer science,” Hamming remarked of the process.</p><p>“I wasn’t a first-class genius,” Hamming explained. “So I simply set aside those other things <!-- -->[like reading the New Yorker]<!-- --> and did that,” he added. “It’s not hard to do. You just do it.”</p><h2>What We can Learn from Hamming</h2><p>There are a few critical points we can glean from Hamming’s story.</p><p>First, he always had a book on his coffee table. In other words, he always had a book in sight. This visual sends a kind reminder to read.</p><p>If a coffee table doesn’t work for you, try keeping a programming book next to your computer or nightstand. Perhaps placing a book by your television stand is best. That way, when you reach for the remote control, you see the book you ought to be reading.</p><p>Second, becoming a book editor seemed to hold Hamming accountable both for reading and for making sense of what he read.</p><p>After writing a review, he let it sit for a week. Then, he’d ask himself these questions: “Is that a good review? Does that really digest the book?” If not, “you’re re-reading the book and writing a better review.”</p><p>In today’s world, the process is even easier: read a book and write a blog post on it. Indeed, writing is a great way to solidify your knowledge.</p><p>That's an important point: do something with the content you're reading about. Hamming chose to write reviews. But there are other ways to go about it.</p><p>While reading, use what I call the “<a href="https://amymhaddad.com/four-ways-to-learn-programming-topics">spot check</a>” approach. The idea is to randomly check your knowledge as you learn new material. After reading a paragraph or two, pause, and see if you can recall and articulate what you just learned about.</p><p>Another idea is to type some notes summarizing key points after you read a chapter. The process itself is useful to review and reinforce important points.</p><p>Then, you can use the notes you type in different ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Make <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/how-to-retain-the-programming-knowledge-you-have-gained">Anki flashcards</a></strong>, so you’ll constantly see the information in the future.</li><li><strong>Make a checklist</strong>. After getting feedback on my variable names, I read about naming in the book <em>Code Complete</em>. Then, I made a “<a href="https://amymhaddad.com/improve-your-code-by-writing-better-variable-names.mdx">variable name” checklist</a>. It hangs on the wall in front of my desk.</li><li><strong>Focus on something specific you learned about while coding</strong>. I recently read some useful information about writing tests. Now I pull up these notes and reference them as I work.</li></ul><p>The point is to apply what you’re learning. Take the information you're gaining, connect it, and turn it into knowledge.</p><p>In large part, making reading a priority is a matter of attitude.</p><p>You’ve got to realize that reading matters. And to realize that reading matters, you’ve got to see the benefits. When something is important and we see the benefits, we find a way to make it happen.</p><p>There’s an easy way to do it: start with reading only 30 minutes each day for a month. It’s a small, manageable investment of time. And yet it’s enough to have an impact.</p><p>Whenever I add something new to my life, I find it useful to cut out something else. That way, I don’t add more stress trying to fit it all in.</p><p>At the end of the month, take inventory and see how much you learned. The odds are high that you’ll be shocked by how much you learn. You’ll either find ways to continue the habit or you’ll find ways to spend even more time reading.</p><p>The professor who told me to “read more” ignited my motivation to read, albeit initially to get a good grade. But I quickly saw the benefits. As it turned out, this professor, who I later learned has over 1,000 books in his personal library, gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever received.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s a common task in NLP to either check a text against a pattern or extract parts from the text that matches a certain pattern. A regular expression or “regex” is a powerful tool to achieve this.</p>
<p>While powerful, regex can feel daunting as it comes with a lot of features and sub-parts that you need to remember.</p>
<p>In this post, I will illustrate the various concepts underlying regex. The goal is to help you build a good mental model of how a regex pattern works.</p>
<h2 id="mental-model">Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example where we are trying to find the word ‘cool’ in the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-mental-model-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With regex, we could simply type out the word ‘cool’ as the pattern and it will match the word.</p>

<p>While regex matched our desired word ‘<strong>cool</strong>’, the way it operates is not at the word level but the character level. This is the key idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Regex works at the character-level, not word-level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The implication of this is that the regex <code>r'cool'</code> would match the following sentences as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-exact-word-match.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key idea, let’s understand how we can match simple characters using regex.</p>
<h3 id="a-specific-character">a. Specific character</h3>
<p>We can simply specify the character in the regular expression and it will match all instances in the text.</p>
<p>For example, a regular expression given below will match all instances of ‘a’ in the text. You can use any of the small and capital alphabets.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-only-a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use any digits from 0 to 9 and it will work as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-python-3.7-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that regex is case-sensitive by default and thus the following regex won’t match anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-not-matched-by-capital-a.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-white-space-character">b. White space character</h3>
<p>We can detect special characters such as whitespace and newlines using special escape sequences.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-white-space-characters.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common ones above, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>\r</strong> for carriage return</li>
<li><strong>\f</strong> for form feed</li>
<li><strong>\e</strong> for escape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-special-sequences">c. Special sequences</h3>
<p>Regex provides a bunch of built-in special symbols that can match a group of characters at once. These begin with backslash <code>\</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pattern-d">Pattern: <code>\d</code></h4>
<p>It matches any single-digit number between 0 to 9.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-single-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that matches are single digit. So we have 4 different matches below instead of a single number <code>18.04</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-ubuntu-18.04.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-s">Pattern: \s</h4>
<p>It matches any whitespace character (<span>space</span>, <span>tab</span> or <span>newline</span>).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-any-whitespace.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-w">Pattern: \w</h4>
<p>It matches any of the small alphabets(a to z), capital alphabets(A to Z), digits (0 to 9), and underscore.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-w.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-">Pattern: .</h4>
<p>It matches any character except the new line (\n).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-everything-except-newline.png" alt=""></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'line 1</span><span>\n</span><span>line2'</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'2'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="pattern-negations">Pattern: Negations</h4>
<p>If you use the capitalized versions of the patterns above, they act as negation.</p>
<p>For example, if “\d” matched any digits from 0 to 9, then “\D” will match anything except “0 to 9”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-negation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="d-character-sets">d. Character sets</h3>
<p>These are patterns starting with <code>[</code> and ending with <code>]</code> and specify the characters that should be matched enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>For example, the following pattern matches any of the characters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-aeiou.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also replicate the functionality of <code>\d</code> using the below pattern. It will match any digits between 0 to 9.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-1-to-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of specifying all the digits, we can use <code>-</code> to specify only start and end digits. So, instead of <code>[0123456789]</code>, we can do:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-refactor-all-digits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, <code>[2-4]</code> can be used to match any digits between 2 to 4 i.e. (2 or 3 or 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-year-2014-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can even use the special characters we learned previously inside the brackets. For example, you can match any digit from 0 to 9 or whitespace as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-whitespace-or-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below, I have listed some useful common patterns and what they mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-common-pattern-for-bracket.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="e-anchors">e. Anchors</h3>
<p>Regex also has special handlers to make the pattern only match if it’s at the start or end of the string.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>^</code> anchor to match patterns only at the start of a line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-start-anchor.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>$</code> anchor after the character to match patterns only if it’s the end of the line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-anchor-end.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="f-escaping-metacharacters">f. Escaping metacharacters</h3>
<p>Consider a case where we want to exactly match the word “Mr. Stark”.</p>
<p>If we write a regex like <code>Mr. Stark</code>, then it will have an unintended effect. Since we know dot has a special meaning in a regex.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-issue.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we should always escape the special metacharacters like <code>.</code>, <code>$</code> etc. if our goal is to match the exact character itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-fixed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the list of metacharacters that you should remember to escape if you’re using them directly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>^ $ . * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="repetition-of-basic-blocks">Repetition of basic blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we can pattern match any characters, we could repeat things and start building more complicated patterns.</p>
<h3 id="a-naive-repetition">a. Naive repetition</h3>
<p>Using only what we have learned so far, a naive way would be to just repeat the pattern. For example, we can match two-digit numbers by just repeating the character-level pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-d-slash-d.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-quantifiers">b. Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Regex provides special quantifiers to specify different types of repetition for the character preceding it.</p>
<h4 id="i-fixed-repetition">i. Fixed repetition</h4>
<p>We can use the <code>{...}</code> quantifier to specify the number of times a pattern should repeat.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-manual-counts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the previous pattern for matching 2-digit number can be recreated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-it-is-2020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also specify a range of repetitions using the same quantifier. For example, to match from 2-digit to 4-digit numbers, we could use the pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-min-max-count.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When applied to a sentence, it will match both 4-digit and 2-digit numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-20-years-old.png" alt=""></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>
There should not be any space between minimum and maximum count For example, \d{2, 4} doesn't work.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="ii-flexible-quantifiers">ii. Flexible quantifiers</h4>
<p>Regex also provides quantifiers “*”, “+” and “?” using which you can specify flexible repetition of a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>0 or 1 times</strong>: <code>?</code><br>
The <code>?</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 0 or 1 times. This can be useful to make certain parts optional.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-clarify.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to match both the word “sound” and “sound” where “s” is optional. Then, we can use the <code>?</code> quantifier that matches if a character repeats 0 or 1 times.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-example.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>one or more times</strong>: <code>+</code><br>
The <code>+</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 1 or more times.</p>
<p>For example, we could find numbers of any arbitrary length using the regex <code>\d+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-example-of-plus.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zero or more times</strong>: <code>*</code><br>
The <code>*</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats zero or more times.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-in-python">Usage in Python</h2>
<p>Python provides a module called “re” in the standard library to work with regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-raw-strings">Need for raw strings</h3>
<p>To specify a regular expression in Python, we precede it with <strong>r</strong> to create raw strings.</p>

<p>To understand why we precede with <strong>r</strong>, let’s try printing the expression <strong>\t</strong> without <code>**r**</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see how when we don’t use raw string, the string <code>\t</code> is treated as the escape character for tab by Python.</p>
<p>Now let’s convert it into raw string. We get back whatever we specified.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>r'\t'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>
\<span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="using-re-module">Using re module</h3>
<p>To use <code>re</code> module, we can start by importing the <code>re</code> module as:</p>

<h4 id="1-refindall">1. re.findall</h4>
<p>This function allows us to get all the matches as a list of strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'\d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123456'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="2-rematch">2. re.match</h4>
<p>This function searches for a pattern at the beginning of the string and returns the first occurrence as a match object. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='batman'&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-object.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the match object, we can get the matched text as</p>


<p>In a case where our pattern is not at the start of the sentence, we will not get any match.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'The batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="3-research">3. re.search</h4>
<p>This function also finds the first occurrence of a pattern but the pattern can occur anywhere in the text. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'the batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>.</span><span>group</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic stuff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes users often rely on the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and cluster autoscaling to scale applications. We show how using Red Sky Ops to optimize the whole application alongside the HPA improves cost and performance using the example of a web-application.</p>





<h2><strong>What is the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler?</strong></h2>





<p>The<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Horizontal Pod Autoscaler</a> (HPA) in Kubernetes scales up and down the number of replicas in a deployment or a stateful set based on metrics prescribed by the user. The most common metrics are CPU and memory utilization of the target pods.&nbsp;</p>





<p>To deploy the HPA, the user sets target metrics for all replicas in a deployment as well as the minimum and maximum number of replicas. The HPA is responsible for adding or deleting replicas to keep the observed metrics lower than the target values while keeping the number of replicas within the prescribed bounds.</p>





<p>When scaling based on CPU and memory utilization, HPA uses the metrics.k8s.io API implemented by the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metrics-server</a>. The HPA can also use<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/custom-metrics-api.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> custom metrics</a> or external metrics (e.g. number of requests per second on the ingress) implemented by a third-party or the user.</p>





<h2><strong>HPA tuning challenges</strong></h2>





<p>Optimizing the target metrics of the HPA for all applications and their specific workloads can be frustrating. While newer versions of kubernetes support more in depth configuration of the HPA through policies<a href="#note">*</a>, many users are left with a minimal set of configuration options: namely a cpu/memory utilization target and the maximum number of replicas.</p>





<p>If the application is a web server for example, the speed at which the HPA adds replicas is critical to accommodate bursts in traffic. A simple fix would be to reduce the CPU utilization target to a small value (say 15%) so that the HPA adds replicas early on when the traffic increases. However, this increases your cloud cost because many replicas are underutilized. To limit the cost, one could use replicas with a high CPU utilization target. If the traffic increases, while the HPA is creating replicas waiting to be available, the current replicas experience CPU throttling and the HTTP request latency increases, impacting the clients experience.</p>





<p>A ML-powered experimentation engine such as <a href="https://github.com/redskyops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Sky Ops</a> can be used to design a highly available, scalable and cost-efficient application. Let’s demonstrate this using an example web application.</p>





<h2><strong>Example web application</strong></h2>





<p>In the following example, we will optimize the <a href="https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker example voting app</a> using Red Sky Ops. This app is a simple distributed application that allows the user to vote between two options – cats or dogs.</p>





<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FbR98IC_2s4U7qpocG4wyH_iAWd8k9aAwai5OTLYvDezvic2HrNZLbqfI-9ABGgoR6RPJxESclSW5oYGyF3m-s6tfS3ByaensHUNlUIMLaIJ69-znggPRpL2WAYxHX4fkGYAlUQ" alt=""></figure>





<p>A Redis queue collects the votes. Workers consume the votes and insert them in a postgres database. Finally there is a node.js webapp that shows the results of the voting in real time. You can deploy this application in a dedicated namespace with:</p>





<pre>kustomize build github.com/redskyops/redskyops-recipes/voting-webapp/application | kubectl apply -f -</pre>





<h2><strong>Red Sky Ops experiments</strong></h2>





<p>An “experiment” is made of multiple trials whereby the Red Sky Ops server patches the whole application to find the optimal configuration. For each trial, the application is tested using a scalability test. At the end of each test, the Red Sky Ops controller measures metrics to optimize for. In this experiment, we will optimize for two metrics of opposite goals: cost of running the application (in $/month) and p95 latency (in ms). While the performance increases with resources, cost becomes problematic. On the other hand, starving an application reduces user experience. Machine learning helps finding the best tradeoff. You can find detailed instructions to run the experiment yourself <a href="https://github.com/redskyops/redskyops-recipes/tree/master/hpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> with Locust.</p>





<p>We are using the HPA to scale up and down the number of replicas of the front-end deployment responsible for the user experience. For simplicity, we will tune HPA using a target utilization available via the metrics server. The parameters that we are optimizing are the minimum and maximum number of replicas, target utilization used by the HPA and CPU requests for the voting-service pod. Note that every pod runs with a guaranteed QoS (limits=requests).</p>





<p>We run the experiment for 400 trials, and consider a trial as failed if the response latency is greater than one second.</p>





<h2><strong>Scalability test</strong></h2>





<p>During each trial we load test the application with increasing requests per second (RPS): 100 RPS for one minute, 500 RPS for one minute, 1000 RPS for one minute, 2000 for one minute. This allows us to test the scalability of the application and make sure that the HPA is configured correctly. The application should be able to minimize the cost for a low level of traffic (100 RPS) but still able to scale up fast enough to 2000 RPS.</p>





<h2><strong>Experiment results</strong></h2>





<p>We first set a baseline configuration with:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=3<br>Maximum replicas=7<br>CPU utilization target=65%<br>CPU per replica=2&nbsp;</pre>





<p>In this case the cost is $481/month to run this application for a p95 latency of 579 milliseconds.</p>





<p>Each dot represents the metric values measured at the end of each trial (<a href="#figure-1">see Figure 1</a>). The red dots are the best trials found during the experiment, i.e. there is no better configuration for one metric without increasing the value of the other metric. After some exploration of the parameter space, the algorithm converges towards optimal configurations. We find a sharp transition in latency around a cost of $330 per month, where the most satisfying performance is achieved. We find that the best application is obtained for:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=10<br>Maximum replicas=15<br>CPU utilization target=80%<br>CPU per replica=0.855</pre>





<p>The cost of running this application is $365/month (24% savings) while the latency is 27.8 milliseconds (95% increase in performance). The advantage of providing multiple best configurations is the ability for the user to pick based on experience. For example, if an experienced devops engineer wants a more scalable application in case of larger spikes of traffic than the ones created for the load test, the following configuration can be chosen:</p>





<pre>Minimum replicas=3<br>Maximum replicas=9<br>CPU utilization target=10%<br>CPU per replica=0.849</pre>





<p>The cost is $344/month (28% savings) while the latency is 60 milliseconds (89% increase in performance). Because the CPU utilization target per replica is lower in this case, a sudden burst in traffic triggers a scale up from the HPA early allowing for the newly added replicas to be available.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Red Sky Ops experiment results</p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>





<p>Using Red Sky Ops, we can deploy a web application using the HPA that efficiently scales and avoids over provisioning for spikes in traffic.</p>





<p>We decided to tune the CPU target utilization of the HPA. This is more of an infrastructure monitoring approach that is made available quite easily by the metrics server. A different approach would have been to tune the HPA based on the number of requests-per-second on the ingress. Check out this great<a href="https://medium.com/uptime-99/kubernetes-hpa-autoscaling-with-custom-and-external-metrics-da7f41ff7846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> blog post</a> on how to set up the external metrics server to work with the HPA.</p>





<p>Like the<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> USE</a> and <a href="https://www.weave.works/blog/the-red-method-key-metrics-for-microservices-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RED</a> methods for monitoring your infrastructure and user experience, the Red Sky Ops experiments can be written to optimize both of your infrastructure cost and usage and/or user experience on your deployed application.</p>





<p>Finally, Red Sky Ops allows you to efficiently find the optimal configurations when the correlations are<a href="https://www.carbonrelay.com/blog/the-new-basics-of-configuration-management-in-kubernetes/"> too complicated for a human to understand</a>. For this example, we have oversimplified the application to easily interpret the results, but in production one would tune the resources of all the deployments.</p>

<p id="note"><strong>*Note:</strong> For v1.18+ the HPA API will allow the scaling behavior to be configurable, allowing the user to design the scale up and scale down policies.</p>





<p><code><code>scaleDown: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stabilizationWindowSeconds: 300 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- type: Percent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value: 100<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periodSeconds: 15<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;scaleUp:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stabilizationWindowSeconds: 0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- type: Percent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value: 100<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periodSeconds: 15<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- type: Pods<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value: 4<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;periodSeconds: 15<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selectPolicy: Max</code></code></p>

				<p>After <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">adopting an AWS tagging strategy</a>, you face two new challenges: finding improperly tagged AWS resources and enforcing your tagging strategy going forward. In <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices-guide-part-2/" target="_blank">the previous installment</a> of this guide, you saw how to enforce your AWS tagging strategy when creating new resources with Terraform or CloudFormation. In this part, you’ll see how to find improperly tagged AWS resources.</p>

<p>Tagging your resources in AWS will help prevent misuse and maintain your infrastructure. When combined with a tool like <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/?utm_source=blog" target="_blank">CloudForecast</a>, tagging your resources can help you predict and control your monthly spending, so it’s usually worthwhile to invest in tag maintenance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s easy for AWS tags to get out of date. If you’re <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices/" target="_blank">adopting a new tagging strategy</a>, you likely have a lot of catching up to do, but even if you’ve been following one for years, things can get stale. Your team may want to change the name of a tag or update the rules surrounding certain tags. Developers may leave without handing off resources they managed, or someone might forget to change an outdated tag on an AWS resource. Even the best AWS tagging policy will require ongoing maintenance, especially as the number of resources you manage grows.</p>

<p>To help maintain your AWS tags, you should regularly audit them to make sure they’re still accurate. At a small company, it might be possible to do these audits manually, but you’ll need to use tools to help you automate the process as you grow. This article will show you six tools you can use to help find and fix outdated AWS tags. You’ll see some of the use cases for each so you can decide which ones are best for your organization. I’ll do a deep dive into the first two because they’re the most commonly used today, but it’s a good idea to have a few options to choose from.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cloud Custodian</li>
  <li>AWS Config Rules</li>
  <li>Retro Tag</li>
  <li>Gold Fig</li>
  <li>AWS OrganizationTag Policies</li>
  <li>CloudForecast Tagging Compliance Report</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="cloud-custodian">Cloud Custodian</h2>

<p><a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/" target="_blank">Cloud Custodian</a> is an open-source collection of scripts that help developers manage their public cloud accounts. For this article, I’ll limit my focus to Cloud Custodian’s tag maintenance features in AWS, but it supports <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/examples/index.html" target="_blank">a variety of use cases</a> and most of the major cloud hosting providers.</p>

<p>One use case for Cloud Custodian is to find AWS resources that don’t comply with your tagging policy. Let’s say you have an application consisting of an elastic load balancer and three EC2 instances like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uLKRhFH.png" alt="The desired state of AWS tags in the demo architecture"></p>

<p>And you want all your EC2 instances to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have an <code>env</code> tag with a value.</li>
  <li>Have a <code>contact</code> tag with either <code>j-mark</code> or <code>l-duke</code> as the value.</li>
  <li>Have a <code>service</code> tag with either <code>cart</code> or <code>search</code> as the value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud Custodian’s policies are stored in <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/quickstart/policyStructure.html" target="_blank">YAML files</a> so there’s no state to maintain outside of the policy itself. To create a policy that will tell you if any of your EC2 instances aren’t in compliance with the above rules, create a new policy file called <code>policy.yml</code>:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can run Cloud Custodian from your local machine or <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/cron-job" target="_blank">set up a cron job</a> to run it from a server on a recurring basis. <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/quickstart/index.html#install-cc" target="_blank">Once installed</a>, run the above Cloud Custodian policy from your command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>custodian run <span>-s</span> ./ policy.yml
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cloud Custodian will output a “count” of the number of EC2 instances that are missing one of your required tags and generate a report in your output folder (<code>./</code> in this case) that includes more details about the resources so you can remedy their tags.</p>

<p>Cloud Custodian can also <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/actions.html" target="_blank">perform actions</a> to remediate or alert you to issues automatically. For example, you may want to call a webhook that triggers a notification when an EC2 instance doesn’t adhere to your tagging policy.</p>

<p>To add a webhook action, replace your <code>policy.yml</code> file with the following:</p>

<p>Now when you run Cloud Custodian, it will call <code>https://example.com/hooks?id=1</code> if any EC2 instances fail to adhere to your policy. There are <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/examples/tagcompliance.html" target="_blank">many examples in their docs</a> for using filters and actions to perform other tasks. While running Cloud Custodian locally from your command line is a good way to test your configuration, you should ultimately <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/deployment.html" target="_blank">deploy your policies to a server</a> to run them against your production environment on a schedule. You can even deploy Cloud Custodian policies as a periodic <a href="https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/policy/lambda.html" target="_blank">Lambda function</a> to help minimize the cost.</p>

<h2 id="aws-config-rules">AWS Config Rules</h2>

<p>Amazon’s official tool for auditing your resources is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" target="_blank">AWS Config</a>. Like Cloud Custodian, it can be used to check a range of compliance and configuration settings, but I’ll focus on its <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/required-tags.html" target="_blank">managed rules for requiring tags</a>.</p>

<p>Using AWS Config, you can specify which resources should have tags and the expected values for each tag. AWS Config allows you to run remediation steps when a violation is found so that your team can quickly fix tagging mistakes, but it doesn’t prevent you from creating resources with improper tags. For that, you’ll have to go back to <a href="https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/aws-tagging-best-practices-guide-part-2/" target="_blank">the previous installment of this guide</a>.</p>

<p>To reproduce the Cloud Custodian policy above, go to <strong>AWS Config &gt; Rules &gt; Add rule</strong>. Enter “required-tags” in the search bar and select the required tags rule.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l9EvLGJ.png" alt="Creating an AWS Config Rule for required tags, step 1"></p>

<p>Name the rule, add a description, and select the resources you want this rule to apply to. In this case, enter <code>EC2: Instance</code> only if you just want to make sure your EC2 instances are correctly tagged.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I313Xf2.png" alt="Creating an AWS Config Rule for required tags, step 2"></p>

<p>Next, enter the tags and allowed values that you want to enforce. To replicate the Cloud Custodian policy above, set:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>tag1Key</code> = <code>env</code> with a blank value</li>
  <li><code>tag2Key</code> = <code>contact</code> and <code>tag2Value</code> = <code>j-mark,l-duke</code></li>
  <li><code>tag3Key</code> = <code>service</code> and <code>tag3Value</code> = <code>cart,search</code></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zo50csf.png" alt="Creating an AWS Config Rule for required tags, step 3"></p>

<p>Skip the remediation details for now and click “Save.” You’ll be taken back to the list of AWS Config Rules. The initial check will take a few minutes to run, so wait a bit then refresh the page. AWS Config will show you a list of which resources are in compliance and which are not. Be aware that AWS Config <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=192627" target="_blank">can take up to 6 hours to reindex your tags</a> after they’ve been changed on your resources.</p>

<p>If you want to call a webhook like you did for Cloud Custodian above, you will need to create an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-http-https-endpoint-as-subscriber.html" target="_blank">SNS topic that calls a webhook</a>. After creating the topic, edit the rule and select <code>AWS-PublishSNSNotification</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6LsSOOw.png" alt="Adding remediation to an AWS Config Rule, step 1"></p>

<p>Add an IAM Role ARN with SNS access to the <code>AutomationAssumeRole</code> field, add a message, and paste the <code>TopicArn</code> from your SNS topic. This will allow AWS Config to trigger the SNS topic references when the config rule fails.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DYDXOVf.png" alt="Adding remediation to an AWS Config Rule, step 2"></p>

<p>Click “Save.” Now, when new EC2 instances are found that fail this compliance check, the SNS topic will call your webhook. This isn’t the only remediation step available, so read more about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/remediation.html" target="_blank">your remediation options in the AWS Config docs</a>.</p>

<p>While the AWS Config rules aren’t as powerful as Cloud Custodian’s, there are some advantages. It’s built into AWS and works with CloudFormation. This means there are fewer extra files to manage, and AWS Config provides a visual configuration timeline that will help you track down improper tagging practices.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/O17fiEz.png" alt="AWS Config configuration timeline"></p>

<p>That said, <a href="https://summitroute.com/blog/2019/02/06/should_you_use_aws_config/" target="_blank">there are other problems with it</a> like its lack of support for some resources and cost. If you’re deciding between AWS Config and Cloud Custodian, you might want to do a deeper dive into each tool to determine which will work best for your team.</p>

<h2 id="retro-tag">Retro Tag</h2>

<p>Unlike the previous two tools, <a href="https://www.gorillastack.com/news/retro-tag-retroactively-tag-aws-resources/" target="_blank">Retro Tag</a> wasn’t built for finding untagged resources directly, but instead, it focuses on helping you track down the creator of every resource in your AWS account. This is an useful step in auditing your tags because the person who created the resource usually knows the most about it. Once you find the creator, you can ask them how the resource is being used (if at all) and put them in charge of fixing the tags.</p>

<p>Retro Tag is open-source and built on the <a href="https://github.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag" target="_blank">Auto Tag</a> engine by GorillaStack. It works by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/" target="_blank">AWS Athena</a> to export a CSV of your relevant <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" target="_blank">CloudTrail events</a>. The Retro Tag script uses this CSV to tag any resources that still exist and don’t yet have an <code>AutoTag_Creator</code> or <code>AutoTag_CreateTime</code> tag.</p>

<p>If you’re using <a href="https://github.com/GorillaStack/auto-tag" target="_blank">Auto Tag</a> to add creator tags to all new resources, Retro Tag is a great way to catch up on resources that were created before Auto Tag was installed. That said, you don’t have to run both of them together. You may just want to add creator tags to old resources so you can assign responsibility for updating tags to the creator rather than doing it yourself.</p>

<h2 id="gold-fig">Gold Fig</h2>

<p>While Cloud Custodian and AWS Config audit your resources on the fly, <a href="https://github.com/goldfiglabs/goldfig" target="_blank">Gold Fig</a> takes a different approach to the problem. It loads all your AWS resource data into a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgres database</a> and gives you a command-line interface to run queries against it. Gold Fig is also open-source, so you can deploy it to your local machine or a server that automatically syncs the data regularly.</p>

<p>Gold Fig doesn’t offer remediation actions like Cloud Custodian, but developers familiar with SQL might find the query syntax more natural than learning another flavor of YAML. Because loading your data from AWS takes several minutes, it also isn’t ideal for tracking real-time updates to your resources. But, if you’d like to perform periodic audits on your resources using complex …</p></div></div>

</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
― Arthur C. Clarke, Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ever since Raspberry Pi came into my world, I have been exploring better ways to interact with it. Take Kodi the media player for example - yes, keyboard and mouse are fine; yes, the native web interface is super powerful; and yes, you can even use your TV remote directly if it’s HDMI-CEC-compatible. But there’s something about Raspberry Pi’s small form factor (and perhaps its open source spirit) that just makes me wish for a hands-free experience.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would like my Google Home Mini/Google Assistant to pick up my voice command, send it over to the Raspberry Pi and make it to do something useful. To my great surprise, there doesn’t seem to be a satisfactory end-to-end solution anywhere that suits my need. However, that’s about to change - please join me in my quest to build a voice-controlled Raspberry Pi. Before we dive into the technical mumbo jumbo, here is a quick rundown of all the hardware/software we need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://kodi.tv/">Kodi</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/adnanh/webhook">Webhook</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">Port forwarding</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/">FreeDNS</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://assistant.google.com/">Google Assistant</a> (or any voice assistant that IFTTT supports for that matter)</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay Google, pause Kodi and let’s get started.</p>


<p>For those who are unfamiliar with the name, Kodi is an all-in-one solution for media consumption. For starter, it integrates almost every video streaming service on earth into a unified interface, be it YouTube, Netflix or even Google Drive. In addition to its core functionalities as a media player, Kodi supports extensions that can do much more through the installation of add-ons. Did I mention that it has a lovely weather widget?</p>

<p>Kodi also shines in the input department. On top of the keyboard/mouse, web interface or TV remote option, the <code>kodi-send</code> command lets user control the player via command line. For example, if we are interested in replicating the effect of pressing the play button, we only need to need to run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kodi-send <span>--action</span><span>=</span><span>"PlayerControl(play)"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To wrap it in a shell, let’s create the following script <code>/usr/local/bin/pictrl</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
<span>action</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$action</span><span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"play"</span> <span>]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span><span>$action</span><span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"pause"</span> <span>]</span>
<span>then
  </span>kodi-send <span>--action</span><span>=</span><span>"PlayerControl(play)"</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and it’s ready to roll. Since play and pause are basically the same command in different contexts, we also get the pause function for free.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use <code>pictrl play</code> in the command line interface (or over SSH) to play (or pasue) the video on your Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="webhook---listening-and-responding-to-a-web-request">Webhook - Listening and Responding to a Web Request</h2>

<p>Next up we are going to trigger that <code>pictrl</code> script with an http request. For that, we will use webhook, a cool piece of technology that enables responding to http requests with custom callbacks.</p>

<p>To enable webhook, first create the configuration file <code>/etc/webhook.conf</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"pictrl"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"execute-command"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/usr/local/bin/pictrl"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"command-working-directory"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/home/pi/"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"pass-arguments-to-command"</span><span>:</span><span>
    </span><span>[</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"source"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"query"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"action"</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>that points a new webhook instance to the <code>pictrl</code> command. After that, the webhook can be started as a service using:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl start webhook
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or auto-started upon startup by running:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable </span>webhook
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that for such a service that is intended to be accessible over the internet (as will become true in the next step), it’s probably a good idea to authenticate the identity of the requestor in some form. For example, you can ask the requestor to submit a token that only a trusted user knows along with the request itself.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://localipaddress:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device within the same network to control your Kodi player.</p>

<h2 id="port-forwarding---exposing-local-service-to-the-public">Port Forwarding - Exposing Local Service to the Public</h2>

<p>A local IP address, by definition, isn’t visible outside the local network. To fix the problem, it’s generally required to log on to your modem/router as admin and configure what’s known as port forwarding. From then on, instead of using <code>http://localipaddress:port</code> locally, we can call <code>http://publicipaddress:port</code> over the internet and the request will be directed to the same place.</p>

<p>In case you don’t have admin control over your modem (which is unfortunately true in my case), <a href="https://webhookrelay.com/">Webhook Relay</a> can be helpful although its free tier only supports up to 150 “relays” per month. Another service called <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> can be equally effective, with the catch being no permanent subdomain support for the free tier users. Other solutions include a dedicated VPN/VPS that allows for port forwarding. You see, they all cost money if you want the optimal experience.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://publicipaddress:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device that’s connected to the internet to control your video player.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-dns---your-raspberry-pis-permanent-domain-name">Dynamic DNS - Your Raspberry Pi’s Permanent Domain Name</h2>

<p>For most internet users at home, chances are that their public IP addresses aren’t static. With each reboot of the modem, a new address will be assigned by the ISP which makes it annoying if you are looking for a more permanent solution. Don’t worry - dynamic DNS services such as FreeDNS can come to the rescue. These services essentially maintain a list that maps the domain (or subdomain) names to their corresponding IP addresses, and each user tells them to update the list whenever the IP address changes. To automate this, run the following command at Raspberry Pi’s startup:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>wget https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?[yourtokenhere]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If all goes well, instead of changing <code>http://publicipaddress</code> each time the modem restarts, a new and permanent name <code>http://domainname</code> is all we have to remember.</p>

<p><strong>Milestone</strong>: now you can use the link <code>http://domainname:port/hooks/pictrl?action=play</code> on any device on the internet to control your video player.</p>

<h2 id="ifttt---connecting-to-a-voice-assistant">IFTTT - Connecting to A Voice Assistant</h2>

<p>IFTTT, short for “If This Then That”, provides a convenient way to create a hub that connects a variety of services (including voice assistants) where they can interact with each another based on a set of user-defined rules (called applets). At the time of writing, IFTTT allows each user to create up to 3 applets for its free tier. As the name implies, every applet follows the “If This Then That” structure:</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/1.jpg">
</p>

<p>and creating a new applet boils down to defining the two pieces: the “If This” and the “Then That”.</p>

<p>So let’s configure the “If This” first by selecting the Google Assistant option (you might be asked to link your Google account to IFTTT). In the next screen, although the “Say a simple phrase” option is more than enough to get the job done, the “Say a phrase with a text ingredient” option is preferred as it will be a lot more flexible when it comes to further customizing our voice commands.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/3.jpg">
</p>

<p>That brings us to the trigger configuration. Personally, I use “kodi” as my keyword, followed by a custom text field. The rest is not important.</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/4.jpg">
</p>

<p>Next, onto the “Then That” piece, what we want to choose is the webhook service that we created in the previous step, with the exact action being configurable for future development’s sake:</p>

<p><img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/6.jpg">
</p>

<p>Save and continue. That’s it - our first IFTTT applet has just become fully operational.</p>

<p><strong>Final milestone</strong>: now you can say the following magic words to play (or pause) the video on your Raspberry Pi’s Kodi player:</p>



<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>

<p><img src="https://shawenyao.github.io/Photos/IFTTT/logo2.png">
</p>

<p>As you might have noticed by now, your voice can be literally as powerful as your computer is. The toolchain we’ve explored so far makes it possible to invoke almost any action of our choice with almost any words of our choice. What’s more, any additional development will only need to happen locally inside the <code>pictrl</code> dispatcher, so it’s easily scalable if we want our Raspberry Pi to learn a new trick. Last but not least, what to do with such limitless possibility might be a matter of user experience at the end of the day, so please let me know what your mileage turns out to be.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>
<h3 id="install-all-the-software-packages-mentioned-above">Install all the software packages mentioned above</h3>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>kodi
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>kodi-eventclients-kodi-send
<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>webhook
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Update Oct 22, 2020: Included discussion on other solutions when port forwarding is not an option. Thanks to Mike Foden (@mikefoden) for bringing up ngrok.</p>

October 21, 2020 | https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/lumi-one-of-the-worlds-mightiest-supercomputers | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/lumi-one-of-the-worlds-mightiest-supercomputers">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>One of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, LUMI, will start its operations in CSC’s data center in Kajaani, Finland, next year. The peak performance of LUMI is an astonishing 552 petaflop/s. To date, the world’s fastest computer, Fugaku in Japan, reaches peak performance of 513 petaflop/s. When LUMI’s operations start next year, it will be one of the world’s fastest supercomputers.</p>
<p>LUMI is a unique European endeavor, with ten European countries and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) investing in one joint system. It is set to boost research, employment, and competitiveness throughout Europe. The procurement process of LUMI is now complete, and the system supplier is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), providing an HPE Cray EX supercomputer with next generation AMD EPYC™ CPUs and AMD Instinct™ GPUs. In addition to the remarkable computing power, LUMI is also one of the world’s most advanced platforms for artificial intelligence and it will be one of the world’s best known scientific instruments throughout its lifetime.</p>
<p>– Today we mark an important step forward in the realisation of the European High-Performance Computing strategy. The pre-exascale supercomputer hosted by the LUMI consortium will be among the top 5 in the world. Together with the other EuroHPC pre-exascale and petascale supercomputers that will be deployed in 2021, the LUMI supercomputer will help Europe’s public and private users address many daunting research and innovation problems across different areas from weather and climate change through cybersecurity to drug discovery and personalised medicine. LUMI supercomputer aligns the Digital and Green Deal policies of the European Commission, using 100% renewable carbon neutral energy. Moreover, the heat generated will provide 20 percent of the district heat of the area, being one of the most efficient supercomputers in the world, says <strong>Khalil Rouhana</strong>, Deputy Director-General of the Directorate‑General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) of the European Commission.</p>
<p>– Once operational in mid-2021, the LUMI supercomputer will be one of the most competitive and green supercomputers in the world! Such a leadership-class system will support European researchers, industry, and public sector, in better understanding and responding to complex challenges and transforming them into innovation opportunities in sectors like health, weather forecasting, or urban and rural planning, says the Executive Director of EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, <strong>Anders Dam Jensen</strong>.</p>
<p>– We are committed to supporting the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) to seize opportunities in next-generation supercomputing and bolster R&amp;D in science, advance innovation, and unlock economic growth. We are honored to continue collaborating with EuroHPC JU, and through our partnership with AMD, build one of the world’s fastest pre-exascale supercomputers for Europe.”, says <strong>Peter Ungaro</strong>, senior vice president, and general manager, high-performance computing (HPC) and mission critical solutions (MCS), HPE.</p>
<p>– The reliability of CSC and Finland made the European Commission and ten partner countries to invest in one pan-European high-performance computing and data management infrastructure in Finland. We have to keep up the excellent collaboration in order to maximize this investment to benefit society on a larger scale, says Permanent Secretary <strong>Anita Lehikoinen</strong> from Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland</p>
<p>LUMI is an investment of over 200 million euros, covering the whole lifecycle of the system. It will lift Europe to the forefront of high performance computing (HPC) and research. Exploiting the potential of the data economy is crucial for Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>– The investment will make CSC data center one of the world’s largest players in the field of HPC. The joint procurement process with the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and ten European countries has proceeded on schedule despite the global pandemic, thanks to the vast know-how of the LUMI consortium and the excellent collaboration. LUMI’s astonishing computing power combined with a highly modern artificial intelligence platform and data management infrastructure will help European researchers tackle unforeseen research challenges, says CSC’s Managing Director <strong>Kimmo Koski</strong>.</p>
<p>The uptake of HPC will remarkably increase the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe remarkably. Up to one-fifth of LUMI’s resources will be available for industry and SMEs.</p>
<p>– The technology we are using is strongly based on mathematical modelling: analyses, artificial intelligence, simulations, and optimization. Therefore, powerful computing capacity and data management infrastructure are of the utmost importance for us. The LUMI infrastructure will open up entirely new possibilities for us, which we may exploit, says Anna-Maria Henell, CEO of Disior Ltd. Disior is a Finnish company developing software for analysing medical images in 3D.</p>

<p><strong>Supercomputers enable the fight against pandemics and help resolve unforeseen research questions<br>
</strong>LUMI’s top-notch computing resources are needed in leading-edge research in a wide range of data- and computing-intensive fields. Examples include climate, pharmaceutical, and artificial intelligence.<br>
LUMI will also have a fast-track for urgent computing in time- and mission-critical simulations. This kind of simulation might be, for example, related to a large epidemic or pandemic disease. The current COVID-19 pandemic has largely benefitted from supercomputers: supercomputers have been used for example to simulate studies related to vaccine research and defeat the spread of the virus. With its vast computing resources, LUMI can address different research challenges even faster than before. In addition, it will enable addressing totally new types of scientific challenges combining multidisciplinary research and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>World-class environmental sustainability and energy-efficiency</strong><br>
As a carbon-neutral data center, LUMI helps the European ICT sector in becoming greener and more cost-efficient, which is a necessity for reaching EU’s ambitious climate targets and paving the way for the green transition. CSC’s data center in Kajaani is among the world’s most eco-efficient: it uses 100% renewable energy produced with hydropower. LUMI’s waste heat will be used in Kajaani’s district heating network: 20% of the area’s yearly district heating needs will be covered with LUMI’s waste heat.</p>
<p><strong>LUMI system architecture explained:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The LUMI system will be supplied by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), based on an HPE Cray EX supercomputer.</li>
<li>The peak performance of LUMI is an astonishing 552 petaflop/s meaning 552 *10<sup>15</sup> floating point operations per second. This figure makes LUMI one of the world’s fastest supercomputers. For comparison, the world’s fastest computer today (Fugaku in Japan) reaches 513 petaflop/s and the second fastest (Summit in the US) 200 petaflop/s (more information: <a href="http://www.top500.org/">www.top500.org</a>). If LUMI’s computing power was compared to normal laptops, it would require 1.5 million laptops together to reach the performance of LUMI. If these laptops were piled up, they would form a tower of over 23 kilometers high!</li>
<li>LUMI will also be one of the most advanced platforms in the world for artificial intelligence (AI). With LUMI, it will be possible to combine AI, especially deep learning, and traditional large scale simulations combined with massive scale data analytics in solving one research problem.</li>
<li>The number crunching capability of LUMI is accelerated by the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) partition. It is based on the future generation AMD Instinct™ GPU.</li>
<li>LUMI will be complemented by a CPU (Central Processing Unit) partition, featuring 64-core next-generation AMD EPYC™ CPUs.</li>
<li>LUMI’s data analytics partition has 32 aggregated terabytes of memory and 64 visualization GPUs. This partition is used e.g. for visualization, heavy data analysis, meshing, and pre/post-processing.</li>
<li>LUMI’s storage system will consist of three components. First, there will be a 7-petabyte partition of ultra-fast flash storage, combined with a more traditional 80-petabyte capacity storage, both based on the Lustre parallel filesystem, as well as a data management service, based on Ceph and being 30 petabytes in volume.</li>
<li>In total, LUMI will have astounding storage of 117 petabytes and an impressive aggregated I/O bandwidth of 2 terabytes per second</li>
<li>LUMI will also have an OpenShift/Kubernetes container cloud platform for running microservices.</li>
<li>All the different compute and storage partitions are connected to the very fast Cray Slingshot interconnect of 200 Gbit/s. The global bandwidth of the LUMI-GPU partition is 160 TB/s. The global Internet traffic would fit therein, in fact, two times!</li>
<li>LUMI takes over 150m2 of space, which is about the size of a tennis court. The weight of the system is nearly 150 000 kilograms (150 metric tons).</li>

              <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> is a popular messaging app. It is well-known for its security and efficiency. Apart from being able to send messages to each other, its users can also create bots to automate certain routine tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this tutorial, we will use Telegram's <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">bot API</a> to create a news bot using
              <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews API</a>. We will use Python programming language, as it provides convenient abstractions over the bot API.

            <!-- Text -->
            <p>
             We will use python-telegram-bot wrapper around the official API. This library significantly simplifies the job of the programmer when writing a bot. It is always easier to learn something new by reading through a couple of examples. Here is one:
            </p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>from telegram.ext import Updater, CommandHandler


USAGE = '/greet &lt;name&gt; - Greet me!'


def start(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(USAGE)


def greet_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(f'Hello {context.args[0]}!')


def main():
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater = Updater("TOKEN", use_context=True)
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp = updater.dispatcher 

&nbsp;&nbsp;# on different commands - answer in Telegram 
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start)) 
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command)) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;# Start the Bot 
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.start_polling() 
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.idle() 


if __name__ == '__main__': 
&nbsp;&nbsp;main()</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
              This small piece of code creates a bot that recognizes two commands:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>/start</span> - the bot will respond with the help page to this one.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>/greet</span> - this command receives an argument (e.g. Datanews) and responds with <span>Hello Datanews!</span>.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let's go through each line in detail and discuss what this code does.</p>

            <p>We start with the <span>main</span> function:</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def main():
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater = Updater("TOKEN", use_context=True)
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp = updater.dispatcher

&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
&nbsp;&nbsp;dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command))

&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.start_polling()
&nbsp;&nbsp;updater.idle()</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>
              This function sets up all the necessary machinery needed for our bot to work. Particularly, it creates an instance of the Updater class. Note that you need a Telegram token to be able to use Telegram bot API. Check out the official guide on how to create bots
              <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Back to the code! The purpose of the <span>Updater</span> is to deliver updates (e.g. messages sent by users) to <span>Dispatcher</span>. When the latter receives an update, it tries to dispatch some of the user-specified callbacks to handle it. Each of those callbacks is managed by some handler.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can think of a handler as a function to handle an update that is only executed when some condition is met. The condition in question, though, depends on the handler and can be specified by the programmer. In our case, we have two instances of <span>CommandHandler</span> class.
            </p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
dp.add_handler(CommandHandler("greet", greet_command))</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Each of them handles a particular command, supported by our bot - <span>/start</span> and <span>/greet</span> respectively.</p>

            <p>Then we call <span>start_polling</span> method.</p>

            

            <p>This will make our bot periodically fetch updates from the Telegram server. This method will internally create two threads: one will poll updates from the Telegram server, the other one will be used by the dispatcher to handle those updates.</p>

            <p>The next line makes sure our bot correctly handles various interruption signals (e.g. <span>SIGINT</span>).</p>

            

            <p>This is required when we want our bot to have persistent state. You can learn more about it and other cool library features in their
              <a href="https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

            <p>Let's now discuss two callback functions that handle bot's commands:</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def start(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(USAGE)


def greet_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text(f'Hello {context.args[0]}!')</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Each of these functions takes two arguments:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>update</span> - an update received by our bot from Telegram servers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>context</span> - contains various useful methods and information. For example, it has user_data dictionary which can store various user-related information.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Additionally, each of these methods sends a text message back to the user.</p>
            
            <p>You can check out more elaborate examples of Telegram bots in the library's official <a href="https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot">repo</a>.</p>

            <p>Let's now move on to the main topic of our discussion.</p>
          </div>

            <h2>
              Datanews API overview
            </h2>

            <p><a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> provides API for retrieving and monitoring news from more than a thousand different newspapers, news aggregators and other websites. We collect and process more than 100k news articles a day. Naturally, we provide a flexible and easy-to-use API for querying those articles. For our small project, though, we only need a small part of that API. Particularly, we want our bot to be able to:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Retrieve articles based on a query string, sent by the user.</li>
              <li>Retrieve articles from some particular publisher.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              These use-cases can be handled by a single end-point - /headlines. You can learn more about the provided API in the
              <a href="https://datanews.io/docs">official documentation</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Now we can go straight to the implementation of our bot.</p>
          </div>
        </div> <!-- / .row -->
      </div> <!-- / .container -->
    </section>

        <!-- SECTION

          <div>

            <!-- Heading -->
            <h2>
              Implementation
            </h2>

            <p>First of all, let's define a callback that handles the <span>/start</span> command.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def get_usage():
&nbsp;&nbsp;return '''This bot allows you to query news articles from Datanews API.

Available commands:
/help, /start - show this help message.
/search &lt;query&gt; - retrieve news articles containing &lt;query&gt;.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: "/search covid"
/publisher &lt;domain&gt; - retrieve newest articles by publisher.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: "/publisher techcrunch.com"'''

def help_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_markdown(get_usage())
</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>As you can see, the implementation closely resembles our bot example above - we simply return the help information to our user. You can notice that our bot will support four commands. The <span>help_command</span> function implements the first two of them. Let's now discuss the other two.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def search_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;def fetcher(query):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return datanews.headlines(query, size=10, sortBy='date', page=0, language='en')
&nbsp;&nbsp;_fetch_data(update, context, fetcher)


def publisher_command(update, context):
&nbsp;&nbsp;def fetcher(query):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return datanews.headlines(source=query, size=10, sortBy='date', page=0, language='en')
&nbsp;&nbsp;_fetch_data(update, context, fetcher)</code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>These functions look very similar. They both use the <span>/headlines</span> API endpoint as discussed earlier (we are using the official
              <a href="https://github.com/DatanewsOrg/datanews-python">Datanews library for Python here</a>). They both delegate their work to a helper <span>_fetch_data</span>. The only difference is in the arguments we pass to the Datanews API: <span>search_command</span> retrieves articles matching a certain query whereas <span>publisher_command</span> fetches all articles as long as they are published by a specific source. Note, however, that in both cases we only get the first 10 most recent articles.</p>

            <p>Let's now take a look at the helper that does all the job.</p>

            <div>
              <pre><code>def _fetch_data(update, context, fetcher):
&nbsp;&nbsp;if not context.args:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help_command(update, context)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return

&nbsp;&nbsp;query = '"' + ' '.join(context.args) + '"'
&nbsp;&nbsp;result = fetcher(query)

&nbsp;&nbsp;if not result['hits']:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update.message.reply_text('No news is good news')
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return

&nbsp;&nbsp;last_message = update.message
&nbsp;&nbsp;for article in reversed(result['hits']):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text = article['title'] + ': ' + article['url']

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-swiftype-name="body" data-swiftype-type="text"><p>All around the world, companies are asking the same question: What is happening <em>right now</em>? We are inundated with pieces of data that have a fragment of the answer. But by the time we have assembled them into one clear view, the answer often no longer matters. It is too late.</p>
<p>Stateful stream processing is the way to beat the clock. It’s a programming paradigm that can materialize views of data in real time. What does that mean? It means you ask questions whose answers are incrementally updated as new information arrives. The effect is that your queries will always be fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://ksqldb.io/">ksqlDB</a>, the event streaming database, makes it easy to build real-time materialized views with Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup>. But how does it work? <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-stream-processing-works-with-ksqldb/">Part 1</a> of this series looked at how stateless operations work. Now we will take a look at stateful ones. If you like, you can follow along by executing the example code yourself. <a href="https://ksqldb.io/quickstart.html">ksqlDB’s quickstart</a> makes it easy to get up and running.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="materializing-a-view-from-a-stream"><a id="materializing-a-view-from-a-stream"></a>Materializing a view from a stream</h2>
<p>The goal of a materialized view is simple: Make a pre-aggregated, read-optimized version of your data so that queries do less work when they run. Imagine a toll-booth worker that collects fees from cars as they drive by. When the worker wants to know how much money is in the register, there are two different ways to find out. The worker can, of course, count every bill each time. But another way is to maintain a running total, by remembering the current amount, and periodically adding new driver fees.</p>
<p>When does this read-optimized version of your data get built? In a traditional database, you have to trigger it to happen. And when you do, the triggered updates can be slow because every change since the last trigger needs to be integrated. The materialized views might even need to be rebuilt from scratch, which can take a lot of time.</p>
<p>In stream processing, maintenance of the view is automatic and incremental. The view updates as soon as new events arrive and is adjusted in the smallest possible manner based on the delta rather than recomputed from scratch. That is why we say stream processing gives you <em>real-time</em> materialized views. It would be like the toll-worker adding to the running sum immediately after each driver’s fee is collected.</p>
<p>If you had a stream of sensor data:</p>
<pre><code>
CREATE STREAM readings (
    sensor VARCHAR KEY,
    area VARCHAR,
    reading INT
) WITH (
    kafka_topic = 'readings',
    partitions = 2,
    value_format = 'json'
);</code></pre>
<p>Whose events looked like:</p>
<pre><code>
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-1', 'wheel', 45);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'motor', 41);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-1', 'wheel', 92);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'engine', 13);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-2', 'engine', 90);

INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-4', 'motor', 95);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-3', 'engine', 67);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-3', 'wheel', 52);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-4', 'engine', 55);
INSERT INTO readings (sensor, area, reading) VALUES ('sensor-3', 'engine', 37);</code></pre>
<p>You might want to frequently check the current average of each sensor. You can do that by materializing a view of the stream:</p>
<pre><code>
-- process from the beginning of each stream
SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';

CREATE TABLE avg_readings AS
    SELECT sensor,
           AVG(reading) AS avg
    FROM readings
    GROUP BY sensor
    EMIT CHANGES;</code></pre>
<p>What happens when you run this statement on ksqlDB? Its server (we’re just looking at a single node in this post—in a future one we’ll look at how this works when ksqlDB is clustered) creates a new persistent query that runs forever, processing data as it arrives. When each row is read from the <code>readings</code> stream, the persistent query does two things. First, it incrementally updates the materialized view to integrate the incoming row. Second, it emits a row to a <em>changelog</em> topic. The changelog is an audit trail of all updates made to the materialized view, which we’ll see is handy both functionally and architecturally. Here is what that process looks like:</p>

<p>Pause the animation at any point and note the relationship between the materialized view (yellow box) and the changelog, hovering over the rows in the changelog to see their contents. The current values in the materialized views are the <em>latest</em> values per key in the changelog. For example, notice how the first and third events in partition <code>0</code> of the changelog are for key <code>sensor-1</code>. The third event is a <em>refinement</em> of the first event—the reading changed from <code>45</code> to <code>68.5</code>. That refinement causes the average for <code>sensor-1</code> to be updated incrementally by factoring in only the new data</p>
<p>A materialized view is only as good as the queries it serves, and ksqlDB gives you two ways to do it: push and pull queries. Both are issued by client programs to bring materialized view data into applications. Pull queries retrieve results at a point in time (namely “now”). If you run a query such as <code>SELECT * FROM readings WHERE sensor='sensor-1';</code>, the result will be whatever is in the materialized view when it executes. You can explore what that pull query would return by sliding around the progress bar of the animation and inspecting the table below it. By contrast, push queries stream a subscription of query result changes of the query result to the client as they occur. If you run <code>SELECT * FROM readings WHERE sensor='sensor-1' EMIT CHANGES;</code>, each of the rows in the changelog with key <code>sensor-1</code> will be continuously streamed to your application (<code>45</code> and <code>68.5</code>, respectively, in this example).</p>
</div>
<p>Beyond the programming abstraction, what is actually going on under the hood? When ksqlDB begins executing the persistent query, it leverages RocksDB to store the materialized view locally on its disk. RocksDB is an embedded key/value store that runs in process in each ksqlDB server—you do not need to start, manage, or interact with it. RocksDB is used to store the materialized view because it takes care of all the details of storing and indexing an associative data structure on disk with high performance.</p>
<p>ksqlDB server creates one RocksDB instance <em>per partition</em> of its immediate input streams. This per-partition isolation is an architectural advantage when ksqlDB runs as a cluster, but it does have one important implication—all rows that you want to be aggregated together must reside on the same partition of the incoming stream. What happens if that isn’t the case?</p>
<div>
<h2 id="automatic-repartitioning"><a id="automatic-repartitioning"></a>Automatic repartitioning</h2>
<p>There are many clauses that a materialized view statement can be created with, but perhaps the most common is <code>GROUP BY</code>. In a relational database, <code>GROUP BY</code> buckets rows according to some criteria before an aggregation executes. If it is a distributed database, data may need to be moved between nodes so that the node executing the operation has all the data it needs locally. As in relational databases, so in ksqlDB. ksqlDB repartitions your streams to ensure that all rows that have the same key reside on the same partition. This happens invisibility through a second, automatic stage of computation:</p>

<p>In distributed systems, the process of reorganizing data locality is known as <em>shuffling</em>. Kafka Streams, ksqlDB’s underlying execution engine, uses Kafka topics to shuffle intermediate data. These implementation-level topics are usually named <code>*-repartition</code> and are created, managed, and purged on your behalf. Repartition topics for materialized views have the same number of partitions as their source topics. When records are shuffled across partitions, the overall order of data from each original partition is no longer guaranteed. This is important to consider when you initially load data into Kafka. In general, it is always wise to avoid a shuffle in any system if you can, since there is inherent I/O involved.</p>
<p>If your data is already partitioned according to the <code>GROUP BY</code> criteria, the repartitioning is skipped. This is one of the huge advantages of ksqlDB’s strong type system on top of Kafka. Optimizations can be inferred from the schema of your data, and unnecessary I/O can be transparently omitted. You don’t need to remember to do these things; they simply happen for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="replaying-from-changelogs"><a id="replaying-from-changelogs"></a>Replaying from changelogs</h2>
<p>The architecture described so far supports a myriad of materializations, but what happens when a hardware fault causes you to permanently lose the ksqlDB server node? RocksDB is an embedded key/value store. It has no replication support to create secondary copies over a network. In other words, RocksDB is treated as a transient resource. When you lose ksqlDB’s server, you also lose RocksDB. Is that a problem?</p>
<p>It turns out that it isn’t. Remember that every time a materialized view updates, the persistent query maintaining it also writes out a row to a changelog topic. Each row contains the value that the materialized view was updated to. When a fresh ksqlDB server comes online and is assigned a stateful task (like a <code>SUM()</code> aggregation query), it checks to see whether it has any relevant data in RocksDB for that materialized view. If it doesn’t, it <em>replays</em> the changelog data directly into its RocksDB store. When it reaches the end, its local materialized view is up to date, and it can begin serving queries.</p>

<p>The process is the same even if the server boots up and has some prior RocksDB data. When ksqlDB is run as a cluster, another server may have taken over in its place. A ksqlDB server coming online with stale data in RocksDB can simply replay the part of the changelog that is new, allowing it to rapidly recover to the current state.</p>
<p>People often ask where exactly a materialized view is stored. It is, in fact, stored in two places, each of which is optimized for a different usage pattern. It is stored once in RocksDB on ksqlDB’s server in its materialized form for fast access. …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>While this expression may work for a mathematician, it can be a little overwhelming for other audiences. In this post I’ll provide an alternate rigorous, <em>programmatic</em>, definition of the multivariate gaussian in Python. We’ll then be able to use our mental Python interpreter to get intuition about the behavior of any multivariate gaussian.</p>
<p>I will assume familiarity with the following concepts.</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>single</em> dimensional gaussian, aka the normal random variable</li>
<li>expectation and covariance of random variables</li>
<li>vector and matrix operations, such as multiplication, and transpose</li>
<li>basic Python and numpy notation</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll also need the concept of <em>simulation</em>. I’ll say that a function <em>f</em> simulates a random variable <em>F</em> if there is no way to determine, given a list of outputs, whether the list was generated by repeated function calls to <em>f</em> or whether it came from independent realizations of <em>F</em>.</p>
<p>Now we’re ready to give a computational definition of an <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dimensional multivariate gaussian.  </p>
<p>Examine this simple program.</p>

<p>Now let’s break down what <code>x(mu, M)</code> does.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill an n-dimensional vector with independent standard random normals by calling <code>z()</code>.</li>
<li>Then multiply the result by matrix <code>M</code>.</li>
<li>Then shift the result by <code>mu</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This computational viewpoint is especially useful if <code>M</code> has a geometrical interpretation. For example, suppose we are working in two dimensions <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n = 2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If we graph the two columns of <code>M</code>, we can get a picture of how it warps the plane. </p>

<p>Successive calls to <code>z()</code> will generate a cloud of samples around the origin, with the cloud getting denser as we get closer to the origin. If we draw a circle around this cloud and multiply all points in the plane by <code>M</code>, we can see that we get a cloud in an elliptical shape.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the mean <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is <code>mu</code>. We could have guessed that by looking at the illustrations above.  </p>
<p>Now let’s compute the covariance. But first a clarification about notation. Consider that <code>np.matmul(z(), z().T)</code> calls <code>z</code> <em>twice</em> and therefore generates two independent versions of <code>z</code>. How do we declare that we want the <em>same</em> sample of <code>z</code> both times? We can use an immediately invoked <code>lambda</code> expression <code>(lambda Z: np.matmul(Z Z.T))(z())</code>. (You might have seen this elsewhere called the IIFE pattern.) Okay we’re ready to compute the covariance.</p>

<p><strong>Result 1.</strong> If <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a gaussian simulated by <code>x(mu, M)</code>, it has mean <code>mu</code> and covariance <code>M M.T</code>.</p>
<p>It’s actually more likely you’ll need to go <em>backwards.</em> For example, if you encounter a multivariate gaussian in the wild with the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> parameterization and you need want to visualize it as an ellipsoid using the <code>mu, M</code> parameterization. For that we usually use the <em>eigendecomposition</em> <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>Q</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">Λ</mi><msup><mi>Q</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma = Q \Lambda Q^T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>
<p>This decomposition is extremely important in linear algebra, and I would encourage you to read up on it later. If we start with any covariance matrix <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the eigendecomposition has the following properties.</p>

<p>The Hypi team is incredibly proud to announce today that we’re making our second <a href="https://hypi.app/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public beta available today</a>.</p>
<p>This has been in the making for a few months after receiving very valuable feedback from our community. Not only have we listened to the original feedback, some members of our community have directly contributed to the improvements in this release.</p>

<p>Three years ago our team set out to make it easier for developers to build applications but we had no idea of the amazing journey this would take us on. In our first 18 months we built 3 different versions and threw them all away because they just weren’t quite right. We spoke to developers at conferences and meetups including WebSummit, Collision and Apache Ignite London and France. It was 18 months researching and speaking to developers 6 countries face to face and 4 more virtually all of this has culminated into what Hypi is today.</p>

<p>Several months ago we offered limited access and got feedback from the wider community. That feedback was reassuring, almost everyone felt it was a good product with great potential but were missing a few things or could be improved here and there and now we’re again announcing Hypi, a comprehensive low-code backend as a service platform.</p>

<p>Hypi’s founding purpose is to make development simple and hair-loss free. We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to do that best and we summised a few things from our own experience as well as from our research and speaking to developers.</p>
<ol><li>We spend too much time repeating ourselves from project to project, sometimes even within the same project. The things that almost everyone we spoke to say they repeat a lot are:<ol><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/crud" target="_blank">CRUD APIs</a> – the bare bones of all data driven applications</li><li>Authentication – Registration and login in</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/authorisation" target="_blank">Authorisation</a> – Access control, even more than that, <strong>flexible</strong> access control. Role based access control is great but simply doesn’t fit the bill in many cases.</li><li>Caching and scaling – even today, this remains a challenge for most developers</li></ol></li><li>We spend so much time integrating and <a href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/api-gateway" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staying in sync with external services</a>.</li><li>We still have to build what are now commonplace features into our apps every time.</li></ol>
<p>The team’s very proud to say that Hypi takes care of all of these and so much more.</p>
<p>Available today are features such as:</p>
<ol><li>Instantly generating CRUD APIs from a data model</li><li>Automatically available login and registration APIs</li><li>A simple, yet flexible authorisation API allowing you to model anything from simple role based access control to complex corporate authorisation models</li><li>Hypi is built on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ignite.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Ignite</a> allowing us to automatically scale your APIs, no effort required. Taking advantage of its massively scalable in-memory technology we’re also able to achieve incredible performance, thinking nothing of it!</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/serverless-functions" target="_blank">Serverless functions</a> so you can add custom APIs and extend the built in ones.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/user-defined-functions" target="_blank">Inline functions</a> for when Docker containers are too heavy handed</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/webhooks" target="_blank">Webhooks</a> to accept incoming, unauthenticated events from external systems</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/workflow" target="_blank">Workflows</a> for scheduling and orchestrating function executions</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/math-api" target="_blank">Math APIs</a> for performing atomic mathematical operations server side</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/references/aggregations-api" target="_blank">Aggregations API</a> for getting analytics and other insights from your data</li><li>A powerful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/tutorials/arcql" target="_blank">query/filtering language</a> to find data</li><li>…and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.hypi.app/" target="_blank">so much more</a> </li></ol>
<p>When we say it’s a comprehensive platform, we mean it. For our existing users who have been working closely with us to get to this stage we thank you! This announcement signals our push towards general availability in the coming months. </p>
<p><a href="https://hypi.app/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up and let Hypi</a> take the stress and repetition out of back end development. Simple is best!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f99dfb0a1f04e2577108899ca48dca03f49f0d67/039b8/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/gardening-growing.jpg"></p><p>I’ve been using Twitter for almost 12 years now. It can be challenging to navigate your timeline, so today I’m sharing some tips to keep it fun.</p><p>This is the first part of my Twitter series about Gardening Your Twitter. Don’t miss out on the second part, where you can learn how to best <a href="https://steipete.com/posts/curating-your-twitter-timeline/">curate your timeline</a> and manage who to follow and unfollow.</p><h2 id="your-online-persona">Your Online Persona</h2><p>There are many strategies for online personas, but I can only share what works well for me. I follow people to cover specific areas/topics and also for their commentary/personality. In a way, Twitter is a newsfeed where the comments are presented before the content, and you pick people for both content and comments.</p><p>I’m known for talking about iOS and bootstrapping a company, and I have a pretty sharp tongue on tech news. I used to keep politics out of my feed, but since 2016, I do sprinkle in topics that are important to me — from US politics to climate change and LGBTQIA rights.</p><p>There will always be people who complain that XY topic shouldn’t be on Twitter, but in the end, it’s <em>your choice</em> what you talk about and it’s their choice to follow you.</p><p>I’m openly gay on Twitter, but only in the last few years have I also started talking about that. Being open does allow me to add a unique perspective to some content, and it adds more complexity to my persona. I almost never share pictures or private content though; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sportg33k/">that stuff is for Instagram</a>.</p><p>Whatever you go with, be authentic. I don’t share everything on Twitter, but what I do share is honest and is usually done with passion. Additionally, it can be interesting or funny. I do not share content for money or for favors, rather I only share things if I find them interesting.</p><h3 id="your-avatar">Your Avatar</h3><p>Pick an avatar you like and stick with it. I recommend a real face and not a sketch or something more abstract, as it’ll help folks identify you at conferences or events. Make sure you use the same picture and use it everywhere (GitHub, Gravatar, email, etc.) so that you have one universal online identity. People will scan the picture much faster than your name — changing it is usually something folks dislike, and it’ll result in a temporary loss of engagement. You can change it, but I recommend not doing that, or at least doing so only every few years.</p><p>Or, you can be really sneaky and just <a href="https://krausefx.com/blog/continuous-delivery-for-your-profile-picture">remake your picture so it changes slightly every year</a>.</p><h3 id="direct-messages">Direct Messages</h3><p>I highly recommend going into Settings and privacy &gt; Privacy and safety &gt; Direct Messages and enabling “Receive messages from anyone.” There’s a lot of great commentary from people that I received via DM since they’re not comfortable replying publicly. There are the occasional odd messages (and inappropriate offers), but if you’re a cis white male, you likely are good. Minority groups might want to reconsider this setting or at least enable the Quality filter.</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/863f9afff497ec9faee70ce7485680fbc999fde1/a1446/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/settings.png" alt="Twitter Settings"></p><p>If in doubt, I suggest you experiment with this — the settings are easy to change if it turns out to be a bad idea.</p><h3 id="multiple-profiles">Multiple Profiles</h3><p>Quite a few of my friends have “alt” accounts for the hot takes or for talking with friends. If you work at a Big Corp, you might be required to filter what you say, and having an alt can be a solution. In general, I don’t recommend making an alt account, as it’s simply too much work to maintain multiple accounts. Just tweet out your hot takes and attract the right followers on your main account.</p><h2 id="extending-reach">Extending Reach</h2><p>The more active followers you have on Twitter, the more fun it becomes. There’s no hack or shortcut for gaining followers, but there are various things you can do that can help you steadily grow your audience.</p><h3 id="blog-posts">Blog Posts</h3><p>Twitter is a great indicator for topics that people find interesting — <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1297956386836566016">I often get my best ideas for blog posts out of Twitter conversations</a>, and I also already have half the content there. Twitter is great for inspiration and to learn, but it’s often hard to read and follow conversations. Go the extra mile and convert some of these interactions to blog posts. This will greatly extend your reach, and in turn, it’ll attract new followers who find your content interesting.</p><h3 id="conference-talks">Conference Talks</h3><p><a href="https://steipete.tv/">Speaking at conferences</a> is a great way to meet new people and extend your social circle. I often meet folks at conferences, and either we connect on Twitter or we find out that we already know each other on there! Either way — this will increase the bond and will make it more likely that people reach out to you. <strong>Conferences are work, but they are so worth it.</strong></p><p>Bonus: <a href="https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2018/binary-frameworks-swift/">Convert your conference talk to a blog post</a>. Very few people will actually watch a recording, so via recycling and reshaping content you already have, you can extend your reach again.</p><p>If you plan on starting to speak, create a website where you list what topics you can talk about and your bio. I’m using <a href="https://github.com/steipete/speaking">a simple GitHub repo</a> that has been proven extremely useful for me to track past events, attract new speaking gigs, and help conference organizers with getting the information they need to announce me.</p><h3 id="engage-with-your-audience">Engage with Your Audience</h3><p>I try to reply to almost everyone who interacts with me on Twitter. This doesn’t take much time, and sometimes I just reply with an emoji, but taking time to engage shows your audience you care, and they’re much more likely to interact with your content again if they know that it’s not a one-way street. Same goes for your feed — don’t just read, reply. This can range from helping others with questions/problems to just posting a “me too” retweet. Sometimes I get content in my feed via a retweet, and by interacting with that, I get a new follower.</p><h3 id="tracking-statistics">Tracking Statistics</h3><p>Be consistent. You won’t grow an audience overnight. Make Twitter a daily thing. Share content. Be present — and you’ll grow your audience every day.</p><p><a href="https://analytics.twitter.com/">Twitter Analytics</a> is great to understand which tweets work. To track long-term performance, I’m using <a href="http://birdbrainapp.com/">Birdbrain</a>. It’s one of the oldest apps on my phone, so I have data since 2014. Interestingly, my follower count has been growing pretty much linearly:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/b753fb6d7ed16ff2e572edcc90d8143bf73653eb/38f85/assets/img/2020/make-twitter-work/follower.png" alt="Birdbrain Follower Count of @steipete" width="50%"></p><h2 id="tweets-that-work">Tweets that Work</h2><p>I do share a lot of news articles. I often just quote something interesting from the news if it doesn’t need strong commentary, but the inclusion of a pull quote helps show that it’s worth reading.</p><p>The tweets that are the most engaging, however, usually are original content, particularly in context with your audience and topics of interest. Here are some of my top performing tweets from the last few months, with about 80K–450K impressions each.

<p>I’ve <a href="https://davemateer.com/2019/07/28/Jekyll-Github-Pages">written a lot about using Jekyll</a> using Docker from Windows to get a good experience. However it can be slow to regenerate and update itself which is annoying.</p>

<p><a href="https://davemateer.com/2020/10/20/WSL2">Here are my brief notes on setting up WSL2 on Win 10</a></p>

<p><a href="https://davemateer.com/2020/10/20/windows-terminal">Here is setting up the new Windows Terminal to connect to WSL2</a></p>

<p>Below is my shot of running WSL2 and Jekyll.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR - it works really well</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/2020/05/19/jekyll-on-wsl2.html">Dylan Beattie’s article</a> and this <a href="https://medium.com/@hjgraca/using-wsl2-visual-studio-code-for-jekyll-blogging-on-windows-10-99489deb4650">Medium article</a> helped me along the way.</p>

<p>However I got errors like this following along with the Medium article:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ERROR:  Error installing zlib:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
extconf failed, <span>exit </span>code 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After some playing around this worked for me:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get update <span>-y</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>sudo </span>apt-get upgrade <span>-y</span>

<span>sudo </span>apt <span>install </span>ruby-full

<span>sudo </span>gem update

<span>sudo </span>gem <span>install </span>bundler

<span>sudo </span>apt-get <span>install </span>make gcc gpp build-essential zlib1g zlib1g-dev ruby-dev dh-autoreconf

<span>sudo </span>gem <span>install </span>jekyll

<span># inside jekyll repo</span>
<span>sudo </span>bundle <span>install</span>

<span># simple serve</span>
bundle <span>exec </span>jekyll serve

<span># I like to have reload working</span>
bundle <span>exec </span>jekyll serve force_polling <span>--livereload</span> <span>--unpublished</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m running Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS which I found out by typing this into bash:</p>



<h2 id="vscode---remote-wsl">VSCode - Remote WSL</h2>

<p>To easily view and edit files inside WSL2</p>

<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl">Remote - WSL extension</a></p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Perf went from 35 seconds to 10 seconds</p>

<p><img src="https://davemateer.com/assets/2020-10-19/perf.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Performance is still quite slow for me">]</p>

<p>After my laptop was left for a while this went down to around <strong>7 seconds - wow!</strong></p>

<h2 id="windows-explorer">Windows Explorer</h2>

<p>I take screenshots and use images from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash</a> so I need an easy way to save to the WSL2 filesystem. From windows explorer address bar I typed in:</p>

<pre><code>\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\dave\djhmateer.github.io
</code></pre>

<p>Then put it in my Quick Access:</p>

<p><img src="https://davemateer.com/assets/2020-10-19/quick.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Quick access">]</p>

<h2 id="shortcuts-in-bash_aliases">Shortcuts in .bash_aliases</h2>

<p><a href="https://davemateer.com/2020/10/20/windows-terminal">Windows Terminal blog post</a> where I drive things from now, includes all my useful alias shortcuts.</p>

<h2 id="mount-a-disk">Mount a disk</h2>

<p>If you’ve got <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/09/10/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-20211/">Windows 10 Inside Preview Build 20211</a> you can mount a disk easily. To save images into WSL2 from Windows side, lets <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/access-linux-filesystems-in-windows-and-wsl-2/">mount a disk</a></p>

<p>I don’t have this build, so have stuck with the Windows explorer quick access way which seems to work for me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’m convinced and love having a faster regeneration of my site again.</p>

<p>At some point I will have to look at my Jekyll site and do some performance optimisations to make it regenerate faster.</p>

<p><a href="https://davemateer.com/2019/07/28/Jekyll-Github-Pages">Here is my current technical way I structure my Jekyll site</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No7dtPtbtcE">A great video on Jekyll with tips on keeping it simple</a></p>

<p>In the meantime I can get on with writing and easily seeing live previews.</p>

<p>Happy blogging :-)</p>

October 21, 2020 | https://blog.pixielabs.ai/blog/hybrid-architecture/hybrid-architecture/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.pixielabs.ai/blog/hybrid-architecture/hybrid-architecture/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>At Pixie, we are working on a Kubernetes native monitoring system which stores and processes the resulting data entirely within a user’s cluster. This is the first in a series of posts discussing techniques and best practices for effectively building Kubernetes native applications. In this post, we explore the trade-offs between using an air-gapped deployment that lives completely within a cluster and a system which splits the control and data planes between the cloud and cluster, respectively.  </p><p>One benefit of building for the Kubernetes platform is that it simplifies the process of deploying applications to a user’s environment, often requiring only a few simple steps such as applying a set of YAMLs or installing a Helm Chart. Within minutes, users can easily have a running version of the application on their cluster. However, now that these applications are running entirely on prem, it becomes difficult for the developer to manage. In many cases, rolling out major updates or bug fixes relies on having the user manually update their deployment. This is unreliable for the developer and burdensome for the user.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/e4ba6d3f5793c83a25a64e4fba9e2981/connected-on-prem.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of a connected on-prem architecture.</figcaption></figure></div><p>To address this problem, we propose a connected on-prem architecture which delegates the responsibility of managing the data and control planes of the application to the deployment running in the cluster and a developer-managed cloud environment, respectively. More concretely, the application deployed in the user’s cluster is solely responsible for collecting data and making that data accessible. Once the foundation of this data layer is established, the logic remains mostly stable and is infrequently updated. Meanwhile, a cloud-hosted system manages the core functionality and orchestration of the application. As the cloud is managed by the developer themselves, they are freely able to perform updates without any dependency on the users. This allows the developer to iterate quickly on the functionality of their system, all while maintaining data locality on prem.</p><p>This split-responsibility architecture is common in many hardware products, since external factors may make it challenging to deploy updates to software running on physical devices. For instance, despite these physical limitations, <a href="https://www.ui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiqiti</a>’s UI is able to offer a rich feature-set by delegating functionality to their cloud and keeping their physical routers within the data plane. Similarly, <a href="https://webrtc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebRTC</a> is a standard built into most modern browsers for handling voice and video data. Although browser updates are infrequent, having the separated data and control layers allows developers to freely build a diverse set of applications on top of WebRTC. This architecture is still relatively uncommon in enterprise software, but has been adopted by popular products such as <a href="https://harness.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/arch_2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harness</a>, <a href="https://streamsets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamsets</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/anthos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthos</a>.</p><p>However, designing a connected on-prem architecture is easier said than done. When building such a system, one challenge you may encounter is how to query data from an application running on the user’s cluster via a UI hosted in the cloud. We explore two approaches for doing so:</p><ol><li>Making requests directly to the application in the cluster</li><li>Proxying requests through the cloud</li></ol><p>For brevity, we will refer to the application running on the user’s cluster as a satellite.</p><h2>Approach 1: Making Requests Directly to the Application in the Cluster</h2><p>The simplest approach for executing the query on a satellite is to have the UI make the request directly to the satellite itself. To do this, the UI must be able to get the (1) status and (2) address of the satellite from the cloud, so that it knows whether the satellite is available for querying and where it should make requests to. </p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/eb62b05f17165493ca6c988177555267/non-passthrough.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of Non-Passthrough Mode where the UI makes requests directly to the satellite agent itself.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Step 1: Heartbeating</h3><p>A common technique to track the status of a program is to establish a heartbeat sequence between the program (the satellite) and the monitoring system (the cloud). This is typically done by having the satellite first send a registration message to the cloud. During registration, the satellite either provides an identifier or is assigned an identifier via the cloud, which is used to identify the satellite in subsequent heartbeat messages.</p><p>Following registration, the satellite begins sending periodic heartbeats to the cloud to indicate it is alive and healthy. Additional information can be sent in these heartbeats. In our case, we also attach the satellite’s IP address. Alternatively, the IP address could have been sent during registration, if it is not subject to change. The cloud records the satellite’s status and address so that it can be queried by the UI.</p><p>Now, when the UI wants to make a request to a satellite, it first queries the cloud for the address, then directly makes the request to that address. </p><p>Great! That wasn’t too bad. In many cases, many cloud/distributed satellite architectures already communicate via heartbeats to track satellite state, so sending an additional address is no problem. However... If your UI is running on a browser and your satellite is responding over HTTPS (likely with self-signed certs), you are not done yet...</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/f178e72484d5e1de0dcc20d539cd25d6/cert-authority-invalid-1.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><h3>Step 2: Assigning Satellites a Domain Name</h3><p>The browser is blocking our requests because of the satellite’s SSL certs! A user could go ahead and navigate directly to the satellite’s address, where the browser prompts the user with whether or not they want to bypass the invalid cert.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2473c1e3bd36f293ccf4938cd7d1b4f4/cert-authority-invalid-2.png"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>However, this would need to be done per satellite and is disruptive to the user’s overall experience. It is possible to generate SSL certs for IP addresses, but this is uncommon and isn’t available with most free Certificate Authorities. This approach is also complicated if the satellite’s IP address is subject to change. </p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/16755003b378767879ee5d066ff07608/SSL-cert-flow.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of SSL certification flow for Non-Passthrough Mode.</figcaption></figure></div><p>To solve this problem, we used the following solution:</p><ol><li>Pre-generate SSL certs under a subdomain that you control, for instance: <code>&lt;uuid&gt;.satellites.yourdomain.com</code>. This step is easy to do with any free Certificate Authority <em>and can be safely done if the subdomain has a well-known DNS address</em>. You should make sure to generate more SSL certs than the number of expected satellites. </li><li>When an satellite registers with the cloud, it should be assigned an unused SSL cert and associated subdomain. The SSL cert should be securely sent to the satellite and the satellite’s proxy should be updated to use the new cert.</li><li>When the cloud receives the satellite’s IP address from its heartbeats, it updates the DNS record for the satellite’s subdomain to point to the IP address. </li><li>When executing queries, the UI can now safely make requests to the satellite’s assigned subdomain rather than directly to its IP address, all with valid certs!</li></ol><p>In the end, making requests directly to the satellites turned out to be more complicated (and hacky) than we’d originally thought. The solution also doesn’t scale well, since the SSL certs need to be pre-generated. Without having a fixed number of satellites, or an upperbound on the number of satellites, it isn’t long before all the certs have been assigned and someone needs to step in and manually generate more. It is possible to generate the certs and their DNS records on the fly, but we’ve found these operations can take too long to propagate to all networks. <em>It is also important to note that this approach may violate the terms of service for automated SSL generation and is susceptible to usual security risks of wildcard certificates.</em></p><p>When a satellite is behind a firewall, it will only be queryable by users within the network. This further ensures that no sensitive data leaves the network.</p><h2>Approach 2: Proxying Queries through the Server</h2><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/2aea205714b53dd0286e660bec0c9370/passthrough-general.svg"><figcaption>Diagram of Passthrough Mode where UI requests are proxied through the cloud.</figcaption></figure></div><p>As seen in the previous approach, it is easiest to have the UI make requests to the cloud to avoid any certificate errors. However, we still want the actual query execution to be handled by the satellites themselves. To solve this, we architected another approach which follows these general steps:</p><ol><li>User initiates query via the UI.</li><li>The cloud forwards the query to the appropriate satellite.</li><li>Satellite send its responses back to the cloud.</li><li>Cloud forwards responses back to the UI.</li></ol><p>The cloud must be able to handle multiple queries to many different satellites at once. A satellite will stream batches of data in response, which the server needs to send to the correct requestor. With so many messages flying back and forth, all of which need to be contained within their own request/reply channels, we thought this would be the perfect job for a message bus. </p><p>The next question was: which message bus should we use? </p><h3>Choosing a Message Bus</h3><p>We built up a list of criteria that we wanted our message bus to fulfill: </p><ul><li>It should receive and send messages quickly, especially since there is a user waiting at the receiving end.</li><li>It should be able to handle relatively large messages. An satellite’s query response can be batched into many smaller messages, but the size of a single datapoint can still be non-trivial.</li><li>Similarly, since an satellite’s response may be batched into many messages, the message bus should be able to handle a large influx of messages at any given time.</li><li>It should be easy to start new channels at any time. We may want to create a new channel per request or per satellite, all of which we have no fixed number.</li></ul><p>We briefly considered Google Pub/Sub, which had strict quota requirements (only 10,000 topics per Google project), and other projects such as Apache Pulsar. However, we primarily considered two messaging systems: Apache Kafka and NATS. General comparisons between Kafka and NATS have been discussed at length in other blogs. In this blog post, we aim to compare these two systems based on our requirements above.</p><p>We relied heavily on benchmarks that <a href="https://bravenewgeek.com/category/benchmarking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others have performed</a> to judge latency based on message size and message volume. These results lean in …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>mTCP is a set of TCP/IP applications for personal computers running
PC-DOS, MS-DOS, FreeDOS, and other flavors of DOS. The applications
include:<br>
</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_DHCP.html">DHCP</a>: a DHCP client for
auto-configuring your machine for use on your network.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_FTP.html">FTP</a>: an FTP client for
transferring files across the network at high speed.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_FTPSrv.html">FTPSRV</a>: a high performance FTP
server that allows multiple connected clients, a sandbox
area for untrusted users, etc.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_HTGet.html">HTGET</a>: the HTGet program
for downloading files/content from web (HTTP) servers</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_HTTPServ.html">HTTPSERV</a>: an HTTP server
supporting HTTP 0.9, 1.0, 1.1<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/IRCjr.html">IRCJR</a>: the IRCjr IRC (Internet Relay
Chat)
client for chatting on IRC networks.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Netcat.html">NC</a>: the Netcat command
which can be used to send and receive data easily across a network.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Ping.html">PING</a>: the Ping command for
checking basic network connectivity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_PktTool.html">PKTTOOL</a>: A packet sniffer and
diagnostic tool for packet drivers<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Sntp.html">SNTP</a>: an SNTP client for getting
the current date and time from public
servers on the Internet.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Telnet.html">TELNET</a>: a Telnet client for
connecting to Unix systems, BBS systems, or any computer that supports
Telnet.</li>
</ul>

<p>mTCP runs on all variants of DOS including IBM PC-DOS,
Microsoft
MS-DOS, DR-DOS and FreeDOS. All of these applications will run well on
the oldest, slowest PC that you
can find - I routinely use them on an IBM PCjr made in 1983 because
nothing beats
the fun of putting a 35+ year old computer on the Internet.</p>

<p>People are using mTCP for goofing off and for real work. If
you have a DOS machine that needs to send data across the network mTCP
can help you get that done. Besides its utility to vintage computers I
have heard of people using it to transfer lab data from dedicated
industrial PCs, allowing backups to be run on old machines, and sending
sales reports from the branch offices of a retail store to a central
server.</p>

<p>Don't have a vintage computer laying around? No problem! mTCP
applications will run in a variety of virtual and emulated
environments. It has been tested with modified DOSBox builds,&nbsp;
VirtualBox, VMWare, and QEMU. See the documentation for the details.</p>



<p>mTCP applications should work on any IBM PC compatible personal
computer running
DOS. To be more specific:</p>

<ul>

  <li>An IBM PC compatible with an 8088 or better CPU</li>
  <li>96KB to 256KB of system memory depending on the application</li>
  <li>DOS 2.1 or newer</li>
  <li>A network card (Ethernet adapter, or a device emulating Ethernet)
that has a "packet driver" (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>
A packet driver is a utility that lets a program send and receive
Ethernet packets using your network card. The packet driver
specification is widely supported by both old and new
Ethernet cards. If your Ethernet card does not have a packet driver
available an NDIS or ODI driver with a "shim" to convert to the packet
specification should work but that will require more memory and be
slower
than having a real packet driver. SLIP and PPP connections are also
supported if they use a packet driver that emulates Ethernet. See <a href="http://crynwr.com/packet_driver.html">http://crynwr.com/packet_driver.html</a>
for more information on the packet driver specification.
</p>

<p>My personal testing includes:</p>

<p>Machines:</p>

<ul>

Hundreds (thousands?) of people are using mTCP on a diverse set of
hardware. If your machine runs DOS and you have a packet driver for
your Ethernet card, then mTCP will probably work for you.&nbsp; SLIP
and PPP are also supported via EtherSLIP, so any machine with a serial
port can work too.

<p>mTCP is a hobby project that I started in 2005. While it is only a
hobby project, I take
pride in my work. If you have a comment, bug, or suggestion for a
feature please email me at mbbrutman at gmail.com. I might ask for
further
information or a trace from the program you are having trouble with.
Your bug reports help me make mTCP better for everybody else.</p>

<p>If you need a change to make mTCP work better for you I am
interested in hearing your requirements. I am willing to write custom
code if needed, but instead of charging for that service I suggest
making a donation to a local animal shelter of your choice. (I have
never seen an over-funded animal shelter.) Contact me with what you
need and I'll see what I can do. (And thank you to those who have taken
me up on this offer!)<br>
</p>

</ul>

<p>Interested in seeing the source code that lets you talk
directly to a
packet driver? I have taken the lowest layer of the mTCP code and
packaged it
with a sample application that shows you how to interface a C program
with the software interrupt mechanism used by packet drivers. Check it
out here: <a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_tcpacket.html">mTCP_tcpacket.html</a></p>



<p><span></span>Jump in!&nbsp; See the mTCP
Programming Sample! <a href="http://brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Programming_Sample.html">http://brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Programming_Sample.html</a><br>
</p>

<p>All of the applications use the mTCP TCP/IP library which is
designed
for high performance even on small, slower machines. The code is
written in a combination of C++ and assembler. The style of coding is
more like "C with classes" to improve the structure of the code with
assembler being used in limited areas to improve the performance. The
source code is fairly well commented. You can look at
it as a framework for writing TCP/IP applications for DOS, complete
with plenty of examples.</p>

<p>Features include ARP, UDP, DNS, IP fragments, listen and
accept calls
for server applications, configurable buffer sizes, automatic
retransmit using Karne's algorithm, and run-time switchable tracing for
helping you debug. Features may be compiled in or out as needed so that
you can minimize the overhead of the TCP/IP library and include only
the features that you need. mTCP does not use floating point
operations, avoiding the code bloat of the floating point emulation
library.</p>

<p>mTCP is designed to be robust. DOS is a challenging
environment to work
in because quite frankly, it is not much of an operating system. mTCP
attempts to minimize problems by using defensive programming
techniques. Not every programming error can be prevented, but the
library tries to help you where it can. For example, to prevent
fragmentation in the DOS heap mTCP generally preallocates pools of
objects and manages the objects instead of repeatedly allocating and
freeing memory using the DOS heap. The FTP server and the IRC client
have been demonstrated to run for days without leaking memory or
crashing the machine.</p>

<p>High performance is a key feature of mTCP. The library is
written to
avoid excess memory copying wherever possible. Assembler is used on
some code for both performance and to avoid making expensive library
calls that will just invoke BIOS or DOS routines anyway. For the
ultimate in performance you can choose to handle raw packets directly
in your application layer code, or you can use higher level "send" and
"recv" type calls instead. The ability to adjust buffer sizes allows
you to balance speed versus memory footprint. Want to see how fast mTCP
is? Here are some performance measurements
for FTP and for raw socket performance: <a href="http://www.brutman.com/mTCP/mTCP_Performance.html">mTCP
Performance notes</a></p>

<p>mTCP is only available as a library that you link with your
application. A TSR version that can be used by software interrupt is
not available. While a TSR version would allow more programming
environments access to TCP/IP services, it is a much more difficult
environment to work in and debug. Performance would also suffer too. It
would be an interesting project though - if you want to collaborate on
the design for a TSR version of mTCP please contact me.</p>

<p>(For a TCP/IP stack that loads as a TSR see Trumpet by Peter Tattam.
Trumpet can usually be found by searching for TCPDRV or NTCPDRV. WATTCP
is an older, more widespread TCP/IP stack that can be used as an
alternative to mTCP. Neither Trumpet or WATTCP are actively
maintained.)</p>

<p>The very first version that we are releasing in November will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The famous distance strategy (most-cited)</li>
<li>Advanced distance measures</li>
<li>Co-integration tests</li>
<li>Kalman Filter</li>
<li>OU and XOU models + fitting</li>
<li>Optimal stopping and switching</li>
<li>Models to determine time-series properties</li>
<li>n-asset mean reverting portfolios</li>
<li>PCA technique</li>
</ol>
<p>Then in the months to follow we will add machine learning models to identify pairs, ARODs, and various ways to model and trade the spread. A lot of what we build next will be based on user feedback and the tools that they use the most.</p>
<p>The new library will start off as a monthly subscription service, with the python library being installed locally, so users can still view the source code and audit the techniques.</p>

I like it, I find the tool useful, and that’s that. But the great debate started over our lord and savior, <a href="https://yaml.org/">YAML</a>. Yeah, I know, XML vs. JSON vs. YAML vs. TOML vs. the next thing is a tired and old debate.</p><p>Let me level set here. I routinely joke about how I’m a “Calendar Driven YAML Engineer” and have been for years on <a href="https://openshift.tv/">openshift.tv</a>. But I’m not too fond of YAML. Let me tell you a story…</p><p>In 2012, I worked at McClatchy Interactive (before the really dark times) and enjoyed the systems and security work I was doing. We had our machine creation down to a finite science. Bare metal spun up, you punched the MAC address into a database file, and off the machine went to get all the needed packaging and code to run as its defined purpose in our infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFEngine">CFEngine</a> provisioned the machine accordingly based on purpose and positioned it in the network ready for code deployment. DevOps was something the company was embracing at the time. So instead of using the existing CFEngine infrastructure, the DevOps tandem at the time was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(company)">Puppet</a> for code deploys. This system worked fine until it didn’t. There were clear lines between infrastructure (typical IT in the datacenter) and software deployment and configuration (developers). In our case, DevOps represented the development team more so than the Operations team. Sound familiar?</p><p>But, as you can imagine, even with all the automation in place, it was still a throw over the wall kind of scenario. When Puppet needed system packages installed because of modifications to the codebase (requiring a newer version of Perl, for example) or new services coming online using different OS packages, Puppet now had to do the task CFEngine was doing; systems management. The idea was to build an overarching WebOps team that was cross-functional, spirited, and deeply technical. The first edict laid down to the team by the DevOps lead was, “read the <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML spec</a>.” We were all jumping into the Puppet pool to help integrate our processes and procedures better.</p><p>“Ugh…” I thought to myself. “I have to read this horribly written spec.” It was not an RFC, which I am fond of reading, but something about the YAML spec made me sad and frustrated. Syntax <em>really</em> mattered. Whitespace <em>really</em> mattered. My experiences have taught me that rote memorization and getting humans to see the absence of something were incredibly difficult tasks. These are things that most hackers take advantage of when infiltrating systems. Humans aren’t as good as computers at finding the absence of something or memorizing things. I was not too fond of this non-markup language for these reasons.</p><p>It irked me that the YAML creators laid out goal #1 as “YAML is easily readable by humans.” It is human-readable because you see the human-readable words in the scalars and structures, but there was something off-putting about YAML. It was a markup language claiming not to be a markup language. I held the firm belief that markup languages are supposed to make things simpler for humans, not harder (XML is the antithesis of markup languages, in my opinion).</p><p>Here I was, relatively fresh to the DevOps game, learning some core developer concepts to understand a markup language, the crux of which was two Achilles heels. I also didn’t like how big, bulky, and cumbersome Puppet was to work with. But, here I was thrust headfirst into this world. Might as well make the best of it. I’ve since embraced YAML, but it doesn’t mean I’m writing my notes in YAML format.</p><div><div id="sib-form-container"><div id="error-message"><div><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M256 40c118.621.0 216 96.075 216 216 0 119.291-96.61 216-216 216-119.244.0-216-96.562-216-216 0-119.203 96.602-216 216-216m0-32C119.043 8 8 119.083 8 256c0 136.997 111.043 248 248 248s248-111.003 248-248C504 119.083 392.957 8 256 8zm-11.49 120h22.979c6.823.0 12.274 5.682 11.99 12.5l-7 168c-.268 6.428-5.556 11.5-11.99 11.5h-8.979c-6.433.0-11.722-5.073-11.99-11.5l-7-168c-.283-6.818 5.167-12.5 11.99-12.5zM256 340c-15.464.0-28 12.536-28 28s12.536 28 28 28 28-12.536 28-28-12.536-28-28-28z"></path></svg><p><span>Your subscription could not be saved.

If Kubernetes is the platform of the future, that means we’ll be using a spec written in 2009 well into the 2030s (and likely beyond).</p><p>I hope that a drop in replacement is possible. The fact that we need tools like <a href="https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/">yq</a> does show that there is some work to be done when it comes to wrangling the YAML beast at scale. In 2009, when the latest version of the YAML spec was written, no one thought of applying pod security policies to massive Kubernetes deployments spread out across data centers the world over. Something better will come along and I hope adopting it isn’t as painful as adopting YAML is.</p><p>Remember, comparing things relatively to like something (YAML vs. XML or YAML vs. JSON) completely throws out the beginner’s journey. Start from the newb and go forward from there. YAML doesn’t. Git doesn’t. Incrementally, YAML is better than XML but, it sucks compared to something like HTML or Markdown (which I can teach to execs and children alike). Yes, balancing machine and human readability is hard. The compromises suck, but, at some point, there’s enough compute to run a process to take in something 100% human-readable and make it 100% machine-readable. In the same sense that compute has become so readily available that we gzip and encrypt almost all HTTP traffic today, I hope we can do the same with systems configuration languages. Move the complexity from the human to code. Computers are better at remembering things and syntax-semantics than humans could ever hope to be.</p><p>There’s always a happy medium between human and machine readability. However, I’d much rather see a human first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">80-20</a> approach here where entry-level skills can solve 80% of the markup language’s use cases. That’s the true nirvana, in my opinion. There will always be complexity and a need to understand the tool you’re using. But, YAML gives us an example that there can and should be better things.</p><hr><h4>See also</h4><ul><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/2019-learnings-2020-expectations/">2019 Learnings, 2020 Expectations</a></li><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/">Docker, Inc is Dead</a></li><li><a href="https://chrisshort.net/live-streaming-on-openshift.tv-and-some-lessons-learned/">Live streaming on openshift.tv and some lessons learned</a></li></ul></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p><em>(Disclaimer: This is an honest view about the MiSTer project. I am in no way affiliated with any of the sellers or
developers mentioned in this article and have no financial interest in this product. Nobody asked me or paid
me to write this. I am just a fan.)</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Here is a bit of context. I was born in 1993 in an upper-middle class family near Montreal. My parents are not
geeks. I was first exposed to video games through my cousin who owned a Nintendo Entertainment System. When he
bought/received the new Sega Genesis system, I received his NES as a hand-me-down. When he bought/received his
first PlayStation, I received his Genesis as a hand-me-down.</p>
<p>At least, that’s how I remember it happening. At the end of the day, I was always a step behind in technology,
and for this reason I have a very deep appreciation of retro technology and video game consoles, despite not
truly fitting this demographic.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://felixleger.com/img/mygenesisgames.jpg">
    
      <figcaption>I still enjoy my original Sega Genesis collection.</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>Side note, the first console my parents purchased new from a store was an Xbox in 2002 (from Costco!). The
reason? To the best of my memory, it’s because they wanted a DVD player. And for a few extra dollars they
could treat their kids. For a while, I enjoyed being part of the mainstream, but it was not meant to last.</p>

<p>As I begin my journey in the tech industry, I am more and more in awe of what my predecessors were able to
accomplish with limited means. <strong>Humans are as crafty today as they were hundreds of years ago</strong>. The only
difference is the accessibility to knowledge is vastly superior now than it used to be. If you asked me
to come up with a technology that could show images in a two-dimensional plane, I could hardly do better than
shadow puppetry.</p>
<p>Do you realize how incredibly creative some humans had to be to come up with photography, let alone the
cathode-ray tube (CRT) television or OLED flat panels? Add in the fact that interactive video games can be played
using such screens, and that I’m able to picture this phenomenon and share it on the Internet for you to
see… that’s enough to make my head spin. 😄</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://felixleger.com/img/gun-nac-setup.jpg">
    
      <figcaption>It boggles the mind to think how many layers of knowledge were required to get the result pictured here. And this is essentially a toy for kids!</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>We too often forget how the everyday technology that surrounds us is fascinating. People worked <em>hard</em> to
allow us to attain a certain level of comfort that is also reliable. If the definition of “magic” is “a
phenomenon you personally don’t understand”, then you have to admit… Under this definition, we are all
surrounded by magic!</p>

  </figure>



<p>If retro video games are magical to me, then the MiSTer FPGA is a dream come true. In my teens, even my wildest
dreams would not dare go beyond half of what the MiSTer can deliver. Let me explain what MiSTer is all about.</p>
<p>The MiSTer is a project created by <a href="https://github.com/sorgelig" target="_blank">
  Alexey Melnikov (aka Sorgelig)
</a>
. It uses the
power of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) from an off-the-shelf board named <a href="https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&amp;No=1046" target="_blank">
  Terasic DE-10
Nano
</a>
 to recreate vintage
consoles and computers at the electronic level. It is not the first open-source project of its kind, but it
certainly is the one that currently has the most momentum. While its exterior might make it look like any
other box, a “magical” FPGA chip inside allows it to transform into a multitude of systems at the electronic
level.</p>
<p>When I use the word “transform”, I really do mean that the FPGA chip inside the MiSTer re-organizes itself to
<em>become</em> whatever chipset intended by an FPGA developer. This means, if developers are careful enough, they
can accurately recreate the interior of classic machines on a single chip. Your television won’t know the
difference!</p>
<p>I won’t bother trying to explain it in more details than that,
because I don’t want to break the spell.  😄 At least, it comforts me to know that some people fully
understand this technology and are generous enough to open-source their work, for the benefit of humankind.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://felixleger.com/img/my-mister.png">
    
      <figcaption>My very own MiSTer from zerohimself, in its 3D-printed case.</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>The MiSTer is a completely different beast than products such as the RetroPie, which uses <em>software</em> emulation
instead of <em>hardware</em> emulation. Software emulation has been around for decades, and is also fascinating in
its own way. But hardware emulation based on FPGA is a whole new thing that became mainstream around 2015. I
like to think of it like the 3D-printing of electronic circuitry. It is a tool that empowers us, and the
technology is young enough that we don’t yet have to fear about its potential misuse. Now is the time to be
dreamy-eyed about it (I hope I didn’t jinx it just now!).</p>

<p>Yes, and then some. It is more than accurate.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://felixleger.com/img/nullobject-workbench2.jpeg">
    
      <figcaption>The workbench of <a href="https://twitter.com/nullobject">nullobject</a>, one of many FPGA developers specializing in reverse engineering arcade games</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>Since the same electronic circuits are being replicated, the electronic output is also the same. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>the timings are the same</li>
<li>the same “lack” of input lag is the same</li>
<li>the colors are the same</li>
<li>the sound waves are the same (<strong>Audiophiles, this should especially make your ears perk up.</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is cycle-accuracy. I’m not
just writing this way to dazzle you with buzzwords: it’s Physics. I have followed an Electronics class during
my studies of Physics, and I can assure you that it is a <em>precise</em> science. We can measure how these circuits
behave, we don’t have to rely on our eyes and ears to approximate the final result. An electronic circuit will
behave the same way no matter what is the shape of the box that contains it. This also means you won’t have to
fear about your precious original electronics starting to degrade: every time you load a console on an FPGA,
it’s as if it was fresh from the factory!</p>
<p>Even more impressive, using FPGA you can switch between different console revisions on the fly (e.g. bigger
sprite limits to prevent flickering, different color palettes, different sound chips on the Sega Genesis,
etc.). This gives us the unique opportunity of creating consoles that are more powerful than their original
versions! Do you realize what this means? With an FPGA chip in hand and the right code, you are a few lines of
code away from having what would normally require physical, irreversible modifications to existing consoles.
It should almost sound too good to be true.</p>
<p>This seems like a sales pitch, I know, but I am truly moved by how <em>significant</em> this is. I have been playing
these video games all my life and it is the first time that I can honestly say we have managed to capture the
essence of these older technologies. In reality, even
I would have difficulty in a blind test to know whether I’m playing on an FPGA or on the real deal.</p>
<h2 id="an-added-bonus-flexibility">An added bonus: flexibility</h2>
<p>A great quality of life improvement is that the MiSTer can connect to HDMI monitors, as well as CRT monitors.
It can do everything the original machines could, while also conveniently being compatible with modern-day
accessories. The flexibility of the video outputs is truly staggering on the MiSTer and could fully warrant
its own discussion. This is not only great for console games, but also for arcade games.</p>
<p>Do you know how expensive original arcade hardware is in 2020? With MiSTer, you can play most golden-age games
as if you owned the actual printed circuit board (PCB), with the added bonus of USB controllers and peace of mind of never having to
re-solder capacitors.</p>
<p>Long story short, emulating original systems on the MiSTer is as good, if not better, than playing on original
consoles. It is more reliable, convenient, and guarantees the authenticity of the electronic circuit that
powers your games. This is why I like to (half-jokingly) say that the MiSTer is even more accurate than what
it is replicating.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know.</p>
<p>I think it only comes down to lack of marketing. Since this is an open-source project made by enthusiasts
using off-the-shelf parts, opportunities to make money are limited. Thus, it is rare to see influencers spread
the good news. But more than that, the retro gaming community is currently swarmed under a tsunami of
marketing from <a href="https://www.analogue.co/" target="_blank">

<p>Analogue is a for-profit company that focuses on creating dedicated FPGA-clone consoles. While their products
are certainly beautiful and well-engineered, they are closed source and use shady business practices to boost
their sales, such as limited supplies. And their products are <em>expensive</em>, which

<p>The problem here is that Analogue products are so prohibitively expensive (or limited in
quantities) that people rarely get to compare the experience of playing on a MiSTer or an Analogue device. If
you invest in one camp, there are many factors that will make you not want to invest in the other. The few
people who managed to experience both sides of the fence will invariably tell you that the MiSTer developers
are (in the long run) more detail-oriented and support their work far more than Analogue themselves. In the
end, you can expect the same gameplay experience between both devices, if not slightly more accurate on MiSTer (the
cheaper system).</p>

<p>Really, it just pains me when I see article after article telling people to hurry up and buy the new
“fantastic” Analogue project. Just two days ago (Oct. 16 2020), they announced a new product, the

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">trolley problem</a> asks how to decide between the lives of people in two groups. At the moment, it comes up in our industry in discussions around self-driving cars: Suppose a car gets into a situation where it must risk injuring either its passengers or pedestrians; which ones should it prioritize saving?</p>
<p>Always choosing one group leads to suboptimal outcomes. If we always save the pedestrians, they may perform attacks on car riders by willfully stepping into traffic. If we always save the passengers, we may run over a pedestrian whose life happens to be of greater worth than that of the passengers.</p>
<p>The crux of the trolley problem is how we should make the choice of what lives to save. As with all hard problems without clear metrics for success, it’s best to solve this by having the participants decide this for themselves.</p>
<p>Every time we view a website, our friendly ad networks must decide what ads we should see. This is done by having our user profile put up on auction for prospective advertisers. During a handful of milliseconds, participants may inspect our profile and place a bid for our attention according to what they see.</p>
<p>The same technology could be trivially repurposed for deciding the trolley problem in the context of self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Assume the identity of every participant in the trolley scenario is known. Practically, we know the identity of the passengers; that of the pedestrians could be known if their phones broadcast a special short-range identification signal. An incentive for broadcasting such a signal could be that we would have to assume that a person without one were one of no means.</p>
<p>Given this information, a car about to be involved in a collision could take a few milliseconds to send the identities of the people involved to an auction service. Participants who had the foresight of purchasing accident insurance would have agents bidding on their behalf. The winner of the bid would be safe from the forthcoming accident, and their insurance would pay some sum to the car manufacturer post-hoc as a reward for conforming to the rules.</p>
<p>The greater a person’s individual wealth, the better insurance coverage and latencies they could purchase, and the more accidents they could expect to survive. This aligns nicely with the values of societies like the United States, where the worth of a person’s life is proportional to their wealth.</p>
<p>As this system lets self-driving car manufacturers off the hook for any decisions taken, and would need coordinated ethical action on the behalf of software engineers to not be implemented, we expect to see this system in action in the world in short order.</p>

<p>I teach SEO to a lot of people. Either in my role as an actual teacher for a university, within the organization I work for or as an advisor for a venture capital firm. I've found that while SEO has changed a lot over the years, much of what I teach is just my repeating a few simple things that have always worked and will always work. </p>
<p>They revolve around strategy. </p>
<p>Talking about SEO strategy is nothing new. Every agency out there will tout the amazing strategy they'll build for you and most companies will tell you they have some sort of SEO strategy but I would counter that people are mixing up tactics and strategy. </p>
<p>Let's take a step back though. What do I mean? </p>
<h2 id="seo-is-a-lot-of-work">SEO is a lot of work</h2>
<p>The way I generally frame my SEO class for university is that SEO is hard. I think anyone who has done it for any length of time would agree with that. On-page SEO, content creation, link building and all that can take huge amounts of time and effort and can be an insane amount of work, even for a whole team of people. </p>
<p>Which is why I spend the majority of the class talking about research rather than all the above. </p>
<h2 id="the-research-before-the-research">The research before the research</h2>
<p>The morning of the whole day class is focused on understanding who your customer is what they want. Not just your "customer" but who is your <strong>best</strong> customer? Are there a subset of customers that give you recurring revenue or a one time purchase? Do you have a life time value calculation you use? What do you know about these great customers? Can you email them some questions or a survey? Make sure you understand them and how they found you. </p>
<p>Then we go into competitors. Who are they? Do they have a massive SEO budget you'll be up against? Are there weaknesses you can use against them? Maybe you can re-frame or reposition your company so you don't seem like a competitor. </p>
<p>If you don't properly do your research, you'll be spending thousands of hours on something that could lead to nothing, when if you do your research you may need to do far less work and get huge returns. </p>
<p>Basically what I'm saying, is if your SEO strategy <strong>starts</strong> with keyword research, you may have failed before you even began. </p>
<p>The keyword research needs to be informed by your customers and competition. Just trying to find long tail keywords without understanding the context of why they are being typed in is asking for disaster. </p>
<h2 id="then-finally-the-keyword-research">Then finally, the keyword research</h2>
<p>After the students have done all that research work we finally get into the standard keyword research. This research is now going to be very different than if they had started with it. They wont just be typing keywords related to what they do, instead they'll be using the word choices their customers will lean towards and that competitors haven't touched. </p>
<p>Next I make sure they understand the context of the keyword being typed into Google. Where is the person? Why did they type in this keyword? What are they trying to accomplish? Are they just trying to answer some homework or are curious about something? If so, do you really want to work towards getting this person who likely wont buy anything? </p>
<p>At this point you'll have a simple list of keywords. It wont seem like much in excel but trust me, that list is far more powerful than the one made by the majority of agencies or companies. It is informed by competitive research, customer research and it understands the context of the person typing in the query. Then and only then should you get into the actual tactics. </p>
<p>These tactics include putting together a content strategy, making on-page changes to your site and ultimately having a link building strategy to support them. </p>
<h2 id="in-short">In Short</h2>
<p>SEO is far too much work to jump in headfirst without doing your due diligence. </p>

<![CDATA[Why You Should Do A Paid Discovery Phase]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s say you’re a consultant starting the conversation with a potential new client. They’ve decided to kick off a new technology project. Sweet! It’s an investment for them that carries a lot of opportunity… and risk.</p>
<p>Success could increase your client’s revenue, reduce their costs, and save them time. An unsuccessful project could have immeasurable costs, particularly for companies that rely on tech as a big part of their business model.</p>
<p>It’s your responsibility to do everything possible to make sure that your projects are successful. While every project and business is different, I’ve learned a few key things the hard way. One of the things that proves its worth every time is focusing on business goals - <strong>before starting to build</strong>. This sounds cliché but here’s what I mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask your clients about their BUSINESS problems and offer a BUSINESS solution. Before talking about development or technology or process. What is it that is costing them money or not making them money?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds simple. It should be. For some reason, it’s really common to skip this and go straight to solutioning. Maybe if we give it a name, it’ll be taken seriously. Let’s call it <em>Discovery</em>...</p>
<h3 id="what-is-discovery"><a href="#what-is-discovery" aria-label="what is discovery permalink"></a>What is Discovery?</h3>
<p>Discovery means exploring and pulling the unknown out into the light. A Discovery phase is a paid consulting engagement which comes before the part where you build the solution. The reason a company might do it is to reduce or eliminate risk during the build, saving both time and money by avoiding costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Discovery can look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>a series of conversations between you and people across the client team</li>
<li>diving in and checking out your clients’ current operational &amp; technical systems</li>
<li>researching different options that might be a good fit for your client</li>
</ul>
<p>Discovery can result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>written documentation of your findings (discoveries)</li>
<li>recommendations for the best method or approach to your solutions, including platform selection, systems architecture, apps, extensions, custom features, &amp; integrations</li>
<li>technical solution requirements, roadmaps, planning resources to tee up the build phase</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some things you should try to nail down during Discovery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Goals, Opportunities, and Objectives</li>
<li>Project Risks</li>
<li>Who’s Involved (Stakeholders)</li>
<li>Expectations</li>
<li>Dependencies</li>
<li>Technical Unknowns</li>
<li>Functional “Must Haves”</li>
<li>Solution Definition</li>
<li>Project Delivery Timelines</li>
<li>Costing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-project-doesnt-need-a-discovery"><a href="#my-project-doesnt-need-a-discovery" aria-label="my project doesnt need a discovery permalink"></a>My Project Doesn’t Need A Discovery</h3>
<p>For projects with tight budgets and timelines, a Discovery might seem like an unaffordable luxury. I get it. Experience has taught me that even smaller projects can save time and money by thinking strategically upfront.</p>
<p>With the information collected, you can be confident in what’s being developed and the cost. Discovery doesn’t have to take a long time. Everyone wants to cut as much overhead as possible.</p>
<p>It’s easy to jump straight into building when you start on a project. It feels productive. Everyone loves shortcuts to save time. I’ve made that mistake before. The reality is that most times it will end up taking longer and being more costly this way.</p>
<p>What’s usually missing a realistic and informed plan. In this world of agile everything, planning gets a bad name. Being aware of the unknowns isn’t wasteful though. It lets you see speed bumps coming and avoid them.</p>
<p>Often business owners will come to you self-diagnosed and self-prescribed, seeking specific solutions. In these instances, <strong>it is your obligation as a professional to validate these assumptions</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-this-going-to-help"><a href="#how-is-this-going-to-help" aria-label="how is this going to help permalink"></a>How Is This Going To Help?</h3>
<p>The truth is, technology is always changing. Often there are many different ways to use technology in solving a problem. Sometimes technology isn’t needed at all. Sometimes a change in process will get you a better result. For these reasons, your ability to understand, diagnose, and solve your clients’ business problems will always be more important than your application of a specific technology. Your clients don’t pay for the creation and application of technology - <em>they pay to solve business problems</em>.</p>
<p>The Discovery process protects the much larger investment your clients are making in building a technology solution. Better planning leads to less expensive projects.</p>
<p>Other consultants might offer “cheaper” projects without a formal discovery process. When you come up against this, ask your clients: “If we’re not doing a discovery process, can we trust the accuracy of the quote? Are we confident that this group really understands your needs? Can we trust that the proposed solutions address your goals? If not, do we believe a project without discovery will truly be cheaper long-term?”</p>
<h3 id="how-to-communicate-this"><a href="#how-to-communicate-this" aria-label="how to communicate this permalink"></a>How To Communicate This</h3>
<p>As an added bonus, here’s an actual template for an email I’ve used to get a new client onboard with the Discovery process. Feel free to use it!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Hi NAME, thanks for the information. I can get started quickly, though I would love to learn more about your needs and goals so that I’m better positioned to help you. </p><p>I use a standard process in helping to develop solutions for this type of challenge, starting with a fast Discovery. Experience has taught me that even smaller projects can save time and money by creating a realistic and informed plan of attack. With the information collected, we can both be confident in what is being developed, the timeline, and the cost. It removes risk and improves the outcome for us both. </p><p>Let me know your availability to start exploring solutions. I’m looking forward to getting started.</p></div>
</blockquote></div><p>I write about tips for consulting, technology, &amp; saving the planet. Keep up with new posts. Unsubscribe whenever. I promise I won't spam you.</p></div>]]>

<h5>About the authors: <br>Mike Del Balso, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of <a href="http://tecton.ai/">Tecton</a><br>Willem Pienaar, Creator of <a href="http://feast.dev/">Feast</a></h5>



<hr>











<p>Data teams are starting to realize that operational machine learning requires solving data problems that extend far beyond the creation of data pipelines.</p>



<p>In Tecton’s previous post, <a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/devops-ml-data/">Why We Need DevOps for ML Data</a>, we highlighted some of the key data challenges that teams face when productionizing ML systems.</p>



<ul><li>Accessing the right raw data</li><li>Building features from raw data</li><li>Combining features into training data</li><li>Calculating and serving features in production</li><li>Monitoring features in production</li></ul>



<p>Production data systems, whether for large scale analytics or real-time streaming, aren’t new. However, <em>operational machine learning</em> — ML-driven intelligence built into customer-facing applications — is new for most teams. The challenge of deploying machine learning to production for operational purposes (e.g. recommender systems, fraud detection, personalization, etc.) introduces new requirements for our data tools.</p>



<p>A new kind of ML-specific data infrastructure is emerging to make that possible.</p>



<p>Increasingly Data Science and Data Engineering teams are turning towards feature stores to manage the data sets and data pipelines needed to productionize their ML applications. This post describes the key components of a modern feature store and how the sum of these parts act as a force multiplier on organizations, by reducing duplication of data engineering efforts, speeding up the machine learning lifecycle, and unlocking a new kind of collaboration across data science teams.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Quick refresher: in ML, a <strong>feature</strong> is data used as an input signal to a predictive model.</td></tr><tr><td>For example, if a credit card company is trying to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent, a useful feature might be <em>whether the transaction is happening in a foreign country</em>, or <em>how the size of this transaction compares to the customer’s typical transaction</em>. When we refer to a feature, we’re usually referring to the concept of that signal (e.g. “transaction_in_foreign_country”), not a specific value of the feature (e.g. not “transaction #1364 was in a foreign country”).</td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore1.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>











<p><strong><em>“The interface between models and data”</em></strong></p>



<p>We first introduced feature stores in our blog post describing Uber’s <a href="https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/">Michelangelo</a> platform. Feature stores have since emerged as a necessary component of the operational machine learning stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feature stores make it easy to:</p>



<ol><li>Productionize new features without extensive engineering support</li><li>Automate feature computation, backfills, and logging</li><li>Share and reuse feature pipelines across teams</li><li>Track feature versions, lineage, and metadata</li><li>Achieve consistency between training and serving data</li><li>Monitor the health of feature pipelines in production</li></ol>



<p>Feature stores aim to solve the full set of data management problems encountered when building and operating operational ML applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A feature store is an ML-specific data system that:</p>



<ul><li>Runs data pipelines that <strong>transform</strong> raw data into feature values</li><li><strong>Stores</strong> and manages the feature data itself, and</li><li><strong>Serves</strong> feature data consistently for training and inference purposes</li></ul>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore10.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>To support simple feature management, feature stores provide data abstractions that make it easy to build, deploy, and reason about feature pipelines across environments. For example, they make it easy to define a feature transformation once, then calculate and serve its values consistently across both the development environment (for training on historical values) and the production environment (for inference with fresh feature values).</p>



<p>Feature stores act as a central hub for feature data and metadata across an ML project’s lifecycle. Data in a feature store is used for:</p>



<ul><li>feature exploration and engineering</li><li>model iteration, training, and debugging</li><li>feature discovery and sharing</li><li>production serving to a model for inference</li><li>operational health monitoring</li></ul>



<p>Feature stores bring economies of scale to ML organizations by enabling collaboration. When a feature is registered in a feature store, it becomes available for immediate reuse by other models across the organization. This reduces duplication of data engineering efforts and allows new ML projects to bootstrap with a library of curated production-ready features.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore9.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Effective feature stores are designed to be modular systems that can be adapted to the environment in which they’re deployed. There are five primary components that typically make up a feature store. In the rest of this post, we will walk through those components and describe their role in powering operational ML applications.</p>







<p>There are 5 main components of a modern feature store: Transformation, Storage, Serving, Monitoring, and feature Registry.</p>

<p>In the following sections we’ll give an overview of the purpose and typical capabilities of each of these sections.</p>



<h2>Serving</h2>



<p>Feature stores serve feature data to models. Those models require a <strong>consistent view of features across training and serving</strong>. The definitions of features used to train a model must exactly match the features provided in online serving. When they don’t match, <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml#:~:text=Training%2Dserving%20skew%20is%20a,train%20and%20when%20you%20serve.">training-serving skew</a> is introduced which can cause catastrophic and hard-to-debug model performance problems.</p>



<p><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore5.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></p>







<p>Feature stores abstract away the logic and processing used to generate a feature, providing users an easy and canonical way to access all features in a company consistently across all environments in which they’re needed.</p>



<p>When retrieving data offline (i.e. for training), feature values are commonly accessed through notebook-friendly feature store SDKs. They provide point-in-time correct views of the state of the world for each example used to train a model (a.k.a. “<a href="https://www.tecton.ai/blog/time-travel-in-ml/"><strong>time-travel</strong></a>”).</p>



<p>For online serving, a feature store delivers a single vector of features at a time made up of the freshest feature values. Responses are served through a high-performance API backed by a low-latency database.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore11.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<h2>Storage</h2>



<p>Feature stores persist feature data to support retrieval through feature serving layers. They typically contain both an online and offline storage layer to support the requirements of different feature serving systems.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore8.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Offline storage layers are typically used to store months’ or years’ worth of feature data for training purposes. Offline feature store data is often stored in data warehouses or data lakes like S3, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift. Extending an existing data lake or data warehouse for offline feature storage is typically preferred to prevent data silos.</p>



<p>Online storage layers are used to persist feature values for low-latency lookup during inference. They typically only store the latest feature values for each entity, essentially modeling the current state of the world. Online stores are usually eventually consistent, and do not have strict consistency requirements for most ML use cases. They are usually implemented with key-value stores like DynamoDB, Redis, or Cassandra.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore6.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Feature stores use an entity-based data model where each feature value is associated with an entity (e.g. a user) and a timestamp. An entity-based data model provides minimal structure to support standardized feature management, fits naturally with common feature engineering workflows, and allows for simple retrieval queries in production.</p>



<h2>Transformation</h2>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisfeaturestore2.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Operational ML applications require regular processing of new data into feature values so models can make predictions using an up-to-date view of the world. Feature stores both manage and orchestrate data transformations that produce these values, as well as ingest values produced by external systems. Transformations managed by feature stores are configured by definitions in a common feature registry (described below).</p>



<figure><p>Most teams getting started with feature stores already have existing data pipelines producing feature values. This makes it very important for feature stores to be gradually adoptable and have first class integrations with existing data platforms, allowing teams to immediately operationalize existing ETL pipelines for their ML use cases.</p></figure>



<p>Feature stores commonly interact with three main types of data transformations:</p>







<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="left">Feature Type</td><td>Definition</td><td>Common input data source</td><td data-align="left">Example</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Batch Transform</td><td>Transformations that are applied only to data at rest</td><td>Data warehouse, data lake, database</td><td data-align="left">User country, product category</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">Streaming Transform</td><td>Transformations that are applied to streaming sources</td><td>Kafka, Kinesis, PubSub</td><td data-align="left"># of clicks per vertical per user in last 30 minutes, # of views per listing in past hour</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left">On-demand transform</td><td>Transformations that are used to produce features&nbsp; based on data that is only available at the time of the prediction. These features cannot be pre-computed.</td><td>User-facing application</td><td data-align="left">Is the user currently in a supported location?<br>Similarity score between listing and search query</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A key benefit is to make it easy to use different types of features together in the same models.</p>



<figure><img src="https://2b838p24nks2163of0383y6z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/whatisafeaturestore12.svg" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Models need access to fresh feature values for inference. Feature stores accomplish this by regularly recomputing features on an ongoing basis. Transformation jobs are orchestrated to ensure new data is processed and turned into fresh new feature values. These jobs are executed on data processing engines (e.g. Spark or Pandas) to which the feature store is connected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Model development introduces different transformation requirements. When iterating on a model, new features are often engineered to be used in training datasets that correspond to historical events (e.g. all purchases in the past 6 months). To support these use cases, feature stores make it easy to run “backfill jobs” that generate and persist historical values of a feature for training. Some feature stores automatically backfill newly registered features for preconfigured time ranges for registered training datasets.</p>



<p>Transformation code is reused across environments preventing …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today on Makerlog Stories, we interview maker, writer &amp; entrepreneur Arvid Kahl. He's grown a successful SaaS, Feedback Panda, to astronomical MRR levels â€“ to then sell the startup &amp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Sold-Start-Bootstrapped-Business-ebook/dp/B08BWZS8VN">write a hit book</a> to share his breadth of knowledge.</p><h2 id="hi-arvid-tell-us-a-bit-about-yourself-">Hi Arvid! Tell us a bit about yourself.</h2><p>Iâ€™m Arvid, a developer, entrepreneur, and writer. Iâ€™ve been coding for most of my life, and Iâ€™ve always been interested in building businesses. Over the last two decades, I worked as a software engineer for small businesses, VC-funded Silicon Valley startups, and founded a number of bootstrapped businesses with friends and colleagues. Most recently, I sold the EdTech SaaS FeedbackPanda for a life-changing amount of money after growing it to $55.000 MRR with my partner Danielle Simpson from 2017 to 2019. The learnings from that journey have been the foundation for my book Zero to Sold.</p><h2 id="what-are-you-building-arvid">What are you building, Arvid?</h2><figure><img src="https://blog.getmakerlog.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png"></figure><p>Ever since selling the business, I have been writing. I didnâ€™t have any time to meaningfully reflect on my experiences while I was running FeedbackPanda. The moment we sold the company, I suddenly had all the time I needed to think about my experiences and translate them into stories and guidance for other founders. </p><p>Iâ€™m blogging every week, I release a new podcast episode every Friday, and I am currently working on my <a href="https://audiencefirst.link/">next book, â€œAudience Firstâ€�</a>.</p><h2 id="as-of-right-now-what-are-your-stats">As of right now, what are your stats?</h2><p>Zero to Sold has sold almost 2500 copies in its first quarter on the market. </p><p>I donâ€™t track much more beyond that, as having sold a business recently makes this less important. What I do track is how engaged people are with my work, and I can report that with almost 9000 followers on Twitter, this is looking pretty good.</p><h2 id="what-was-the-inspiration-behind-zero-to-sold"><br>What was the inspiration behind Zero to Sold?</h2><p>When we sold the business and transitioned it over to the new owners, we quickly realized that all of a sudden, we had come to an abrupt halt after working 24/7 for years. Within a week, we went from full-time entrepreneurs to founders without a purpose. </p><blockquote>Within a week, we went from full-time entrepreneurs to founders without a purpose. </blockquote><p>Very quickly, I decided that I needed to turn our experience into something useful for the community that had taught and lifted me up over many years. Initially, I didnâ€™t think of writing a book, but just writing articles. At some point, however, it was very clear that all those topics I wrote about were connected, and a book would pull them all together.</p><h2 id="what-was-it-like-to-sell-feedbackpanda">What was it like to sell FeedbackPanda?</h2><p>Selling a business is incredibly exciting, and it is very scary. Most people donâ€™t regularly sell their livelihood, and the amounts of money involved are staggering. It was a wonderful experience, mostly because our acquirer SureSwift Capital were such a joy to work with. The sale, the transition, and onboarding our replacements were delightful activities. Iâ€™d definitely do it again.</p><h2 id="how-was-the-process-of-writing-zero-to-sold">How was the process of writing Zero to Sold?</h2><p>Many chapters were already written when I decided that I would write a book, as I had posted to my blog for many months at that point. The rest of them were written in an intense flurry of writing that happened over the course of two weeks.</p><p><strong>I already had a lot of validation from my blog audience, and I knew which topics they would want me to write about because I asked them.</strong> I asked on Twitter, I asked in the Newsletter, I asked on my podcast. I was confident that the things I had yet to write were interesting because people demanded content, and I knew that the things I had already written were well-received because the blog visitor numbers painted that picture.</p><h2 id="how-did-you-spread-the-word-of-the-book">How did you spread the word of the book? </h2><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A few people have been asking me why I sell a 500-page book for $9.99 when it could sell for 4x that.</p><p>I want Zero to Sold to be affordable AND contain everything I know about building businesses. I want as many people as possible to read the book. That's it. Money is secondary.</p></div>— Arvid Kahl (@arvidkahl) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1286377587757981696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p><strong>I utilized Twitter substantially for the promotion of Zero to Sold.</strong> On the very first day, I published a long Twitter thread with all sorts of links, insights into why I wrote the book, who it was for, and where to find it. I engaged with everyone who liked the post, thanked everyone who retweeted it, and took a lot of time to be present for my Twitter followers. Very quickly, sales took off, and I leveraged that too. I shared screenshots of climbing numbers, which themselves encouraged people to check out the book. </p><p>The next day, I launched on Product Hunt, and had Zero to Sold in the #1 spot for 18 hours. For the next few weeks, I shared a lot of sales figures, and I engaged with everyone who talked about the book on Twitter. I still do that today, and that is, in essence, the only marketing I do. I talk about the book, and I point at people who talk about it.</p><h2 id="did-it-ever-cross-your-mind-that-zero-to-sold-would-be-such-a-hit">Did it ever cross your mind that Zero to Sold would be such a hit?</h2><blockquote>I think Zero to Sold is what it should be: itâ€™s the book I would have loved to read 5 years ago, before I had any real idea about how to start, run, or sell a bootstrapped business.</blockquote><p>When I launched the book, I hoped to sell twenty books on day one, maybe 50. Within the first 24 hours, I sold 350 books, and 1000 within the first week. I never thought the book would be that successful, no.</p><p> But I do recognize that Zero to Sold was an opportunity for many of my followers to finally give something back. I had written valuable content for months, for free. Now here was a chance to say thank you. Many people took that opportunity and showed me their support.</p><h2 id="publishing-is-an-interesting-business-how-were-your-interactions-with-it-the-editing-process-getting-the-book-out-there-etc-">Publishing is an interesting business: how were your interactions with it? (the editing process, getting the book out there, etc.)</h2><p>Once I had finished my first draft, I immediately hired a copy editor from Reedsy and had them work on the book. I knew that I couldnâ€™t â€œjust ship itâ€� â€” after all, this is not a piece of software that can be easily deployed and updated. Once a book is in a bookshelf, it wonâ€™t change. So I had to make sure the quality of the book was high enough from the start. After the copy editing, I had a professional proofreader go through it again. </p><p>All in all, somewhere around 5000 things needed to be changed. I worked in those changes, made sure they still fit my vision, and then I was finally done. I used <a href="https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/how-i-self-published-zero-to-sold-a-bestselling-book-on-bootstrapping/">a number of tools</a> to create the print and digital versions from the same source manuscript, which I then uploaded to Amazon KDP and Gumroad, making the book available within a few days as a print-on-demand paperback, as a PDF, and for eReaders.</p><h2 id="would-you-change-anything-in-your-book-if-so-what-would-it-be">Would you change anything in your book? If so, what would it be?</h2><p>I would probably add even more anecdotes, because many people learn best from stories of other peopleâ€™s successes and failures. But the book is already 500 pages, any more and it would become a safety hazard. </p><p>I think Zero to Sold is what it should be: itâ€™s the book I would have loved to read 5 years ago, before I had any real idea about how to start, run, or sell a bootstrapped business.</p><h2 id="what-were-some-of-the-biggest-challenges-that-you-ve-faced-as-an-entrepreneur">What were some of the biggest challenges that you've faced as an entrepreneur?</h2><p><br>Personally, I found that I had the most trouble delegating. This resulted in us never hiring another customer service representative or engineer, both positions that could have helped me while we ran the business. </p><p>As a consequence, I developed severe stress and anxieties, stuff that I am still working on today. <strong>If you value your mental health, consider that finding other people that can help you is a net gain, not a loss.</strong> I write about this kind of self-delusion extensively in Zero to Sold, because I want founders to understand that they can easily fall prey to their own minds, and that theyâ€™re better off understanding the demons they might be facing on their own journey.</p><hr><h2 id="we-found-out-that-you-studied-political-science-and-computer-science-how-has-that-combination-shaped-your-way-of-thinking">We found out that you studied political science and computer science; how has that combination shaped your way of thinking?</h2><p>Computer science and political science both depend on a clear understanding of logic. No matter if youâ€™re looking through a codebase of a political institution, you will find infrastructure, decisions, policies, and consequences. Studying two fields that look at seemingly different topics with a similar underlying foundation has allowed me to work with multiple perspectives in mind at all times. Also, studying a social science teaches you quite quickly that â€œtruthâ€� is a construct, and that everything should be deeply and intentionally inspected before you act on it â€” just like this piece of advice ;)</p><h2 id="how-do-you-balance-the-hustle-and-wellness"><br>How do you balance the hustle and wellness?</h2><p><br>Digital detox vacations and no-screen time blocking have helped me. Taking long walks, best daily, also allows me to unwind and keep my mind â€œaired out.â€� I am always thinking about something work-related, so reading fiction can help pulling myself out of the constant state of working.</p><p>I am a great fan of the Pet Shop Boys. For some reason, their style of pop and dance music just makes me very happy. I often listen to their <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/56Z44BHAMa9GUhHYRyyetP?si=Cz6tFZvdS0Ky1sswaiz_Ww">extensive discography</a> when I need to think.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="closing-question-what-advice-would-you-give-to-other-makers-out-there"><br>Closing question: What advice would you give to other makers out there?</h2><p>Read books. Listen to podcasts. Ask questions. Learn in public. Examine any piece of advice you get, understand where itâ€™s coming from and if it makes sense for you. Donâ€™t fall for promises of quick riches, building a sustainable business takes time. Forge relationships with your audience, understand that theyâ€™re not just your customers, they are the reason for your business to exist.</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Recently I found my old Eee PC 901 at the bottom of a drawer sitting and
collecting dust. It served me well a decade ago and I still have fond memories
of it, but by modern standard it's really obsolete as a laptop. With Intel Atom
N270 and 2GB DDR2 RAM at its heart, I'm not sure it'll win over even Raspberry
Pi 4. Yet it is in a good working condition, and I couldn't bring myself to
discard it into the trash bin.</p>
<p>At a peak of its popularity Eee PC family was very popular in the
hacking/modding community, so I went on to see if there's something cool I can
do with it. I've never really messed with hardware before, so even if it doesn't
work out, I'll learn something useful from it.</p>
<p>In this post I'll document interfaces that exist on Eee PC 901 motherboard and
present interest for modding. Kudos to the Eee PC community who reverse
engineered all of this, I'll try to cite original sources to the best of my
ability, but internet archeology is hard, so apologies if I misidentify any.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the most useful sources were the ASUS original
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ASUS+P901+Rev1.3G+Schematic+Diagram.pdf">motherboard schematics</a>
and
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=asus_p901_rev_1.3g_boardview.zip">component layout</a>,
which you can find with a little bit of googling. I also relied heavily on
postinga at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121129075421/http://forum.eeeuser.com/index.php?showforum=26">eeeuser.com</a>
(down and gone, but mostly available through web archive),
<a href="http://eee-pc.ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3:%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F">eee-pc.ru</a>
(which is also frequently down) and <a href="http://jkkmobile.com/">jkkmobile.com</a>. Some
specifics about supported protocol versions were found in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201023163054/https://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/Intel_mobileatomn270singlecoredatasheet.pdf">Intel Atom N270 datasheet</a>
and

(south bridge). I also found helpful notes at ivc.no
<a href="https://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/Eee_PC_Internal_Upgrades">1</a>,
<a href="https://beta.ivc.no/wiki/index.php/Eee_PC_Research">2</a>, although they focus on
Eee PC <strong>7</strong>01.</p>
<p>Use this information at your own risk! I did my best to cross-check the information between sources, but I haven't tried any of this myself yet!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: ASUS crammed all possible mass storage buses into a single proprietary
interface. It is incompatible with either mini PCI-E spec or mSATA, despite
sharing the mechanical socket.</strong></p>
<p>In Eee PC 901 they are used to connect the 5mm, 4 GB internal SSD (IDE1) and the
more easily accessible 7mm, 16 GB secondary SSD (IDE2). The same interface was
used for internal storage in most other models.</p>
<p>These two are the most notorious in the hacking community for the amount of
confusion and wasted money they are responsible for 😅 Mechanically they are
identical to mini PCI-E and mSATA interfaces, but aren't really compatible with
either. They are loosely inspired by mini PCI-E, but ASUS engineers liberally
rewired them to their own needs.</p>
<p>The complete pinout was

<li>Yellow, orange and light violet pads are parts of IDE/PATA bus, which is
shared between all IDE1-3 connectors (more on it later). <em>tie2</em> (eeeuser.com)
published instructions
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421072808/http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?pid=183442#p183442">connecting CompactFlash to it</a>
(<a href="https://beta.ivc.no/eee/EeePC_Hack_withinCF_E_.pdf">pdf</a>) using the IDE bus.</li>
<li>The blue <code>USB_D±</code> pads are indeed the USB bus, which is about the only thing
compatible with mini PCI-E standard, apart from <code>GND</code>. Sadly only IDE2
connector has them functional on the 901 model.</li>
<li>Most notable are the light-blue pads, which carry a proper SATA data bus
signals. Unlike the IDE bus IDE1 and 2 have independent SATA buses, which
appear to be usable at the same time and independently from IDE. Eee-pc.ru
wiki has a nice instruction on
<a href="http://eee-pc.ru/wiki/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3:sata">connecting 2.5” SATA disks</a>
to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>So <code>FLASH_CON</code> is more like “the ultimate mass storage interface” than mini
PCI-E. Unfortunately, they are most often referred to as ASUS mini PCI-E,
causing incredible confusion for people looking to upgrade EEE PC's slow SSDs,
but this is easily a whole separate post…</p>
<h3 id="ide3">IDE3</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: A standard, slow and boring ZIF-40 PATA port on the same bus as IDE1
and 2.</strong></p>
<p>This is <code>FLASH_CON</code>'s little brother which only includes IDE/PATA bus organized
as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_insertion_force#Hard_disk_drives">ZIF-40 connector</a>.
The connector was soldered-on in 901's earlier batches, but in later revisions
was left as bare soldering pads. This connector format was popular with compact
1.8” drives prior to SATA, and there are still some offerings available. Pin
arrangement is basically the same as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_ATA">40-pin PATA ribbon cable</a>.</p>
<p>jkkmobile published a guide for connecting an
<a href="http://www.jkkmobile.com/2008/07/how-to-add-more-storage-to-asus-eee-pc.html">hdd or CompactFlash</a>
to this slot, although these days it's far more practical to use SATA-based
solutions.</p>
<p>Because IDE1, IDE2 and IDE3 ports all use the same physical bus, only two can
actually have a device connected at the same time via <em>PATA</em> protocol. However,
as far as I can tell it should be possible to have two SATA devices connected to
IDE 1 and 2, and a PATA drive to IDE 3. Practicality of this approach is
questionable, however, side 1.8” PATA ZIF drives are slow and hard to come by.
Using <code>FLASH_CON</code> to mSATA adapters is a much easier way to get a fast and
high-capacity storage without any soldering.</p>
<h3 id="3gcard">3GCARD</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: A regular mini PCI-E slot, requires soldering to make use of it in most
901s.</strong></p>
<p>This slot is not soldered-on in all Eee PC 901 versions except the “901 GO”
variant with a 3G modem onboard.</p>
<p>Unlike <code>FLASH_CON</code>, this is an actual mini PCI-E interface, compatible
mechanically and electrically. Unfortunately, in non-GO versions not only you
have to solder the socket on, but also
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110323015910/http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?pid=684627#p684627">bridge a few connections</a>
on the motherboard to get USB and PCI-E lines functional (credit to the
eeeuser.com member <em>hoarkus</em>, who also managed to connect
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcom_Crystal_HD">Broadcom Crystal HD</a> video
decoder to this slot). Internet has little information about the state of this
port in the “GO” version, but I expect it is more functional out of box.</p>
<p><em>jkkmobile</em> posted instructions for
<a href="http://www.jkkmobile.com/2008/09/how-to-internal-3g-hsdpa-on-asus-eee-pc.html">installing 3g modem into a non-GO 901</a>.
Notably, the lines leading to the SIM slot seem to be intact in all revisions,
which is very nice. Surprisingly, this is sort of compatible with the mini PCI-E
spec, which reserves pins 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 for connection with a SIM module,
although without specifying exact purposes of each pin.</p>
<p>Curiously, the schematics marks pins 39, 41 and 43 as related to GPS which, to
my knowledge, never shipped on 901 models. It appears ASUS engineers wanted to
have a 5v source available to the just in case, so <strong>(warning, untested!)</strong>
shorting this contact puts 5v onto pin 39:</p>

  
    
      <figure>
        <img src="https://nevkontakte.com/2020/eee-pc-connectors/3gcard_v5.jpg" alt="3gcard_v5.jpg">
        <figcaption>Short these contacts to get +5v on 3GCARD pin 39. The place is top-left of the SD card reader in the topside of the motherboard.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    
  

<p>This could be handy if you are designing your own PCB to go into the slot or
want to connect a regular USB device trough this slot.</p>
<h3 id="minicard">MINICARD</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: A functional mini PCI-E connector, but without the USB lines.</strong></p>
<p>I almost wrote this this is, for once, a standard-compliant mini PCI-E port, but
alas, the <code>USB_D±</code> pins are not connected, even though they should be by the
spec. But the rest of the interface is functional, including the PCI-E 1x line,
which is nice.</p>
<p>This slot is normally occupied by the WiFi adapter, which is kinda essential and
therefore didn't gain too much attention from the modder community. However,
there are loads of interesting things one could try and plug into a spare mini
PCI-E slot: high-performance network adapter, SATA controller or even external
GPU 🤪 Might be worth the hassle of replacing the stock WiFi adapter with a USB
one.</p>
<h3 id="usb-ports">USB ports</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR: there are at least 4 internal USB lines one could use, but all require
some soldering.</strong></p>
<p>USB ports are bread and butter for connecting extra bells and whistles to Eee
PCs. Obviously, there are 3 external ports, which aren't very convenient for
internal mods. In addition there are a few more internal that could be
repurposed for various needs.</p>
<p>I already mentioned above that IDE2 and 3GCARD have USB data lines on pins 36
and 38, which aren't used by anything (at least in non-GO versions) and can be
repurposed without a sacrifice. You'll have to route 5v and GND from someplace
else, though.</p>
<p>Next there's BlueTooth adapter, which is probably the next-best trade for
something cool. It uses a 10-pin connector, most of which are used for
uninteresting stuff like toggling the radio on an off. For modding purposes the
more interesting pins are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 — <code>GND</code>.</li>
<li>2 — <code>USB_D+</code>.</li>
<li>3 — <code>USB_D-</code>.</li>
<li>8 — <code>+3v</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next option is webcam's connector, which has all the standard USB leads:
<code>GND</code>, <code>USB_D+</code>, <code>USB_D-</code> and <code>+5v</code>. They seem the be using
<code>SM04B-SRSS-TB(LFSN)</code> PCB header for it, so potentially you could connect
through it without soldering on the motherboard. Also this is the only internal
USB port with 5v on it.</p>
<p>Technically, there's also the SD card reader, which also has USB data lines, but
they are routed in a really inaccessible way, so it's better to leave it alone
😑</p>
<p>As a side note, it is possible to cram a USB hub board into Eee PC to get even
more ports, and I read reports of people doing it with 701 models.</p>
<h3 id="internal-audio">Internal audio</h3>
<p>I wasn't able to find reliable information, but <code>MIC</code> (internal microphone)
connector seems to be a digital protocol, probably
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-density_modulation">PDM</a>. If you feel
adventurous, motherboard schematics is your friend.</p>
<p>Internal <code>SPEAKERS</code>, in opposite, are a straightforward analog stereo signal.</p>
<h3 id="spi">SPI</h3>
<p>SPI is a well-known interface that is used for things like recovering from
really bad BIOS update mishaps. The only relevant material for EEE PC 901 I
found was a detailed posting by eeeuser.com member <em>naviathan</em>, who managed to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100625213932/http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=79049">re-flash BOIS using another linux machine</a>.
I really hope I won't need it 😅</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<!-- .entry-header -->

		<div>
			
<p>So, I’ve been <a href="https://twitter.com/_jan_schulte_/status/1315482456649355265?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking with many software agency owners</a> lately. A common theme in these conversations was always <em>“How do I acquire new clients?”</em>, “Why are prospects not listening to me? When we talk about software development, software developers can relate. They want to work with us, but decision-makers don’t care.”</p>



<p>Can you relate to this? Have you seen this too?</p>



<p>I think it’s essential for you to as well to develop these new customers, right? But what should you do when decision-makers, the C-Level Suite, is not listening to you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why wouldn’t they want software development to be an essential topic in their organization?</p>



<p>Let’s examine this. Other Software Developers listen to you because you speak their language. You can relate to their challenges, how hard it is for them to deliver, how messy deployments are, and that it’s about time to establish more best practices across the team.</p>



<p>But still, why do C-Level folks not care about this? They benefit from that too! Correct. Indirectly, they benefit from more best practices, such as pair programming or code reviews. Indirectly? Software Developers have specific goals. To deliver the new release, fix bugs, and set up reliable workflows. All these goals pay into the overall mission of providing value for their end-users and ensuring its success.</p>



<p>On the other hand, C-Level folks have the same overarching mission, running a successful company, but their concrete goals are different. Whereas a Software developer may measure success based on metrics such as feature work completed in a sprint, or new bug reports per month, the CTO’s and CEO’s look at a different dashboard.</p>



<p>For them, metrics such as ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), decreased costs, and increased team efficiency without hiring new people are essential. That’s how their success is measured.</p>



<p>Now, my question for you is: How do your offerings relate to these metrics? If a CTO wants to decrease costs, how much money can you save them over a quarter, half a year, or a full year? How can you help a CTO to be more successful?</p>



<p>You need to take your current product or offering and tailor benefits for different personas to answer these questions:</p>



<ul><li>How does a developer benefit from your work?&nbsp;</li><li>How does your offering relate to business metrics?</li><li>How can you help CTO’s to influence their business metrics positively?</li></ul>



<p>Then, next time you conduct a discovery call or meeting with a prospect, ask for everybody’s position at the company so you can tailor your arguments and benefits toward their roles and concerns.</p>



<p>So you will demonstrate to your prospect that you understand them and their business as a whole.</p>



<p>Was this helpful? I’d love to hear from you how this strategy helped you in your business. If you need further support with crafting the right messages, get in touch via <a href="https://work-with-jan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://work-with-jan.com</a>! I’m looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>With <a aria-label="#HacktoberFest (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#HacktoberFest</a> being a thing, there has been an influx of devs desperately trying to contribute to their favorite Open-Source projects. Unfortunately, many of these pull requests have been a waste of time, with the maintainers ultimately unable to use the contributions. Maintainers don’t want to waste their time reviewing bad PRs, and contributors don’t want to waste their time writing code that will never make it into production.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some common pitfalls that developers fall prey to when working on an open-source project. As a side note, we recently open-sourced the <a href="https://app.qvault.io/">Qvault</a> front-end, so take a look<a href="https://github.com/qvault/webapp" rel="noopener"> at that</a> if you want to help out.</p>



<h2>1. Pull Requests Should Handle ONE Thing</h2>



<p>Don’t open a PR like this:</p>



<ul><li>Fixes bug #543</li><li>Adds new linting rules</li><li>Includes feature #456</li></ul>



<p>Your PR should do <em>one thing</em>. Small diffs decrease the cognitive load of the reviewer and make it easier to get your code into the main branch. If you have beef with multiple issues in a project then open multiple PRs.</p>



<h2>2. Don’t Break Consistency</h2>



<p>This one happens the most often to me in my own projects. Well-intentioned developers open pull requests with any of the following annoyances:</p>



<ul><li>Omitting semicolons in a project that prefers them</li><li>Using spaces in a project that has clearly been using tabs</li><li>Introducing snake_case in a camelCase repo</li></ul>



<p>When you contribute to an existing project, use the existing styling. No one gives two hoots about your preference on the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI" target="_blank" aria-label="tabs vs spaces (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tabs vs spaces</a>” debate in the context of this pull request.</p>



<p>If you think styling needs to change, see points #1 and #3.</p>



<h2>3. Don’t Start Work Without Approval</h2>



<p>If you hop into a Github repo and find something you don’t like, don’t immediately open a pull request. Follow these steps instead:</p>



<ul><li>Is there already an issue logged? If not, make one.</li><li>If there is an issue, reach out to the maintainers (just comment on the issue) and let them know you want to work on it, and give a quick overview of how you will address it.</li><li>Assuming you have their blessing, start work on your PR.</li></ul>



<p>This will help mitigate the creation of pointless PRs that will never be accepted on the basis of a flawed premise.</p>



<h2>4. Don’t Re-open Known Problems/Solutions</h2>



<p>Some codebases have thousands of open issues, take the <a aria-label="Go language (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/golang/go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Go language</a> project, or the <a aria-label="nocode repository (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nocode repository</a> as an example. No one wants to read your duplicate issue or review your duplicate pull request. Make sure there isn’t an existing open <em>or closed</em> issue for what you are trying to address.</p>



<h2>5. Squash Those Commits</h2>



<p>Not every project will require (or care) about <a aria-label="commit squashing (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/How-to-squash-commits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">commit squashing</a>. That said, there are no projects that require <em>not</em> squashing commits. To be on the safe side just give ’em a squash.</p>



<h2>6. Be Meaningful</h2>



<p>Rewording documentation and other frivolous changes make you look like <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aspam" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">these assholes</a>. This particularly <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6075" target="_blank" aria-label="atrocious example (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">atrocious example</a> is not only scoped to pointless documentation changes but actually makes the documentation <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p><i>Imagine owning a Bugatti Chiron with a 261 mph top speed - a masterpiece of art, form, and technique. Absolute mint. Now imagine running it on water. Dear ML Engineer, you may have the best machine learning model but without the right data, it will fall flat on its face and may never rise again.</i></p>
<p>Data is the new oil - and just as oil needs the right refining to come into perfect usage, data too needs curing.  The power of your machine learning models will greatly depend on the quality of your data.</p>
<p>As AI integration across industries picks greater pace, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/certification/artificial-intelligence-certification">ML engineers</a> are confronted with a sad reality - once stakeholders identify a use case with proven ROI, they are eager to jump onto the AI ship, and data curation is not given its due importance.  In a survey of 150 machine learning engineers at large companies, 41 percent say their data is too siloed.</p>
<p>The assumption that AI only needs to be fed random data collected and combined on a huge scale can gravely backfire. Incorrect datasets can come in many forms ranging from factually incorrect information to knowledge gaps to incorrect guidelines. Among many other problems, an uncurated dataset can be:</p>

<li><p>Biased: A few popular AI used for image recognition recently displayed menacing gender and racial bias.</p></li>
<li><p>Inaccurate, unreliable or falsely represented</p></li>
<li><p>Error-ridden or ambiguous</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using uncurated raw datasets is “found to decrease the feature quality when evaluated on a transfer task” (Caron et al, 2019).</p>
<p> So how do we prepare datasets in a way that they serve the exact purpose ML engineers want them to? Before digging into this question, let’s see the types of datasets a ML engineer needs.</p>
<h4> Types of Datasets for Machine Learning</h4>
<p>ML engineers depend on data during each step of their AI journey – from model selection, training, and tuning to testing. These datasets usually fall under three categories: training sets, validation sets, and testing sets.</p>
<p> Every ML project begins with two data sets: the training data set and the testing data set.</p>
<p> The training data set is used to train an algorithm, apply concepts, learn, and give results. Around 60 percent of data is training data.</p>
<p>Testing data is used to test the validity of the training data set. Training data is not used for testing because it will produce the expected output. The testing data set comprises of 20 percent of the total data.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/final-estimate.jpg" title=""></p>
<p> Validation tests are used to identify and tune the ML model.</p>
<h4>Data Curation for Machine Learning</h4>
<p>Data curators collect data from multiple sources, integrate it into one form, authenticate, manage, archive, preserve, retrieve, and represent it.</p>
<p> The process of curating datasets for machine learning starts well before availing datasets. Here’s what we suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify the goal of AI</p></li>
<li><p>Identify what dataset you will need to solve the problem</p></li>
<li><p>Make a record of your assumptions while selecting the data</p></li>
<li><p>Aim for collecting diverse and meaningful data from both external and internal resources</p></li>
<li><p>Build a dataset that is hard for your competitors to copy</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a small dataset, using a model pre-trained on large datasets can be a good idea. You can use your small dataset to fine-tune it.</p>
<p>Once you have collected the right data, you can proceed with building the training set. This step of putting data in the optimal format is called feature transformation and it comprises four stages:</p>
<p> <b><u>Formatting:</u></b> The data is spread in different formats. Formatting will bring it together in one sheet. For example, customer data can come with different currencies, languages, etc. These need to be compiled under one format.</p>
<p><b><u>Labeling:</u></b> Labeling is done to ensure the data set works for your model. For example, a self-driving car will need data labeled as pictures of cars, pedestrians, street signs, footpaths etc.</p>
<p><b><u>Data Cleaning:</u></b> Unwanted characters are removed and missing values are dealt with.</p>
<p><b><u> Feature extraction:</u></b> A number of features are analyzed and optimized. Features that are important for prediction are selected for quicker computation and less memory consumption.</p>
<h4> The Upshot</h4>
<p> A dataset alone can ensure the success or failure of ML model. Data curation is one of the fundamental aspects of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/11-must-know-machine-learning-algorithms-for-ai-professionals">machine learning</a> and if used right, it can unleash great power. The process may appear time-consuming, but it will ensure your dataset’s calibration with your model’s goals at every step.</p>
<p>“Curations are about where the humans can actually add their knowledge to what the machine has automated.”- Stephanie McReynolds, VP of marketing at Alation</p>
<p><i>Setting up a data curation team and process can look expensive in the short term, therefore organizations must closely study their relevance in the future. Unsupervised methods trained on curated data are available yet, expensive. Choose wisely.</i></p>

<p>In this book we will work through the motivation and technical details behind <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">differential dataflow</a>, a computational framework build on top of <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow">timely dataflow</a> intended for efficiently performing computations on large amounts of data and <em>maintaining</em> the computations as the data change.</p>
<p>Differential dataflow programs look like many standard "big data" computations, borrowing idioms from frameworks like MapReduce and SQL. However, once you write and run your program, you can <em>change</em> the data inputs to the computation, and differential dataflow will promptly show you the corresponding changes in its output. Promptly meaning in as little as milliseconds.</p>
<p>This relatively simple set-up, write programs and then change inputs, leads to a surprising breadth of exciting and new classes of scalable computation. We will explore it in this document!</p>
<hr>
<p>Differential dataflow arose from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/naiad_sosp2013.pdf">work at Microsoft Research</a>, where we aimed to build a high-level framework that could both compute and incrementally maintain non-trivial algorithms.</p>

</ul>

<p>I’ve been looking to try my hand at IC decapsulation for years, and finally got
the time to do it. The process took plenty of trial and error, so this post will
document most of my failures and successes, and detail the methodologies used for
each attempt. These are most of the ICs I worked on throughout the process:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/macro-all-manipulated-ics.jpg" alt="Most ICs I experimented on"></p>

<p>A typical chip is built as a silicon die, connected to its leads/contacts through
bonding wires, and encapsulated in resin for protection.</p>

<p>Of course, there are other ICs that use different designs and encapsulation
materials: mostly metal and plastics. But the epoxy-based design is extremely
common, so we’ll be focusing on it.</p>

<p>This picture of a DIP package -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DIP_package_sideview.PNG">courtesy of Wikipedia</a>-
explains it very well:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/3rd-party/DIP_package_sideview.png" alt="Generic IC diagram"></p>

<p>The decapsulation/decapping of Integrated Circuits, also known as “delidding”, is
nothing new.</p>

<p>It’s used in the industry to debug hardware issues, reverse engineer chips, verify
the authenticity of parts, and other tasks that require access to the underlying
circuitry.</p>

<p>That’s why there’s plenty of commercial services that will decapsulate your ICs
using expensive and dedicated equipment.
I’ve linked a couple of them in <a href="#resources">the bibliography</a>.
But, without having any idea how much they cost or how long they take, I can’t
imagine them being an option for the average hacker.</p>

<p>Hackers and smaller companies generally decap Integrated Circuits to identify
counterfeits, gain a very rudimentary understanding of the parts comprising them,
or just to share the pretty pictures of the silicon die.
For those cases, a DIY process is generally good enough.</p>

<p>Decapping/delidding has also been used by hackers for more fun purposes, such as
<a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=40">unsetting efuses from production hardware to extract and/or override their firmware</a>,
private keys, etc.
So there are cases where a commercial-level result can be worth it.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to try my hand at decapping ICs for years, for no other purpose
than to satiate my curiosity. I’ve finally had the time to get to it, so this
post will describe the methods I tried and the hurdles I encountered.</p>



<p>The biggest factor to decide which method is best for your project is whether
or not you need the chip to still work after it’s been decapsulated. That means
not destroying or disconnecting the die, bonding wires, external contact points,
etc. so you can still use the chip after the process is complete.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of the most common options.</p>

<p>Destructive methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.experimental-engineering.co.uk/2016/02/20/ic-decapping-the-process/">Burn the encapsulation to hell</a> using a blowtorch</li>
  <li><a href="http://jg.sn.sg/decap/">Full wet chemical decapsulation</a>: Bath the entire chip in acid to remove all encapsulation, leads, bonds, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-destructive methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selective wet chemical decapsulation:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1707865">Rubber gaskets + acid yet for targetted decapping</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT1FStxAVz4">Manual acid deposition</a>:
Repeatedly apply drops of acid on the IC’s target area, and rinse the acid
residue and weakened encapsulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://bseteq.com/decapsulation/plasma-decap/plaser-plasma-decapsulation-system/">Plasma etching</a>
uses expensive equipment to create plasma, make it react with the encapsulation,
and drain it away</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post we’re gonna focus on the manual acid deposition method, to achieve
non-destructive decapsulation at a reasonable cost.</p>



<p>First of all, let me preface this safety talk with an important disclaimer:
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I’M DOING. My thing is firmware and electronics, not chemistry.</p>

<p>PLEASE, do not assume the safety measures discussed here are valid or enough to
protect yourself. Do your own research, follow any and all measures you deem
appropriate, and remain paranoid all along the process.</p>

<p>We’re dealing with very dangerous chemicals. If you decide to replicate the
experiments it’s at your own peril.</p>

<p>Here are more authoritative sources of safety information for a project like this.
Review as much of this info as you can, and take it with the seriousness it requires:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://safetyservices.ucdavis.edu/safetynet/safe-use-of-nitric-acid">UCDavis docs on the safe use of nitric acid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/safety-centers-of-expertise-us/respiratory-protection/respirator-selection/">3M respiratory protection selection guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nitric-acid/default.html">CDC resources on the use of nitric acid</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftACSEJ6DZA">NileRed’s “Chemistry is Dangerous” introduction to personal protection when working with chemicals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After doing enough research to feel comfortable with the risks involved, I settled
for following these measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run all experiments outside, with all nearby windows closed, and never accessing
the area without using PPE. I might invest in a fume hood in the future, either
commercial or DIY</li>
  <li>Wear chemical splash goggles. They should protect your eyes from droplets
coming from any direction. If they become uncomfortable or fog up, do not remove
them or pull them off your face in the working area</li>
  <li>Wear a respirator mask with filters that are appropriate for chemical fumes.
Preferably a full face mask, to avoid acid splashes</li>
  <li>Wear gloves that are appropriate for the acids you’re dealing with. Nitrile gloves
should NOT be used to work with nitric acid; especially fuming (98%+) nitric acid.
Long, thick neoprene-based gloves are best for Nitric, but make delicate tasks
difficult. I settled for wearing a thick neoprene glove on my non-dominant hand,
and a vinyl glove on my dominant hand for the more delicate work. When touching
any surface that’s hot or has been in touch with acid, I use the neoprene glove</li>
  <li>Expose as little of your skin as possible: Wear shoes, trousers (not shorts),
long sleeves… Preferably use a lab coat, so you can remove the acid-splashed
clothing without dragging it over your face</li>
  <li>Never mix chemicals without fully understanding the outcome to expect. Keep
different chemicals as far apart from each other as possible. Keep the smallest
possible amount of dangerous chemicals in the working area</li>
  <li>Be prepared for the worst:
    <ul>
      <li>Keep enough sodium bicarbonate at hand to neutralize acid spills and leftover acid.
Keep in mind that neutralizing acid with bicarb will give off heat, and the bubbling
could be dangerously vigorous for significant amounts. Expect the possibility of
a spill during the neutralization process</li>
      <li>Keep enough water at hand to dilute chemicals in case of spills, splashes, etc.</li>
      <li>Understand what are the recommended procedures in case of any given chemical
contacting your skin, eyes, etc. Eyes are generally the most sensitive to chemical
splashes, as they can be permanently damaged in seconds; they’re also the most
difficult to clean up, so be particularly careful with them and have a plan of
action in case the worst happens</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/ppe.jpg" alt="Picture of my PPE"></p>



<p>These describe failures and successes, and what I learned along the way.
Keep in mind that most resources I’ve found recommend using fuming nitric acid
(86%+).</p>

<p>I was not able to source fuming nitric acid, so I used concentrated nitric
(69%) instead. That could account for some of the problems I’m about to describe,
but worked fine once I found the most fitting methodology.</p>



<p>Chemicals I used during my experiments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Concentrated (69%) Nitric Acid</li>
  <li>100% Sodium bicarbonate - Bought on Amazon</li>
  <li>98% methanol - From a hardware store</li>
  <li>Acetone - From a hardware store</li>
  <li>Water - Either tap water or regular distilled water from a grocery store</li>
</ol>

<p>I also ran a couple of tests using Sulfuric Acid, both standalone and mixed with
the Nitric, but the results were not very promising. Probably because of the
encapsulation material used in my ICs. These are the acids I used:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/all-chemicals.jpg" alt="Both bottles of acid used during my experiments"></p>

<p>Necessary equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dremel
    <ul>
      <li>I’ve found <a href="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/dremel-diamond-pointy-bit.jpg">this off-brand pointy diamond bit</a>
to work great</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hot plate</li>
  <li>High-temperature and acid safe recipient
    <ul>
      <li>Tried using ceramic recipients and they worked well enough, but it was hard
to maintain a stable temperature outside using my hot plate</li>
      <li>Graphite ingot molds ended up being better at conducting heat (hence
maintaining a reasonably stable temperature outside) and providing easy access
to the IC inside</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Plastic tweezers</li>
  <li>A syringe, or preferably an assortment of them</li>
</ol>

<p>Other very useful equipment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An Erlenmeyer flask to keep a small amount of acid in a stable container</li>
  <li>Pipettes:
    <ul>
      <li>10ml pipette to transfer acid from its primary container to the flask</li>
      <li>1ml pipette to drop acid on the ICs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beakers:
    <ul>
      <li>A small one for acetone</li>
      <li>A large one for water, to rinse tools</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thermocouple to monitor the temperature of the hot plate and IC container</li>
  <li>Tongs to move the hot ceramic/graphite container</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic cleaner. Explained later</li>
</ol>

<p>This picture shows most of the equipment used for the most successful method:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/ultrasonic-acetone-all-equipment.jpg" alt="All the equipment used for the most successful method"></p>

<h2 id="attempt-1-sand-down-the-epoxy-packaging">Attempt 1: Sand down the epoxy packaging</h2>

<p>This is how the project started. I just got a new microscope, met with a couple
of good friends, and we started looking at some random samples. Blood, dust, etc.</p>

<p>Then we decided to take a look at some random IC. We were not looking to
see anything useful or complete; just an overall image of the silicon die in
an IC, so I sanded down a microcontroller and we took a look. The result, as
expected, was absolute garbage:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/macro-sanded-pic.jpg" alt="Macro: Sanded down IC"></p>

<p><img src="https://jcjc-dev.com/assets/ic-decapping/jc/micro-sanded-pic.jpg" alt="Micro: Sanded down silicon die"></p>

<p>Well, that went exactly as terribly as expected… Time to go down the rabbit hole.</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2-dremel--69-nitric-acid--gentle-acetone-bath">Attempt 2: Dremel + 69% Nitric Acid + Gentle acetone bath</h2>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drill a pocket on the top of the epoxy package so the acid does not spill over
to the leads.</li>
  <li>Place IC on a ceramic or graphite recipient, on top of the hot plate. Attach
a thermocouple to the recipient to monitor its temperature</li>
  <li>When the temperature is appropriate (around 100 degrees C), drop one or 2 drops
of acid in the epoxy pocket we just drilled. Wait until there is no more acid,
and continue to apply acid when that happens</li>
  <li>Every once in a while, grab the IC with plastic tweezers, dip it in acetone
and move it around to remove the reacted epoxy</li>
</ol>

<p>Results: <strong>Terrible</strong></p>

<p>A simple acetone bath and some stirring are not enough to …</p></div></div>

<p>In 2015 I wrote a paper called “<a href="http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/allen_downey.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Will Millennials Ever Get Married?</a>” where I used data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to estimate the age at first marriage for women in the U.S, broken down by decade of birth. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I found that women born in the 1980s and 90s were getting married later than previous cohorts, and I generated projections that suggest they are on track to stay unmarried at substantially higher rates.</p>



<p>Here are the results from that paper, based on 58 488 women surveyed between 1983 to 2015:</p>

<p>Each line represents a cohort grouped by decade of birth.  For example, the top line represents women born in the 1940s.</p>



<p>The colored segments show the fraction of women who had ever been married as a function of age.  For example, among women born in the 1940s, 82% had been married by age 25.  Among women born in the 1980s, only 41% had been married by the same age.</p>



<p>The gray lines show projections I generated by assuming that going forward each cohort would be subject to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis#Hazard_function_and_cumulative_hazard_function">hazard function</a> of the previous cohort. This method is likely to overestimate marriage rates.</p>



<p>These results show two trends:</p>



<ul><li>Each cohort is getting married later than the previous cohort.</li><li>The fraction of women who never marry is increasing from one cohort to the next.  </li></ul>



<h3>New data</h3>



<p>Yesterday the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) released a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2017_2019_puf.htm" target="_blank">new batch of data from surveys conducted in 2017-2019</a>. &nbsp;So we can compare the predictions from 2015 with the new data, and generate updated predictions.</p>



<p>The following figure shows the predictions from the previous figure, which are based on data up to 2015, compared to the new curves based on data up to 2019, which includes 70 183 respondents.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4.png 1800w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage4-4-1024x683.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Percentage of women ever married, based on data up to 2019, <br>compared to predictions based on data up to 2015.</figcaption></figure>



<p>For women born in the 1980s, the fraction who have married is almost exactly as predicted.  For women born in the 1990s, it is substantially lower.  </p>



<h3>New projections</h3>



<p>The following figure shows projections based on data up to 2019.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png 1024w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-405x270.png 405w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4.png 1800w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/marriage5-4-1024x683.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Percentage of women ever married, based on data up to 2019,<br>with predictions based on data up to 2019.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The vertical dashed lines show the ages where we have the last reliable estimate for each cohort.  The following table summarizes the results at age 28:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 28</td><td>87%</td><td>80%</td><td>70%</td><td>63%</td><td>55%</td><td>31%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 28, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The percentage of women married by age 28 has dropped quickly from each cohort to the next, by about 11 percentage points per decade.  </p>



<p>The following table shows the same percentage at age 38; the last value, for women born in the 1990s, is a projection based on the data we have so far.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 38</td><td>92%</td><td>88%</td><td>85%</td><td>80%</td><td>68%</td><td><em>51%</em></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 38, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on current trends, we expect barely half of women born in the 1990s to be married before age 38.</p>



<p>Finally, here are the percentages of women married by age 48; the last two values are projections.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Decade of birth</th><th>1940s</th><th>1950s</th><th>1960s</th><th>1970s</th><th>1980s</th><th>1990s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>% married <br>before age 48</td><td>&gt;93%</td><td>&gt;90%</td><td>88%</td><td>83%</td><td><em>72%</em></td><td><em>58%</em></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Percentage of women married by age 48, grouped by decade of birth.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Based on current trends, we expect women born in the 1980s and 1990s to remain unmarried at rates substantially higher than previous generations.</p>



<p>Projections like these are based on the assumption that the future will be like the past, but of course, things change.  In particular:</p>



<ul><li>These data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic. Marriage rates in 2020 will probably be lower than predicted, and the effect could continue into 2021 or beyond.</li><li>However, as economic conditions improve in the future, marriage rates might increase.</li></ul>



<p>We’ll find out when we get the next batch of data in October 2022.</p>

<p>A few months back, a controversy resurfaced in the world of tech. The controversy centered on the use of language and history at <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/problem-putting-worlds-code-github/">the world’s largest repository for open-source code</a>, GitHub. Developers from around the world had begun to reiterate their opposition to the default “master” branch convention GitHub used in its version control system. This month, after years of inaction, <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-main-starting-in-october-what-developers-need-to-know/">GitHub will officially change its default branch names from master to main</a>. To many, this change is long overdue. But to a significant number of people, the change is unnecessary. Because GitHub does not expressly use the word “slave” in its architecture, these developers argue, the use of master is anodyne. <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx">Message boards are still filled with commentators arguing this very point.</a> If the issue of master branches and version control systems confuses you, you’re not alone. In Part I (On Git, GitHub and Master-Slave) more context is given into what can be obscure subjects, providing an explanation as to what GitHub is and how the term “master” has been applied in version control systems.</p>

<p>For now, what can be said is that, despite <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">GitHub having decided to transition to other terminology</a>, a slim few in either party have gone so far as to write about the history of these words as applied to technology. If they had, they would have found that, as far as we know, master-slave language had only entered technological vernacular in the 20th century. Part II (Master-Slave in the 20th Century) elaborates on the best available research to be found on the history of master-slave terminology in the engineering and technological fields during the 20th century. Relying on keywords in patents, I review evidence into what might be the first modern use of master-slave terminology in the engineering context. I also explore which scientific fields began and continue to use “master-slave” terminology.</p>

<p>To truly understand how master-slave terminology could have emerged, requires a deeper exploration of history. For that reason, in Part III (<em>Dominus Machina</em>—The Scientific Revolution and Hierarchical Thinking) a more extensive review of the Scientific Revolution is made. Here I explore how socio-economic uncertainties during the 16th and 17th centuries laid the groundwork for a new hierarchical philosophy, promulgated by popular thinkers such as Sir Francis Bacon, in which man (in the gendered sense) had the divine right to dominate and enslave the earth for the purpose of progress and the accumulation of knowledge. This hierarchical thinking was adapted throughout the centuries to fit contemporaneous social beliefs. From racial hierarchies to anthropometry, phrenology, and Social Darwinism, dominance terminology and hierarchical thinking that emerged in the 17th century had become a tradition of the academic and technological sectors of the English-speaking world.</p>

<p>After reading this essay, I hope it becomes clear why master and master-slave terminology continues to be used in 2020. This post is not meant to rehash a debate about the use of master and master-slave branching. Frankly, it seems clear that the terms should never have been used. Neither is this post meant to characterize all hierarchical thinking as evil. Instead, the aim of this essay is to, respectfully, establish a fuller contextual history about the development of “master-slave” terminology in tech, and hierarchical thought in the sciences more generally. This is a difficult task because there is large portion of history to cover. In this essay, I concentrate on the roots of master-slave terminology in science which comes at the expense of more modern history. In the future, I hope to write more about our recent past.<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> More importantly, however, is that this topic matters deeply to many individuals—as it should. It is my hope that I have chosen my words respectfully and made my points accurately. To properly grasp the essence of this history, however, one must first understand the core service GitHub provides.</p>



<p>In the course of a program’s existence, developers often make many iterative changes to their code. Sometimes a change in the code will break the program, or a function, or a feature therein. In such cases, it is often helpful to have access to a previous, working version of the code in which to revert. For this and many other reasons,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup> there exists the concept of <strong>version control</strong>—the recording and management of changes to code and documents.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">3</a></sup> Since 2005 a primary tool for version control has been <strong>Git</strong>—a decentralized version control system (“Distributed Version Control”) in which the historical ledger of program alterations are retained by both remote and local servers. Soon after its open-source release, Git became the most used version control system in the world.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Helping in the ascent of Git was GitHub.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">5</a></sup> Established in 2008, GitHub provided developers using Git’s open-source software a means to host their code in remote repositories—libraries of files and documents—for free, while adding useful features like the ability to collaborate with other developers on the same projects. It also provided premium benefits to commercial ventures. Riding a wave of Big Data integration and open-source use throughout the 2010’s, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-15/github-said-to-seek-2-billion-valuation-in-latest-financing">by 2015 it was estimated that GitHub was worth $2 billion</a>. In 2018 the company was acquired by Microsoft for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/">$7.5 billion in Microsoft stock</a>.</p>



<p>In acquiring GitHub, however, Microsoft also inherited its customs. A key feature of Git, and of GitHub by proxy, is how information is stored. The initial “commit” of data to a repository creates a tree, or hierarchy, of information “snapshots” which are pointed to by a reference variable (called a HEAD). From this tree begins an initial development “branch” under which each new commit of information is stored. In Git, and GitHub, this first branch (there can be many branches) is by default given the name “master.” As the initial branch to each project, the “master branch” has to many become tied to the idea of storing their information hierarchically in GitHub.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">6</a></sup> And there’s the rub: for the common use of master to many people—especially people of color—evokes a shameful period in American history and breeds an atmosphere of intolerance and inequality <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/12/six-years-into-diversity-reports-big-tech-has-made-little-progress.html">in an already unrepresentative field</a>.</p>

<p>So, is it true? Is the etymological root of master, in this context, oppressive in nature? Working against an anodyne interpretation of master is the common use of “master-slave” terminology in much of the technology sector—context that is often <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53050955">conveniently omitted from justifications about the use of master.</a> For example, it does not take much research to discover that the creator of Git, Linus Torvalds, <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story">is known to have sourced the inspiration of Git from a commercial version-control system called BitKeeper</a>. BitKeeper <a href="https://github.com/bitkeeper-scm/bitkeeper/blob/master/doc/HOWTO.ask#L223">calls its branches and repositories masters and slaves</a>.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">7</a></sup> True, there are no “slave” conventions used in Git or GitHub, but this does not indemnify either from their reliance upon the use of master—it simply implies that those who use the term are ignorant of its origin.</p>



<p>For some, this reasoning will fall short: yes, the root of master in Git may originate with the master-slave paradigm, but it is no longer used in this sense—so let’s move on. Commonly left out of this reasoning, however, is an answer to the following question: why use master-slave terminology at all? Why do GitHub, BitKeeper, or any other company for that matter rely on such terms? And, who started using such terminology? To this last question, some have sought an answer. It turns out the use of these specific terms seems to have emerged only in the quite recent past.</p>



<p>In 2007, a fascinating article was published out of the University of Michigan. The article, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236752849_Broken_Metaphor_The_Master-Slave_Analogy_in_Technical_Literature">“Broken Metaphor: The Master-Slave Analogy in Technical Literature”</a>, had a simple conceit: to explore the history of master-slave terminology by studying patents throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The article’s author, Ron Eglash, a professor of ethnomathematics, had a wider focus than <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-photo-preview-algorithmic-racial-bias/">current hot-button issues such as algorithmic bias</a>. Practitioners of the field of <strong>ethnomathematics</strong> like Eglash study the etymology and social interactivity between mathematics and culture throughout the world. In his article, Eglash was concerned not simply with the use of master-slave, but how the terms were generated.</p>



<p>As far as Eglash could tell, there were no references to master-slave terminology before the American Civil War. The earliest instance he could find occurred in a 1904 patent for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time">sidereal clock</a>—a timekeeping system to locate celestial objects—by the astronomer David Gill in Cape Town, South Africa. According to the patent’s language, the clock “consists of two separate instruments: (a) a pendulum (swinging in a nearly airtight enclosure maintained at uniform temperature and pressure) and (b) the ‘slave clock’ with wheel train and dead-beat escapement.”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7">8</a></sup> The association of master-slave terminology with South Africa may sound nefarious due to its history, but, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236752849_Broken_Metaphor_The_Master-Slave_Analogy_in_Technical_Literature">to Eglash, we should consider the following</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although today we associate South Africa with the racism of apartheid, at the time Gill wrote slavery had been outlawed in the Cape Colony for over …</p></blockquote></div></article></div></div></div>

<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preface</h2>
<p>My goal for this article is to help you solve technical interview problems
similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate all subsets of a given set</li>
<li>Generate all strings over a given alphabet of a given fixed length</li>
<li>Generate all strings over a given alphabet (of any length)</li>
<li>Generate all permutations of a given set</li>
<li>Generate all combinations of a given length and a given set</li>
<li>Generate all balanced parentheses of a given length</li>
<li>Generate all binary trees with a given number of nodes</li>
</ul>
<p>These problems fall under the category of "combinatorial generation" problems,
since you are asked to generate all the elements of a set of combinatorial
objects (subsets, strings, combinations, permutations, trees, graphs, etc.).</p>
<p>The topic of combinatorial generation is a rich field of study and here I do
not intend to do it any real justice. For rigorous and much more comprehensive
treatments of the subject I recommend Knuth's or Ruskey's books on the subject.
See the Further Reading section for references. Instead, I intend to provide
a bare minimum, approachable, and practical guide that will prepare you to
approach combinatorial generation problems you might encounter during coding
interviews, and to provide you with the basic tools and vocabulary needed to
analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.</p>
<p>I chose to write this post for several reasons. First, I noticed combinatorial
generation problems are commonly asked during coding interviews. I myself have
been asked variations of combinatorial generation problems on at least six or
seven coding interviews that I remember. I suspect their popularity as
interview questions has to do with the fact that most of the problems have
fairly simple and elegant solutions that are well within reach during a
45-minute coding interview. However, reaching any elegant solution requires
clarity of thought, good pattern recognition, a solid understanding of
recursion, as well as solid coding skills, in particular comfortable handling
of indexes, and general list or string manipulation. There are often many ways
of solving a problem, with different levels of space and time complexity
trade-off. All of this leads to a problem area that is well-suited for gauging
a candidates overall algorithmic thinking and coding aptitude.</p>
<p>Second, the topic is often not given proper treatment as part of most computer
science programs. Because of this, I noticed most candidates are somewhat
ill-prepared to solve problems in this space. While some students might have
encountered a few examples in the space as part of recursion or backtracking
topics, the problems are almost never given focused attention by themselves.
This article is meant to fill that gap.</p>
<p>Third, I believe the subject matter to be a fantastic playground for exploring
ideas and learning more about coding, combinatorics, algorithms, recursion, and
time and space complexity analysis, for reasons very similar to those making
the subject area a good fit for coding interview questions. As such,
combinatorial generation problems provide an excellent excuse to practice and
hone coding and algorithmic skills. This article is intended to be an
invitation to this playground, providing an approachable and gentle
introduction using very readable code in Python.</p>
<p>To make the post useful and practical, I start by providing a brief description
of two approaches to solving combinatorial generation problems, and then dive
into multiple examples, applying both approaches to each example and then
briefly discussing the time and space complexity of each solution. I also
provide many exercises as we progress to give you an opportunity to challenge
yourself and test your understanding of the material.</p>
<!-- I recommend you try to solve the example problems on your own before reading my -->
<!-- solutions, or at least go back and try to implement the solutions from memory -->
<!-- and based on your understanding afterwards, without looking at the source code -->
<!-- I provide. Ultimately, as Feynman said, you do not really understand it unless -->
<!-- you can create it yourself. -->

<div id="preliminaries">
<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminaries</h2>
<div id="two-approaches-to-combinatorial-generation">
<h3>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Approaches To Combinatorial Generation</h3>
<p>In this post we will look at two approaches to solving combinatorial generation
problems. Let's consider both of them here briefly.</p>
<p><strong>Recursive</strong>: The problems you are likely to encounter during coding
interviews are very likely to have very simple recursive solutions. The
recursive solution is often based on simple observations about the recursive
structure of the combinatorial set you are generating. At times, the recursive
solution can be as simple as literally following the definition of the
combinatorial set. Combinatorial objects are often defined recursively, for
example, consider the definition of a binary tree. The recursive solutions
often suffer from exponential space usage (or exponential time, or both,
depending on implementation). However, they are often very very simple to
implement, requiring minimal code and are also readable and easy to understand.
As such, you should make sure you master the basic recursive solutions and
provide them as the first solution.  This way you will have at least one
working solution by the end of the interview (which will, in my experience of
interviewing candidates, set you apart from the majority of candidates).
Ideally, you should aim to provide a simple recursive solution in 5 to 10
minutes at most, leaving the majority of the rest of the interview time to
space and time complexity analysis and to provide the improved iterative
solution.</p>
<p><strong>Iterative</strong>: In the iterative approach, we move from one object to the next
by modifying the object in-place. A common iterative approach is to generate
all objects in lexicographic order. This approach has several benefits. First,
since the generation is done by modifying the input in-place, space complexity
is often constant or at least not exponential.  Second, it produces the objects
in lexicographic order, meaning the output objects are guaranteed to be in
sorted order. Furthermore, by formulating the problem as how to move from one
object to the next in lexicographic order, we can come up with a general
problem solving strategy that works for many problems. To quote Knuth,
"lexicographic order usually suggests the most convenient way to generate
combinatorial configurations" (The Art Of Computer Programming, Volume 4,
section 7.2.1.3).</p>
<p>We will approach multiple example problems using both the above approaches and
analyze their time and space complexity. Hopefully by the end of the article,
both approaches will be second nature to you and provide systematic way of
approaching any combinatorial generation problem you might encounter.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-and-space-complexity-of-generation-algorithms">
<h3>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time And Space Complexity Of Generation Algorithms</h3>
<p>Time and space complexity analysis is slightly different for combinatorial
generation problems. In most cases, the output is exponential in size (or
infinite at times), and hence as a whole the program must run in exponential
time to generate all the objects (or run indefinitely until terminated
externally, in cases of generating infinite sets). Because of this, we will
often consider time needed to generate <em>each</em> object in the set (on average, or
worst case). Similarly, we will look at the maximum space needed by the program
at any point during its execution. For programs that need to run indefinitely
(i.e., ones that generate infinite sets), we look at how space usage grows as
the program keeps on running.</p>
<p>Similar to the two approaches to solving the problems, this more nuanced
approach to time and space complexity will also be made more clear by looking
at multiple examples.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-generate-means">
<h3>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What "Generate" Means</h3>
<p>It is important at this point to clarify what we mean by "generate". The
simplest way to generate the objects is to simply put all the output into a
list or in-memory collection of some sort and returned that collection.
However, we obviously can not improve space complexity to be better than the
size of the output set (which is often exponential), if we want to keep all the
generated objects in memory at once. Therefore, for the purposes of problems
like this, "generate" can mean any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place the resulting objects all in a list and return the list.</li>
<li>Print a representation of each object to standard output.</li>
<li>Yield each object using a generator.</li>
<li>Visit each object by calling a provided <tt>visit</tt> function with the object
passed as the argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, when we try to avoid unnecessary (and often exponential)
memory usage, we will use a simple generator pattern and yield each resulting
object instead of placing them in an in-memory collection. You read about
Python's generators in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">PEP 255</a>.
As the name of the pattern suggests, Python generators are very well-suited for
combinatorial generation.</p>
</div>
<div id="output-order">
<h3>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output Order</h3>
<p>A good clarifying question to ask for combinatorial generation problems is
whether there is an expectation on the order of the output objects. You might
learn that the output order does not matter, or the interviewer might ask the
output to be in lexicographic (i.e., dictionary) order. Rarely, you might also
come across a problem that asks for an order that minimizes the difference
between two subsequent objects. This order is often referred to as Gray order,
named after Bell Labs researcher Frank Gray. I hope to write a follow-up to
this post at some point to go over some examples of Gray order generation. For
now, in our basic recursive solutions we tend to not worry about the order of
the output, and just ensure every object is generated exactly once. For our
second approach, we, by definition of the approach, only generate objects in
lexicographic order.</p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed Length Strings Given An Alphabet</h2>
<div id="problem-definition">
<h3>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem Definition</h3>
<p>Let's start by looking at a simple problem: given an alphabet <tt>A</tt> which is
guaranteed to be a non-empty list of distinct single character strings, and a
non-negative integer <tt>n</tt>, generate all strings of length <tt>n</tt>. For
example, given <tt>A = ['0', '1', '2']</tt> and <tt>n = 2</tt> we expect the output to be:</p>

<p>To make sure the question is clear, let's look at another example. Given <tt>A =
['a', 'b']</tt> and <tt>n = 3</tt> we expect the output to be:</p>

  <h2>Does remote work mean reduced cost or increased risk? Here are some arguments about employees being ready to take a pay cut to continue working remotely. </h2>
  
  <p><img src="https://remote-tools-images.s3.amazonaws.com/Contract+negotiation.png" width="100%" max-width="700px" alt="Pay cut to work remotely"></p><p>Let me start by asking you a question. Say, your employer is ready to offer you the perk of permanent remote work but asks you to take a pay cut (5-20%), would you take it?
</p>
<p>Hanadi <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely">sparked this discussion</a> by sharing an interesting stat that 45% of UK employees are indeed ready to take a pay cut to continue working remotely.</p>

<p>Let's first look at some of the arguments for the proposal.</p><br>

<h2>1) Remote working = reduced costs. So, your net take home pay is still the same.</h2>

<p>Employers argue that remote working results in:</p>

<ul><li>Reduced transportation expenses</li>
<li>Less money spent on meals or outings with co-workers</li>
<li>Tax concessions given you have a home office</li>
<li>Reduced miscellaneous expenses like dry cleaning, wardrobe etc.</li></ul>
<p>So effectively your take-home pay is still the same or even higher.</p>
<br>
<h3>Counter</h3>
<p>
- Companies also save significant costs when employees work remotely. So looking at just reduced expenses for employees is a narrow, one-sided view.
</p>
<p>- On the contrary, individuals now have to pay extra for setting up their home office, additional bills, backup connections, co-working passes etc. So employers should in fact seriously consider reimbursing these expenses rather than thinking of a salary cut.</p>

<br><h2>2) Remote work = increased risk. The risk &amp; lack of trust is built into the pay cut and subsequent lower salary</h2>

<p>Jordan made this argument that <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely#c_nezpjo">a remote hire comes with added risk</a>. When you hire someone who doesn't meet your standard but works in office, there's still a possibility to manage or correct that since it's easier to have constant informal contact. The bigger risk with remote working is hence built into the salary.</p>
<br>
<h3>Counter</h3>

<p>- While the argument of additional risk might be accurate, proposing a lower salary doesn't solve the root problem.</p>

<p>- Instead companies could do either of the two:</p>
<ul><li>Don't compromise on hiring. Hire only the best remotely. While companies like GitLab, Doist etc. have been doing this for years, the same may not be possible for smaller startups.
 </li>
<li>Karthik &amp; Jordan <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely#c_fcx9cy">suggested a compromise on the same thread</a> where you negotiate a lower pay with the candidate for an initial probationary period. You also commit to a pay raise after the initial period.</li></ul>
<br>
<h3>For companies, pay cut for remote work could be a serious disadvantage</h3>

<p>Boris accurately pointed that it's <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely#c_9wee3g">hard to convince people to switch jobs by going down in salary</a>. On the contrary, people expect at least 10-20% raise to change jobs.</p>

<p>Now, if you decide to cut down the pay of your existing employees for offering the perk of remote work, it will likely result in unhappy employees and start showing negative effects in their work.</p>

<p>Companies are seeing this all wrong when they think of lower pay in return for the benefit of working remotely. Sure it's a perk for employees but that shouldn't mean a compromise elsewhere. Instead companies should push employees to bring out the best version of themselves &amp; perform even better now that employees have this additional freedom.</p>

<p>Microsoft's new remote work policy actually gets this right. Read <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/r7pmum/simple_is_powerful">more about it here</a>.</p>

<p>I am sure you would have something to add to these arguments. <a target="_blank" href="https://remoteclan.com/s/iefkjf/taking_pay_cut_work_remotely">Head over to this thread</a> to share your thoughts.</p>

<title>The Myth of RAM, part I</title>
# The Myth of RAM, part I
<p id="date">April 21, 2014</p>


## Preface
This article is the first of four in a series, in which I argue that thinking of a memory access as _O(1)_ is generally a bad idea, and we should instead think of them as taking _O(√N)_ time. In part one I lay out a hand-wavy argument based on a benchmark. In [part II](2014_04_28_myth_of_ram_2.html) I build up a mathematical argument based in theoretical physics, and in [part III](2014_04_29_myth_of_ram_3.html) I investigate some implications. [Part IV](2015_02_09_myth_of_ram_4.html) is a FAQ in which I answers some common questions and misunderstandings.

(This preface was added on August 29, 2016)


## Intro
If you have studied computing science, then you know how to do [complexity analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms#Run-time_analysis). You'll know that the time complexity for iterating through a linked list is _O(N)_, binary search is _O(log(N))_ and a hash table lookup is _O(1)_. What if I told you that all of the above is not just misleading, but wrong? What if I told you that the time it takes to iterate through a linked list is actually _O(N√N)_ and hash lookups are _O(√N)_?

Don't believe me? By the end of this series of articles you will. I will show you that accessing memory is not a _O(1)_ operation but _O(√N)_. This is a result that holds up both in theory and practice. Let’s start with the latter:



## Measuring it
First of all, let's get our definitions straight. [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) can be applied to many things, from memory usage to instructions executed. For the purpose of this series of articles I'll be using the _O(f(N))_ to mean that _f(N)_ is an upper bound (worst case) of the *time* it takes to accomplish a task accessing _N_ bytes of memory (or, equivalently, _N_ number of equally sized elements). That I use Big O to analyze _time_ and not _operations_ is important. As we'll see, the CPU spends a lot of time waiting for memory. Personally, I do not care what the CPU does while I wait for it – I only care about how long something takes, hence the definition above.

Another clarification: the "RAM" in the title is meant to refer to random memory accesses in general, not to a specific type of memory. In this installment I measure the time it takes to access a piece of memory be it in cache, in DRAM, or in swap. In Part II I will extend this even further – but I'm getting ahead of myself.

[Here’s a simple program](https://github.com/emilk/ram_bench) that iterates through a linked list of length _N_, ranging from 64 elements up to about 420 million elements. Each node consists of a 64 bit pointer and 64 bits of dummy data. The nodes of the linked list are jumbled around in memory so that each memory access is random. I measure iterating through the same list a few times, and then plot the time taken per element. This means that we should get a flat plot if random memory access is _O(1)_. This is what we actually get:

![The cost of accessing one node in a linked list of a given size. Accessing a random element in a 100MB list is approximately 100 times slower than accessing an element in a 10kB list.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/1_data.png)

Note that this is a log-log graph, so the differences are actually pretty huge. We go from about one nanosecond per element all they way up to a microsecond! But why? The answer, of course, is caching. The system memory (RAM) is actually pretty slow and far away and so to compensate the clever computer designers have added a hierarchy of faster, closer and more expensive caches to speed things up. My computer has three levels called L1, L2, L3 of 32 kiB, 256 kiB and 4 MiB each. I have 8 GiB of RAM, but when I ran my experiment I only had about 6 GiB free – so in the last runs there was some swapping to disk (an SSD). Here’s the same plot again but with my RAM and cache sizes added as vertical lines:

![The vertical lines corresponds to L1=32kiB, L2=256kiB, L3=4MiB and 6 GiB of free RAM.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/2_caches.png)

This graph should really drive home the importance of cache:s – each cache is many times faster than the previous one. This is the reality of modern CPU architectures, be it on smartphones, laptops or mainframes. But what is the pattern? Can we fit some simple equation to the plot? It turns out we can! If you look at the plot you'll see that between 10kB and 1MB there is a roughly a 10x slowdown. Between 1 MB and 100 MB there is another 10x slowdown – and again between 100 MB and 10 GB! It seems like that for each 100-fold increase in memory usage we get a 10-fold slow-down. Let's superimpose that on the graph:

![The blue line is _O(√N)_.](2014_04_21_myth_of_ram_1/3_fit.png)

The blue line corresponds to a _O(√N)_ cost of each memory access. Seems like a pretty good fit, no? Of course this is on my machine, and it may look quite different on yours. Still, the equation is very simple to remember, so maybe we could use it as a rule of thumb.

You may now wonder what will happen once we hit the right side of the graph. Will it keep climbing, or plateauing? Well, it would plateau for a while until we could no longer fit the memory on SSD and would need to go to HDD, then a disk server, then a data-center far away etc. Each such jump would create a new plateau, but the upwards trend of the latency, I will argue, would continue. The reason I did not run my experiment further is simply lack of time and lack of access to a big data-center.

"But", I hear you say, "empiricism is no way to establish a Big-O bound!". It certainly isn't! Could there perhaps be a theoretical limit to the latency of a memory access? The plot thickens in [The Myth of RAM, part II](2014_04_28_myth_of_ram_2.html).

			<p>In this video blog I talk about the persistent question of “the killer
app” that gets asked in the Emacs community.  I explain why I think the
identification of a single package is often not enough to appreciate the
true value proposition of Emacs.  My case emphasises the importance of
workflows; workflows that typically combine lots of distinct tools and
benefit from core Emacs attributes.  It is the whole system that
matters, because all those packages—in their given combinations—make
up our day-to-day computing experience with Emacs.</p>

<p>The text of the presentation is written in <code>org-mode</code> notation and is
reproduced below.  Also check my Emacs configuration file, from where
you can get the code I use: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: Vlog: Emacs is my “favourite Emacs package”
#+AUTHOR: Protesilaos Stavrou · protesilaos.com

* Getting into the Emacs mindset

I will to talk to you about my approach to a recurring topic in the
Emacs community, best encapsulated in this question:

/What is your favourite package?/

Similar formulations:

+ What is the one thing that makes Emacs indispensable to you?
+ Which is Emacs' killer app?

Such questions can lead us to valuable findings.  There is truth to be
had in the insights drawn from them and we must learn as much as we can
in the process.

Note though that this type of inquiry expects from us to engage in an
analytical exercise that extracts an object from its milieu.  It puts us
in a frame of mind that can miss the true value proposition of Emacs.

The problématique comes with the latent risk of holding us captive to a
frame of mind characterised by *decontextualisation*, of examining an
object without reference to the environment that renders it possible.

Instead of thinking about workflows that can take you from one context
to another, we are expected to identify some silo of functionalities.
Are we then underestimating everything else that contributes to our
day-to-day /experience/ with Emacs?

* Don't ignore the forest while looking at the tree

Now before I get misunderstood: yes, Org and Magit are great; yes, there
are lots of individual packages that make your life easier; and yes,
there is value in finding which package[s] people enjoy the most.

What about the combination of all utilities?  What about the *gestalt*?

If you claim that “my favourite package is X” and then fail to couch
your statement in terms of the rest of the toolkit you rely on, you are
likely to underappreciate---or altogether ignore---the true value
proposition of Emacs.

You do not acknowledge how the whole system is pieced together.  More
importantly, you may not realise the potential of Emacs' extensibility,
which is dynamic or case-dependent.

In other words, Emacs provides the means to implement a metaphor like
that of the vaunted Unix pipes across its entire space.  In practical
terms, you can connect your email client to your agenda, your RSS reader
to your custom note-taking system, your music manager to your directory
editor, and so on.  And all these can benefit from interfaces for
searching, editing in bulk, etc.

My claim here is that most of the times there is no one package or
narrow subset that make Emacs great.  It rather is the linkages between
several pieces of code that make Emacs a pleasure to work with.  They
contribute to predictable-yet-flexible workflows.  These keep Emacs
relevant and, dare I say, intriguing.

* The three core attributes of Emacs

Emacs is programmable and introspectable.  Both presuppose transparency.
These make the Emacs experience open-ended.

+ Programmable :: One set of features can be made to interface with
  another, even though it was not conceived with the express purpose of
  optimising for that particular scenario.  What can be done with Emacs
  is not predetermined.  There is always scope for something new.

+ Introspectable :: The user can examine the entire code base or a
  specific implementation and, potentially, figure out how to connect to
  it through some other tool.  This is further supported by the robust
  self-documentation facilities of Emacs, as well as the high quality of
  material that is readily available through the built-in Info reader.
  Introspection has contributed to the /documentation culture/ that
  characterises the Emacs community at-large.

+ Transparent :: Emacs does not conceal its internals.  Virtually every
  case can be handled using the same language the code is written in
  (Emacs Lisp) while benefiting from live evaluation of new code.  You
  change something and you see it in action.  Combined with the
  self-documenting nature of Emacs, transparency provides insight into
  practically every single construct that makes up Elisp.  Which
  empowers us to make best use of Emacs' programmability.

When considered together, these engender the *interconnectedness* that
defines the Emacs space.
* Introspection in action

Quick demo of running =C-h o= (=describe-symbol=) over =mapcar= and =mapconcat=
and then testing those expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapcar #'upcase '("one" "two" "three"))

(mapconcat #'upcase '("one" "two" "three") "-")
#+end_src

We can use =C-x C-e= (=eval-last-sexp=) to get live feedback of what each
function does.

We can check the log with =C-h e= (=view-echo-area-messages=).

These are the rudimentary tools you rely on to start using ELisp.  They
offer you the means to experiment with how to extend Emacs.
* A quick look at combining tools

Now let me switch to another window layout, where I have some plain text
files in a standard directory.  Nothing fancy here.  Just to show how
standard Emacs tools can combine together to deliver a consistent
computing experience.

+ Switching to another layout involves the built-in tabs (=tab-bar-mode=)
  plus some bespoke code of mine.
+ Find file at point using a filename or just part of a file (=C-x C-f M-n=).
+ Use a completion framework (=icomplete-mode= in my case).
+ Benefit from a pattern-matching style (=orderless= for me).
+ Jump to the directory that contains the file (=dired-jump=).
+ While in Dired, jump to an item using completion (=dired-goto-file=).
+ Or filter the Dired list and then find the item (=% m= potentially
  followed by =t k=).

* Interconnectedness in the Emacs space

My point is to highlight the true value of Emacs' extensibility.  Which
is realised in the connections you make between several pieces of
functionality.

And, as I already mentioned, one package does not need to know about the
presence of another /in advance/.

Your focus should be on the workflow.  On the whole system that helps
you get things done with Emacs.  Because that is what your actual
experience is about.  You benefit from the set of /emergent qualities/
that become available in the combination of otherwise disparate pieces
of functionality.

Let me stress the importance of interconnectedness in the Emacs space by
showing you another quick demo that combines three distinct packages
that were not developed for the express purpose of being combined
together:

+ =elfeed= for reading RSS/Atom feeds.
+ =bongo= for managing media files or links.
+ And my own experimental note-taking system (=usls=).

Finally, this entire presentation is made possible by combining several
tools:

+ =org-mode=
+ =olivetti-mode=
+ =org-tree-slide-mode=
+ =variable-pitch-mode=
+ my own commands for setting fonts

    <blockquote>
  <p>If at first you don’t succeed, call it version 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RuboCop’s development started exactly 7 and half years ago. I made
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/commit/afbead34db54506c12a21dbd4ce04fada0f8b9a4#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947">the first
commit</a>
on April 21, 2012. That’s a lot of time in general, but even more in
the fast moving world of IT. During this long period we’ve racked up some
impressive numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9905</strong> commits</li>
  <li><strong>152</strong> releases</li>
  <li>around <strong>3500</strong> closed issues</li>
  <li>almost <strong>5000</strong> merged pull requests</li>
  <li>over <strong>120 million</strong> downloads</li>
  <li>over <strong>200</strong> publicly available related gems (extensions, custom configurations, etc)</li>
  <li>over <strong>700</strong> contributors</li>
</ul>

<p>I never expected any of this on April 21, 2012. If there’s a person truly
surprised by the success of RuboCop that’d be me. But wait, there’s more!
We also reached some important milestones in the last couple of years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq">RuboCop HQ organization</a> that became the home for RuboCop, the community style guides, and many popular RuboCop extensions</li>
  <li>Extracted the Rails cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-rails</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the performance cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-performance</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the AST-related functionality to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-ast</code>)</li>
  <li>Created new extensions focused on Rake (<code>rubocop-rake</code>) and Minitest (<code>rubocop-minitest</code>)</li>
  <li>Made significant improvements to RuboCop’s code formatting capabilities</li>
  <li>Reworked the cop API</li>
  <li>Switched to safe-only cops by default</li>
  <li>Introduced the notion of “pending” cops</li>
  <li>Created a brand new <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">documentation site</a></li>
  <li>Provided more polished versions of the community style guides over at <a href="https://rubystyle.guide/">https://rubystyle.guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing eluded us, though - a “stable” RuboCop release. Today this finally changes with
RuboCop 1.0!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There’s nothing ground-breaking about the new RuboCop release - it’s almost the same as RuboCop 0.93.1 that
preceded it. I believe the only change, that most of you are going to notice, is that all cops that used to be
“pending” are now enabled by default, which is in line with our release policy. No new cops will be enabled
by default until RuboCop 2.0.</p>

<p>The big news for end users and maintainers of extensions is that we’re finally embracing fully Semantic Versioning, which
should make the upgrade process simpler (painless?) for everyone. Going forward the following things will happen only on major releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabling of new cops</li>
  <li>changes to the default cop configuration</li>
  <li>breaking API changes</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s really funny that I felt for at least a couple of years that we were very close to the 1.0
release, only to come up with more and more things I wanted to include in it. I believe <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2018/presentations/bbatsov.html">I first spoke</a>
about my intentions to ship RuboCop 1.0 at RubyKaigi 2018 and back then I truly believed this was bound to happen in the next
6 months. Classic example of planning in the software development world, right?</p>

<p>Many people urged me for years to label a random release as 1.0 with
the argument that if some software is useful and widely used than it
probably deserves that magic moniker. It’s not a bad argument and I
totally understood the perspective of those people. I, however, was
not convinced as for me version 1.0 also stands for “we got to a place
we consider feature complete and aligned with our vision”.  Needless
to say - the vision we (RuboCop’s team) had was quite ambitious and it took us
a while to make it a reality.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to explain how happy I am that we got here, and I can
assure you that it wasn’t easy.  Over the years RuboCop had its ups
and downs, it got a lot of praise, but also a lot of flak.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Some
days I was super pumped and motivated to work on it, on other days I
couldn’t stand to think about it.  Working on popular OSS projects is
one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences that one
can have.  I was (un)fortunate enough to be involved in a few of those
(RuboCop, CIDER, nREPL, Projectile, Emacs Prelude, etc) and each one
was a crazy roller-coaster ride.</p>

<p>I find it funny how my role in RuboCop evolved with time. Originally I
used to write mostly code, these days I write mostly tickets,
issue/code review comments and documentation. Often I feel more like a
project manager rather than a programmer. There was a time when I was
super happy to see a PR and I’d immediately respond to it, now I can’t
keep up with all the PRs. In fact, our entire team can’t keep up with
them, so consider this my apology that it sometimes takes a while to
get feedback on your suggestions. I’ll even admit that I rarely read
issue tickets these days as there are so many of them and it’s
impossible for me to respond to all of them. I’ve just learned that
important tickets always get noticed, if not by me than by someone else from our
fantastic team.</p>

<p>I want to extend special thanks to RuboCop’s core team, as we would have never gotten so far without all those amazing people
working tirelessly on the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jonas054">Jonas Arvidsson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yujinakayama">Yuji Nakayama</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/edzhelyov">Evgeni Dzhelyov</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/drenmi">Ted Johansson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pocke">Masataka Kuwabara</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/koic">Koichi Ito</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/darhazer">Maxim Krizhanovski</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bquorning">Benjamin Quorning</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marcandre">Marc-André Lafortune</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You rock, guys!</p>

<p>Jonas, in particular, deserves just as much credit for RuboCop existing today as me. He was the first contributor to RuboCop and he
pushed me to get RuboCop to the state where it got critical mass, mindshare and some traction. It’s a long story for another day and another article.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Koichi also deserves a special mention for his tireless work and incredible dedication to RuboCop and its users over the years! And for his great karaoke skills!
He has also been a fantastic head maintainer for key RuboCop extensions like <code>rubocop-rails</code>, <code>rubocop-performance</code> and <code>rubocop-minitest</code>.</p>

<p>Last, but not least - another round of big thanks for all the people who contributed to RuboCop in any capacity over the years! RuboCop is all of you!
Keep those contributions coming!</p>

<p>Some closing notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned above, recently we’ve extracted RuboCop’s AST-related logic to the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-ast">rubocop-ast</a> gem, that’s going to be very handy for everything looking to supercharge
<a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">parser</a>’s API. I’d love to see more tools using it, as I think we really managed to simplify the interaction with an AST. Work on the new gem is led by the awesome Marc-André Lafortune. By the way, he released <code>rubocop-ast</code> 1.0 today! We have some cause for double celebration!</li>
  <li>The cop API was completely reworked recently by Marc-André. He did some truly fantastic work there! Check out the <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/v1_upgrade_notes.html">upgrade notes</a> if you maintain any RuboCop extensions, as the legacy API will be removed
in RuboCop 2.0.</li>
  <li>We’ve made some changes to how department names are calculated that might affect some extensions. Read more about them <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8490">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release notes</a> for all the details.</li>
  <li><code>rubocop-rspec</code> is currently not compatible with RuboCop 1.0, but we’re working on this. You can follow the progress on that front <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec/issues/1051">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s a wrap!</p>

<p>I feel a bit sorry for disappointing everyone who hoped we’d make it
to RuboCop 0.99, before cutting RuboCop 1.0. We did our best and we
had a great 0.x run, but we ran out of things to do.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> :-) On the bright side - now
I can finally say that I’ve got 99 problems (and 200 open issues), but cutting RuboCop 1.0 ain’t one.</p>

<p>Enjoy RuboCop 1.0 and share with us your feedback about it! Our focus now shifts to RuboCop 1.1, and I hope that we’ll be dropping
new major releases rather infrequently going forward (although RuboCop 2.0 will probably arrive in less than 7 years). Thanks for your help, love, feedback and
support! Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Koichi recently covered in great details our long journey to RuboCop 1.0 in his presentation <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/koic/road-to-rubocop-1-dot-0">Road to RuboCop 1.0</a> at RubyKaigi 2020. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those of you who’d like to learn more about the technical aspects of RuboCop 1.0 and all the challenges we had to solve along the way!</p>

        <div>
            

<p><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/iloTs/header.png" alt="Header"></p>

<p>Ilograph is written in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> because of the productivity and safety benefits it provides over standard Javascript. Over time, however, it has proven valuable in an unexpected, and big, way. Typescript has gone beyond being just the language Ilograph is written in; here are four ways it has actually influenced Ilograph’s very design.</p>

<h5 id="influence-1-at-home-good-or-the-problem-with-easy">Influence #1: At-Home Good (or, The Problem With “Easy”)</h5>

<p>In <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework">REWORK</a>, the founders of 37Signals (now called Basecamp) describe products that are “at-home good”. Such products, they say, are not merely easy to pick up and use; they go beyond “quick wins” and provide the kind of long-term benefits sought out by professionals.</p>

<p>Typescript is at-home good. As a superset of Javascript, it is, by definition, harder to learn than Javascript. There is also an up-front configuration cost, and annotating types in code requires keystrokes that Javascript does not. However, once developers get it “home” and really begin using it, the <a href="https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/getting-started/why-typescript">long-term payoffs</a> are enormous. Professional developers seek out these kinds of trade-offs. They do not (or at least should not) want “easy”, because “easy” doesn’t scale.</p>

<p>Using this as inspiration, Ilograph’s primary goal is to be “at-home good”. It is geared towards pros and designed to scale. For example, it does not use drag-and-drop; instead, users define <a href="https://www.ilograph.com/docs/editing/idl/">diagrams using code</a>. Drag-and-drop is easy to learn, but it doesn’t scale as well as code (rearranging boxes and fiddling with arrows and font sizes gradually becomes a nightmare).</p>

<p>Other features, like multi-perspective diagrams and resource inheritance allow advanced users to express things that simpler drag-and-drop tools do not. This is one of Ilograph’s “big bets”; it caters to a smaller pool of advanced users, but it is better tailored to their needs.</p>

<h5 id="influence-2-starting-with-a-model">Influence #2: Starting with a Model</h5>

<p>The eponymous feature of Typescript is that it allows developers to declare their data types in code. Using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html">interfaces</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html">types</a>, developers define what their data types look like, typically before writing the functional code that uses those types. The data types and functional code then usually evolve together over the course of development. Javascript, by contrast, does not support this and data types are implicit (or, at best, checked only at runtime).</p>

<p>Together, all of the explicitly-declared types in a Typescript program form a <strong>model</strong>. This model is the foundation of the codebase; the functional code depends on this model, but not vice-versa.</p>

</figure>


<p>Using this as inspiration, Ilograph diagrams also start with a <a href="https://www.ilograph.com/docs/editing/resources/">model</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Users declare what resources <strong>are</strong> before declaring how they are related (in <a href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.Ilograph/Request">Relational perspectives</a>) and their behaviors (in <a href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.Ilograph/Get%2520Diagram">Sequence perspectives</a>). Like in Typescript, users give resources both a name and a type (in the form of a subtitle and/or icon) since both are important. This explicitness not only improves developer and viewer understanding, but also improves developer tooling.</p>

<h5 id="influence-3-the-developer-experience">Influence #3: The Developer Experience</h5>

<p>Typescript may be harder to <em>learn</em> than Javascript (see above), but its design enables tooling that makes it easier to work with. The most prominent example is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/typescript">autocomplete</a>, which offers more precise suggestions and catches more errors when using Typescript compared to Javascript. This instant feedback gives the developer “micro wins” and helps keep them in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/iloTs/autocomplete.png" alt="Autocomplete"></p>

<p>For the same reasons, Ilograph has an integrated editor with auto-complete that leverages the diagram model. More critically, Ilograph diagrams are laid out automatically, freeing the designer from having to manually place elements, arrows and so on.</p>

<p>In all of these cases, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load">cognitive load</a> on the developer/designer is reduced. Whether programming or diagramming, the more the computer helps with the small things (syntax errors, diagram layout), the more the user can focus on the high-level goals they are trying to achieve.</p>

<h5 id="influence-4-built-to-change-and-built-to-last-a-paradox">Influence #4: Built-To-Change <em>and</em> Built-To-Last, a Paradox</h5>

<p>Ilograph currently has about 15,000 lines of Typescript code. I’d estimate that at least that many lines of code have been deleted or rewritten over its lifespan (4 years). Almost everything about the original app, including its appearance, editing experience, and even nomenclature are drastically different today.</p>

<p>That may sound like waste, but it’s actually a sign of a healthy app that is adapting to feedback and shifting priorities. The world changes, after all, and we must change along with it.</p>

<p>I can say with 100% confidence that Ilograph would not exist without Typescript; it has made making so many changes possible. Without these changes, Ilograph would have been abandoned long ago. That is the paradox: things that are built-to-change last. Things that aren’t die out.</p>

<p>This might be the biggest influence Typescript has had on Ilograph. Like Typescript applications, Ilograph diagrams are easy to change. Making diagrams easy to change means that they are more likely to be kept up-to-date and relevant, and are more likely to provide long-term value.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to reverse a video using FFmpeg because FFmpeg has a built-in <code>reverse</code> filter that can do this job for both audio and video! Let’s learn how in this tutorial and some gotcha’s that you should avoid. </p>



<h2>Reverse a Video using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Here it is! A simple one-liner that takes your video and reverses it. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i originalVideo.mp4 -vf reverse reversedVideo.mp4</code></code></pre>



<p>And if you want to reverse the audio and video, all you gotta do is use this command.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe <code><code><code>-i originalVideo.mp4 -vf reverse -af areverse reversedVideo.mp4</code></code></code></code></pre>



<p>It’s as simple as that. </p>



<p>I used it on the Parkjoy sequence downloaded from <a aria-label="xiph (opens in a new tab)" href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xiph</a>. Note, that the original video is in <code>y4m</code> format and I first transcoded it to H.264/AVC using <code>crf=1</code> and then added timestamps for this fun experiment. </p>



<p>If you want to learn how to add timestamps to your video using the <code>drawtext</code> filter, then <a href="https://ottverse.com/ffmpeg-drawtext-filter-dynamic-overlays-timecode-scrolling-text-credits/">read this tutorial on OTTVerse.com</a>. </p>



<p>Here is the original sequence </p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470236838" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>







<p>And here is the reversed sequence – fun right? </p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/470236943" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>
</div></figure>







<h2>Caution for Large Files</h2>



<p>The problem with the <code>reverse</code> filter is that it loads the sequence into memory and if you try this on large sequences, you could very easily run out of memory. </p>



<p>The solution for this is to split your video into small pieces or segments, reverse each of them, and join them in the reverse order (yea, remember that!). </p>



<p>If you don’t know how to cut a video into small pieces, check out our <a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/" target="_blank" aria-label="tutorial on trimming or cutting videos (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">tutorial on trimming or cutting videos</a>. </p>

                    <p>A while ago when I got some Raspberry Pi's, I had a ton of issues with power. I bought a YZXStudio USB power meter/analyzer and a USB load tester, and tested every charger and cable I owned. I found a TON of bad cables which I threw out</p><p>Most of the pictures here are actually from 2017, but I never made any posts about them. So if you see I have no USB-C, thats why</p><p>This isn't much of a review, but just a post to show you what you can do</p><p>Here I'm testing an Anker charger, this thing is great and never drops below 5v at all. You can see the load tester plugged into the analyzer</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 1000w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 1600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/2017-01-12-18.34.08.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Here is an example of a good USB cable, also an Anker cable. At 2.5a, its only dropped down to 4.9v</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/10/2020-10-19-18.24.14.JPG" alt="" srcset="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/2020-10-19-18.24.14.JPG 600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/2020-10-19-18.24.14.JPG 1000w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w1600/2020/10/2020-10-19-18.24.14.JPG 1600w, https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/size/w2400/2020/10/2020-10-19-18.24.14.JPG 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And here is a cheaper, bad cable. The cable feels thick, and looks good, but its clear they cheaped out on the conductors and/or connectors. At the same 2.5a, its only putting out 4.6v.

The answer is pretty obvious. Open Source rules the world and is a thriving example of how communities can collaborate to build incredible quality products in the open. Such values as transparency, quality, security, and collaboration have been Mudita’s core values from day one. There’s simply no other way for us to release software as to be transparent and open about it. There are many Open Source enthusiasts at Mudita and without Open Source community, we would never be able to make the company happen in the first place.</p><p>Our community has only reassured us that they value the principles of open software - here’s just a few of the quotes from the <a href="https://forum.mudita.com/t/open-source-muditaos/648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MuditaOS - Open Source topic on our forum</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Not going full FOSS (copyleft licenses) with all the community-based advantages (R&amp;D, promotion, bug fixing, trust on privacy, possible leading OS, etc.) would definitely be a huge and sad mistake for this well-thought project. - agent_libre</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Another great aspect would be allowing people to exchange code with Mudita on tools like GitHub. Open source community could even help you in making the product better and better, meet more individual needs, help in debugging, and the most important, allow us to stay free. - darkponay</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>As far as I am concerned, Mudita is not here to build up yet another technological jail; it’s about providing by default a benevolent, useful and non-attention-seeking framework - a caring philosophy, not another mind’s prison. - agent_libre</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>There are also those who believe that non-free software is inherently unethical and I think that’s a respectable point of view, especially when it comes to a device as necessary for daily life as a cellphone. - Matt_McArthur</em></p></blockquote><p>In terms of licensing, we decided to go for <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPL v3 (GNU General Public License v3.0)</a>. This is a strong copyleft license which obliges anyone who introduces changes to the code or uses the code for their own purposes in any form to make the complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, to be available in the open under the same license.</p><h3>Join the MuditaOS Developer Preview</h3><p>The MuditaOS code will be publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/mudita/MuditaOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> on the day we officially launch Mudita Pure and start shipping our phones to backers and customers. Before we go all out, we would like to invite our community for a Developer Preview of the code and documentation.</p><p>While you’re reading this blog post, we’re preparing the necessary infrastructure, guidelines, and spaces for the MuditaOS community to grow. We would love all Mudita community Open Source enthusiasts to <a href="https://choosemindfully.typeform.com/to/dx9opXx0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for the Developer Preview.</a> The number of places is limited - so register while you can. After you apply with your email you’ll receive a message explaining the next step.</p><p>During the Developer Preview, we’ll be asking you for feedback regarding our Open Source infrastructure, documentation, guides, etc. so that we can act on and be well prepared for the “Go live with Open Source” day.</p><p>What’s worth mentioning is that <strong>we'll award 10 of the most active Open Source contributors with a free Mudita Pure phone</strong> as soon as we'll be able to ship them. We reserve the freedom to subjectively decide which 10 community members were the most valuable contributors during the Developer Preview period. Contributions include documentation changes, bug fixes, and helping our team on creating and delivering features.

We want our whole community to celebrate the fact that we are going Open Source. This is why <strong>we have added an </strong><code><strong>opensource</strong></code><strong> -5% discount code</strong> available to use until the end of October inside our online store, on top of the existing discounts.</p><p>We hope that you’re as excited as we are about starting this Open Source journey! We look forward to working with you on the best possible operating system for Mudita Pure.</p><div><section><h3>Comments <span>(<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></h3><span>No comments here.

<blockquote><p><strong>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) offers a philosophy for operating reliable distributed systems, with admirable principles and practices. However, in only a few years SRE cargo culting has emerged at a level to rival DevOps cargo culting in the 2010s.&nbsp;<p>What is SRE as a Cult, and how does it intersect with DevOps as a Cult? Why is SRE so difficult to apply to enterprise organisations with IT as a A Cost Centre? Why is an emphasis on operability more important to IT performance than SRE?</p></strong></p></blockquote>



<h3>Introduction&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A successful Digital transformation is predicated on a transition from <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/it-as-a-cost-centre/">IT as a Cost Centre</a> to <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/it-as-a-business-differentiator/">IT as a Business Differentiator</a>. An IT cost centre creates segregated Delivery and Operations teams, trapped in an endless conflict between speed and reliability. Delivery wants to maximise deployments, to increase speed. Operations wants to minimise deployments, to increase reliability. This results in low performance IT, and has negative consequences for profitability, market share, and productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B9F83WM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Accelerate</em></a>, Dr Nicole Forsgren <em>et al</em> demonstrates speed and reliability are not a zero sum game. Investing in both Continuous Delivery and Operability will produce a high performance IT capability that can uncover new product revenue streams. For instance, transforming production support from <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-ops-runs-it/">You Build It Ops Run It</a> to <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-you-run-it/">You Build It You Run It</a> will unlock daily deployments, and have a positive impact on service reliability. User satisfaction, revenue protection, and brand reputation will all be improved.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>SRE as a Philosophy</h3>



<p>In 2004, Ben Treynor Sloss started an initiative called SRE within Google. He later described SRE as a software engineering approach to IT operations, with developers automating work historically owned outside Google by sysadmins. SRE key concepts include:</p>



<ul><li>Availability levels.</li><li>Service Level Objectives.</li><li>Error budgets.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/you-build-it-sre-run-it">You Build It SRE Run It</a>.</li></ul>



<p>Availability levels are known by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability" target="_blank">nines of availability</a>. 99.0% is two nines, 99.999% is five nines. 100% availability is unachievable, as less reliable user devices will limit the user experience. 100% is also undesirable, as maximising availability limits speed of feature delivery and increases operational costs. In the seminal book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/introduction/" target="_blank"><em>Site Reliability Engineering</em></a>, Betsey Byers <em>et al</em> observe that ‘an additional nine of reliability requires an order of magnitude more engineering effort’. At any availability level, an amount of unplanned downtime needs to be tolerated, in order to invest in feature delivery.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels.png 960w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-300x169.png 300w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-768x432.png 768w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-availability-levels-676x380.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a published target range of measurements, which sets user expectations on an aspect of service performance. A product manager chooses SLOs, based on their own risk tolerance. They have to balance the engineering cost of meeting an SLO with user needs, the revenue potential of the service, and competitor offerings. An availability SLO could be a median request success rate of 99.9% in 24 hours, with measurements collected every minute for 24 hours as a Service Level Indicator (SLI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>An error budget is a quarterly amount of tolerable, unplanned downtime for a service. It is used to mitigate any inter-team conflicts between product teams and SRE teams, as found in You Build It Ops Run It. It is calculated as 100% minus the chosen nines of availability. For example, an availability level of 99.9% equates to an error budget of 0.01% unsuccessful requests. 0.002% of failing requests in a week would consume 20% of the error budget, and leave 80% for the quarter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You Build It SRE Run It is a conditional production support method, where a team of SREs support a service for a product team. All product teams do You Build It You Run It by default, and there are strict entry and exit criteria for an SRE team. A service must have a critical level of user traffic, some elevated SLOs, and pass a readiness review. The SREs will take over on-call, and ensure SLOs are consistently met. The product team can launch new features if the service is within its error budget. If not, they cannot deploy until any errors are resolved. If the error budget is repeatedly blown, the SRE team can hand on-call back to the product team, who revert to You Build It You Run It.</p>



<p>This is <strong>SRE as a Philosophy</strong>. The biggest gift from SRE is a framework for quantifying availability targets and engineering effort, based on product revenue. SRE has also promoted ideas such as measuring partial availability, monitoring the golden signals of a service, building SLO alerts and SLI dashboards from the same telemetry data, and reducing operational toil where possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>SRE as a Cult</h3>



<p>In the 2010s, the DevOps philosophy of collaboration was bastardised by <a href="https://www.stevesmith.tech/blog/aim-for-operability-not-devops-as-a-cult/">DevOps as a Cult</a>. The DevOps cargo cult is ubiquitous, and wrong. Its beliefs are:</p>



<ol><li>The divide between Delivery and Operations teams is <em>always</em> the constraint in IT performance.&nbsp;</li><li>DevOps automation tools, DevOps engineers, DevOps teams, and/or DevOps certifications are <em>always</em> solutions to that problem.</li></ol>



<p>In a similar vein, the SRE philosophy has been corrupted by <strong>SRE as a Cult</strong>. The SRE cargo cult is based on the same flawed premise, and espouses SRE error budgets, SRE engineers, SRE teams, and SRE certifications as a panacea. Examples include Patrick Hill stating in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/devops/sre" target="_blank">Love DevOps? Wait until you meet SRE</a> that ‘SRE removes the conjecture and debate over what can be launched and when’, and the DevOps Institute offering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://devopsinstitute.com/certifications/sre-foundation/" target="_blank">SRE certification</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SRE as a Cult ignores the central question facing the SRE philosophy – its applicability to IT as a Cost Centre. SRE originated from talented, opinionated software engineers in a single, unique organisation. Google has IT as a Business Differentiator as a core tenet. Using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/13/suppl_2/ii22" target="_blank"><em>A Typology of Organisational Cultures</em></a> by Ron Westrum, its organisational culture can be described as generative. <em>Accelerate</em> found a generative culture is predictive of high performance IT, and less employee burnout.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum.png 960w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-300x169.png 300w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-768x432.png 768w, https://www.stevesmith.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aim-for-operability-not-sre-as-a-cult-westrum-676x380.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"></figure>



<p>There are fundamental challenges with applying SRE to an IT as a Cost Centre organisation with a bureaucratic or pathological culture. Product, Delivery, and Operations teams will be hindered by orthogonal incentives, funding pressures, and silo rivalries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Availability levels are a leading indicator of cross-organisation support for SRE. When failure leads to scapegoating or justice:</p>



<ul><li>Heads of Product/Delivery/Operations might not agree 100% reliability is unachievable.</li><li>Heads of Product/Delivery/Operations might not accept an additional nine of reliability means an order of magnitude more engineering effort.&nbsp;</li><li>Heads of Delivery/Operations might not consent to availability levels being owned by product managers.</li></ul>



<p>Service Level Objectives are based on the risk tolerances of product managers. When responsibilities are shirked or discouraged:</p>



<ul><li>Product managers might decline to take on responsibility for service availability.</li><li>Product managers will need help from Delivery teams to uncover user expectations, calculate service revenue potential, and check competitor availability levels.</li><li>Sysadmins might object to developers wiring automated, fine-grained measurements into their own production alerts.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Error budgets depend on shared agreements between different teams, without resorting to the inter-team battles of You Build It Ops Run It. When cooperation is modest or low:</p>



<ul><li>Product manager/developers/sysadmins might disagree on availability levels and the maths behind &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; error budgets.</li><li>Heads of Product/Development might not accept a block on deployments when an error budget is 0%.</li><li>A Head of Operations might not accept deployments at all hours when an error budget is above 0%.</li><li>Product managers/developers might accuse sysadmins of blocking deployments unnecessarily</li><li>Sysadmins might accuse product managers/developers of jeopardising reliability</li><li>A Head of Operations might arbitrarily block production deployments</li><li>A Head of Development might escalate a block on production deployments</li><li>A Head of Product might override a block on production deployments</li></ul>



<p>You Build It SRE Run It means a central developer team supporting services with high availability levels and critical user traffic, while other developer teams support their own services under You Build It You Run It. It is worlds apart from You Build It Ops Run It. When bridging is merely tolerated or discouraged:</p>



<ul><li>A Head of Operations might not consent to on-call Delivery teams on their opex budget</li><li>A Head of Development might not consent to on-call Delivery teams on their capex budget</li><li>A Head of Operations might be unable to afford months of software engineering training for their sysadmins on an opex budget</li><li>Sysadmins might not want to undergo training, or be rebadged as SREs</li><li>Developers might not want to do on-call for their services, or be rebadged as SREs</li><li>Delivery teams will find it hard to collaborate with an Operations SRE team on errors and incident management</li><li>A Head of Operations might be unable to transfer an unreliable service back to the original Delivery team, if it was disbanded when its capex funding ended&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In <em>Site Reliability Engineering</em>, Ben Treynor Sloss identifies SRE recruitment as a significant challenge for Google. Developers are needed that excel in both software engineering and systems administration, which is rare. He counters this with the argument that an SRE team is cheaper than an Operations team, as the headcount is reduced by task automation. Recruitment challenges will be exacerbated in IT as a Cost Centre organisations, due to much smaller recruitment budgets. The touted headcount benefit is absurd, as salary rates are invariably higher for developers than sysadmins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Aim for Operability, not SRE as a Cult</h3>



<p>Continuous Delivery requires operational excellence. Reliable production services will minimise operational rework, and increase the throughput of feature delivery. There are many pathways to Operability, and SRE is only one of those pathways. SRE as a Cult will promote the world …</p></div></div>

<p>There is an obvious reason to choose Julia:</p>
<blockquote><p>it's faster than other scripting languages, allowing you to have the rapid development of Python/MATLAB/R while producing code that is as fast as C/Fortran</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newcomers to Julia might be a little wary of that statement.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why not just make other scripting languages faster? If Julia can do it, why can't others? </li>
<li>How do you interpert Julia benchmarks to confirm this? (This is surprisingly difficult for many!)</li>
<li>That sounds like it violates the No-Free-Lunch heuristic. Is there really nothing lost?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people believe Julia is fast <strong>because it is Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled</strong> (i.e. every statement is run using compiled functions which are either compiled right before they are used, or cached compilations from before). This leads to questions about what Julia gives over JIT'd implementations of Python/R (and MATLAB by default uses a JIT). These JIT compilers have been optimized for far longer than Julia, so why should we be crazy and believe that somehow Julia quickly out-optimized all of them? However, that is a complete misunderstanding of Julia. What I want show, in a very visual way, is that Julia is fast because of its design decisions. The core design decision, <strong>type-stability through specialization via multiple-dispatch</strong> is what allows Julia to be very easy for a compiler to make into efficient code, but also allow the code to be very concise and "look like a scripting language". This will lead to some very clear performance gains.</p>
<p>But what we will see in this example is that Julia does not always act like other scripting languages. There are some "lunches lost" that we will have to understand. Understanding how this design decision effects the way you must code is crucial to producing efficient Julia code.</p>
<p>To see the difference, we only need to go as far as basic math.</p>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Arithmetic-in-Julia">Arithmetic in Julia<a href="#Arithmetic-in-Julia">¶</a></h2><p>In general, math in Julia looks the same as in other scripting languages. One detail to note is that the numbers are "true numbers", as in a <code>Float64</code> is truly the same thing as a 64-bit floating point number or a "double" in C. A <code>Vector{Float64}</code> is the same memory layout as an array of doubles in C, both making interop with C easy (indeed, in some sense "Julia is a layer on top of C") and it leads to high performance (the same is true for NumPy arrays).</p>

<p>Note here that I showed off Julia's unicode tab completion. Julia allows for unicode characters, and these can be used by tab completing Latex-like statements. Also, multiplication by a number is allowed without the * if followed by a variable. For example, the following is allowed Julia code:</p>

<h2 id="Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">Type-stability and Code Introspection<a href="#Type-stability-and-Code-Introspection">¶</a></h2><p>Type stability is the idea that there is only 1 possible type which can be outputtted from a method. For example, the reasonable type to output from <code>*(::Float64,::Float64)</code> is a <code>Float64</code>. No matter what you give it, it will spit out a <code>Float64</code>. This right here is multiple-dispatch: the <code>*</code> operator calls a different method depending on the types that it sees. When it sees floats, it will spit out floats. Julia provides code introspection macros so that way you can see what your code actually compiles to. Thus Julia is not just a scripting language, it's a scripting language which lets you deal with assembly! Julia, like many languages, compiles to LLVM (LLVM is a type of portable assembly language).</p>

<p>This output is saying that a floating point multiplication operation is performed and the answer is returned. We can even look at the assembly</p>

<p>This shows us that the <code>*</code> function has compiled down to exactly the same operation as what happens in C/Fortran, meaning it achieves the same performance (even though it's defined in Julia). Thus it is possible to not just get "close" to C, but actually get the same C code out. In what cases does this happen?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about Julia is that, asking which cases this happens is not the right question. the right question is, in what cases does the code not compile to something as efficient as C/Fortran? The key here is type-stability. If a function is type-stable, then the compiler can know what the type will be at all points in the function and smartly optimize it to the same assembly as C/Fortran. If it is not type-stable, Julia has to add expensive "boxing" to ensure types are found/known before operations.</p>
<h4 id="This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">This is the key difference between Julia and other scripting languages<a href="#This-is-the-key-difference-between-Julia-and-other-scripting-languages">¶</a></h4><p>The upside is that Julia's functions, when type stable, are essentially C/Fortran functions. Thus <code>^</code> (exponentiation) is fast. However, <code>^(::Int64,::Int64)</code> is type-stable, so what type should it output?</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>
<div>
<p>Here we get an error. In order to guarantee to the compiler that <code>^</code> will give an Int64 back, it has to throw an error. If you do this in MATLAB, Python, or R, it will not throw an error. That is because those languages do not have their entire language built around type stability.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>What happens when we don't have type stability? Let's inspect this code:</p>

<p>That's a very visual demonstration on why Julia achieves such higher performance than other scripting languages by how it uses type inference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Type stability is one crucial feature which separates Julia apart from other scripting languages.  In fact, the core idea of Julia is the following statement:</p>
<h4 id="Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">Multiple dispatch allows for a language to dispatch function calls onto type-stable functions.<a href="#Multiple-dispatch-allows-for-a-language-to-dispatch-function-calls-onto-type-stable-functions.">¶</a></h4><p>This is what Julia is all about, so let's take some time to dig into it.If you have type stability inside of a function (meaning, any function call within the function is also type-stable), then the compiler can know the types of the variables at every step. Therefore it can compile the function with the full amount of optimizations since at this point the code is essentially the same as C/Fortran code.  Multiple-dispatch works into this story because it means that <code>*</code> can be a type-stable function: it just means different things for different inputs. But if the compiler can know the types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> before calling <code>*</code>, then it knows which <code>*</code> method to use, and therefore it knows the output type of <code>c=a*b</code>. Thus it can propogate the type information all the way down, knowing all of the types along the way, allowing for full optimiziations. Multiple dispatch allows <code>*</code> to mean the "right thing" every time you use it, almost magically allowing this optimization.</p>
<p>There are a few things we learn from this. For one, in order to achieve this level of optimization, you must have type-stability. This is not featured in the standard libraries of most languages, and was choice that was made to make the experience a little easier for users. Secondly, multiple dispatch was required to be able to specialize the functions for types which allows for the scripting language syntax to be "more explicit than meets the eye". Lastly, a robust type system is required. In order to build the type-unstable exponentiation (which may be needed) we needed functionalities like convert. Thus the language must be designed to be type-stable with multiple dispatch and centered around a robust type system in order to achieve this raw performance while maintaining the syntax/ease-of-use of a scripting language. You can put a JIT on Python, but to really make it Julia, you would have to design it to be Julia.</p>

<h2 id="The-Julia-Benchmarks">The Julia Benchmarks<a href="#The-Julia-Benchmarks">¶</a></h2><p>The Julia benchmarks, featured on <a href="http://julialang.org/">the Julia website</a>, test components of the programming language for speed. <strong>This doesn't mean it's testing the fastest implemention</strong>. That is where a major misconception occurs. You'll have an R programmer look at the R code for the Fibonacci calculator and say "wow, that's terrible R code. You're not supposed to use recursion in R. Of course it's slow". However, the Fibonacci problem is designed to test recursion, not the fastest implementation to the the ith Fibonacci number. The other problems are the same way: testing basic components of the langauge to see how fast they are.</p>

<p>

Tagged in: <a href="https://try.popho.be/tag_vpn.html">vpn</a></p><p>I’ve had enough of paying for 1Gbps fiber connection and only using 100Mbps because of using my server at <a href="https://kimsufi.com/">Kimsufi</a> as my main gate to the internet.</p>
<p>The goal is now to use my VPN connection to protect my websurf only (no webmaster needs to get my home IP). The rest is more or less not-as-private, and will be using my ISP’s (high bandwidth) connection (games, GPG-signed updates). This usage differs from <a href="https://wireguard.com/netns/#the-new-namespace-solution">other examples that make seldom use of the <em>physical realm</em></a>: here we will use the physical connection by default, and “containing” specific applications.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://try.popho.be/images/vpn-netns-objective.svg" alt="Our objective, see the digraph’s source at sourcehut">
</figure>
<p>You should probably be up to speed with <a href="https://wireguard.com/">what WireGuard is</a> and how it works: see e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://try.popho.be/wg.html">a previous entry</a>.</p>

<p>Create an empty <code>netns</code> and populate it with <code>lo</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ip netns add vpn
ip -n vpn link set lo up</code></pre>
<p>The <code>wg1</code> interface’s “place of birth” is the physical realm. Thus, we first need to create <code>wg1</code> in the unnamed namespace before moving it to the <code>vpn</code> netspace. This is needed because <code>wg1</code> will send (encrypted) packets to the server through a real interface. If we create <code>wg1</code> in the <code>vpn</code> namespace, WireGuard won’t know how to reach the outside world (including the WireGuard server).</p>
<pre><code>ip link add wg1 type wireguard
ip link set wg1 netns vpn</code></pre>
<p>Then we use <code>wg(8)</code> and <code>ip(8)</code> to setup our VPN link</p>
<pre><code>ip netns exec vpn wg setconf wg1 /etc/wireguard/wg1.conf
ip -n vpn a add 10.X.Y.PPP/24 dev wg1
ip -n vpn a add aaaa::ffff/64 dev wg1
ip -n vpn link set wg1 up
ip -n vpn route add default dev wg1
ip -n vpn -6 route add default dev wg1</code></pre>
<p>Don’t forget to put a <code>resolv.conf(5)</code> file in <code>/etc/netns/vpn</code> as written in <code>ip-netns(8)</code>’ manpage. Now, testing time:</p>
<pre><code>for v in 4 6; do
 printf '%s' "default IPv$v: " ; curl -s$v https://icanhazip.com
 printf '%s' "VPN IPv$v:     " ; ip netns exec vpn curl -s$v https://icanhazip.com
done</code></pre>
<p>It is not yet possible to use <code>systemd.networkd(5)</code> to set everything up correctly, though there seems to be <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/14915">ongoing work on that front</a>; let’s hope it gets a bit more attention than <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/13673">my own bug report to systemd</a>.</p>

<pre><code>% ip netns exec vpn ping -c1 try.popho.be
setting the network namespace "vpn" failed: Operation not permitted</code></pre>
<p><code>ip netns</code> can’t run as user. I can’t be bothered to install and configure <code>sudo</code> properly, so we’ll rely on yet another piece of software instead: <a href="https://firejail.wordpress.com/"><code>firejail(1)</code></a></p>
<pre><code>% firejail --noprofile --netns=vpn firefox</code></pre>
<p><code>firejail</code> does its job, but this is a pain to type each time. Instead, we’ll wrap firefox in a short script.</p>
<p>We put <code>run-with-vpn</code> in one of the first items of <code>$PATH</code> (in <code>~/bin</code> for example):</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

# Aptly linking this script allows us to run any program in a network namespace
# Removing the first item of PATH revokes the precedence of our script, and we
# SHOULD end up using firejail on the REAL binary we target.
# We suppose that firejail does NOT reside next to our script, but further away
# in $PATH

if [ -e /var/run/netns/vpn ] ; then # Network NameSpace exists
  if command -v firejail &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 ; then
    PATH=${PATH#*:} firejail --noprofile --netns=vpn "$(basename $0)" "$@" &amp;
  fi
else
  notify-send "NO VPN" "$(basename $0) is running with NO VPN"
  PATH=${PATH#*:} "$(basename $0)" "$@" &amp;
fi</code></pre>
<p>Now, we create a symlink <code>firefox</code> to <code>run-with-vpn</code>:</p>
<pre><code>% cd ~/bin
% ln -s run-with-vpn firefox
% command -v firefox
/home/moviuro/bin/firefox
% sh -x "$(!!)"
+ '[' -e /var/run/netns/vpn ']'
+ command -v firejail
++ basename /home/moviuro/Documents/setup/bin/firefox
+ PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/home/moviuro/.local/share/flatpak/exports/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl
+ firejail --noprofile --netns=vpn firefox</code></pre>
<p>With this, we can simply launch <code>firefox</code> from our shell or <code>rofi</code>, and it’ll be run in our VPN NetNS.</p>

<p>The software that runs in a seperate NetNS can’t possibly leak your other addresses (so, that’s cool if you use any modern browser shipping <em>far too many</em> “features” such as: WebRTC…).</p>
<p>My desktop now has one IP that will only do websurf: TCP/80 and 443, UDP 443 and 53; I can filter even more what is allowed outbound in <code>pf</code>.</p>
<p>My machine is no longer blocked by my server’s <code>pf</code> if it tries to initiate connection to known-bad IP addresses (C&amp;C, SpamHaus’ <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/">DROP list</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>I achieved what I set out to do, however I’m a bit dissatisfied about having two VPN interfaces (<code>wg0</code> and <code>wg1</code>) connecting to the same VPN on the same machine, and the tooling is far from perfect:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wg0</code> is just a usual WireGuard interface, <em>without</em> <code>AllowedIPs=0.0.0.0/0</code>; this one allows me to reach some services such as my IRC bouncer or, as shown below, my <a href="https://try.popho.be/byeads.html">lying DNS server</a>;</li>
<li><code>wg1</code> is a WireGuard interface that we have to create by hand, half configure with <code>wg(8)</code>, half with <code>ip(8)</code>;</li>
<li><code>systemd</code> in its race to assimilate everything under the sun, still doesn’t support some features that I needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>On November 20, 2019, at FINOS' flagship conference, the <a href="https://opensourcestrategyforum.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Source Strategy Forum</a>, FINOS Platinum member <a href="https://developer.gs.com/docs/products/" rel="nofollow">Goldman Sachs</a> announced <a href="https://www.finos.org/press/goldman-announces-pure-alloy-contribution" rel="nofollow">its intention</a> to open source two closely related products into FINOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its internally developed logical modeling language, referred to within the bank as "PURE", and</li>
<li>A workbench of tools, including a visual modeling platform, collectively referred to as "Alloy", created and used within Goldman Sachs to build, design, and execute PURE models</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-pure">PURE language</a>, together with four modules - <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio">Studio</a>, <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc">SDLC</a>, <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-engine">Engine</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-shared">Shared</a> - were open sourced into FINOS on October 19, 2020. Concurrent to their open sourcing, they were collectively given a new, unified name - "Legend". The choice of the Legend name reflects how for Goldman Sachs the language and platform have been a guide - a legend - for the bank's data strategy.</p>

<p>A shared, external instance of Legend deployed on AWS within FINOS' infrastructure is available at <a href="https://legend.finos.org/studio" rel="nofollow">https://legend.finos.org/studio</a>. The primary purpose of this instance is to provide a shared modeling environment for the FINOS community and its projects. An additional purpose of this instance is to provide a place where people can try out Legend for themselves, check out its tools and features, and see what a Legend model looks like. This instance of Legend was the same instance that was used by the pilot group to model in Phase 1 (see <a href="#Roadmap">Roadmap</a> section below for more info on our phases).</p>
<p>To request an account on the shared instance, use the form at the bottom of <a href="https://www.finos.org/legend" rel="nofollow">https://www.finos.org/legend</a>. You will need a GitHub account and, if want to be able to create and edit models, be covered by a <a href="https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Contribution+Compliance+Requirements#ContributionComplianceRequirements-ContributorLicenseAgreement" rel="nofollow">Contributor License Agreement</a> with FINOS (otherwise a read-only account will be created).</p>
<p>Note that the features available in the shared, external Legend instance within FINOS infrastructure largely map to the five modules open sourced to date. Features that are not yet available include model-to-database mappings and the execution of queries as services. As more modules are open sourced, more features will be activated in the shared instance.</p>

<p>The Legend platform and project makes use of both GitHub and GitLab.</p>
<h3>GitHub</h3>
<ul>
<li>GitHub, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/finos/">FINOS GitHub organization</a>, is the distributed source and version control management system used for Legend code.
<ul>
<li>The Legend GitHub repos, like all FINOS repos, are configured to make use of the FINOS <a href="https://odp.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Developer Platform</a> tooling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GitHub infrastructure is what's used to do Legend builds (e.g., of <a href="https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.finos.legend" rel="nofollow">Legend JARS, which are then distributed through Maven Central</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>GitLab</h3>
<ul>
<li>GitLab is used for source control of models "under the hood" within the Legend SDLC module. As such the models, written in the Legend language, are stored in GitLab repositories.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repositores</h2>
<h3>Code Repositories (GitHub)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.github.com/finos/legend">This repository (finos/legend)</a> is the parent repository for the project. It is used principally for overall Legend documentation and issue tracking. The code itself for the 5 modules open sourced thusfar can be found in the following 5 child repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-shared">Shared Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-shared">https://github.com/finos/legend-shared</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc">SDLC Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc">https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio">Studio Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio">https://github.com/finos/legend-studio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-engine">Engine Module</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-engine">https://github.com/finos/legend-engine</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-pure">Legend Language</a>: <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-pure">https://github.com/finos/legend-pure</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Module Specific Issues</h4>
<p>Module specific issues are opened, maintained, and prioritized within the modules specific issue list (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues">https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues</a> for Legend Studio). Issues can be aggregated from multiple reposistories as needed through <a href="https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects">FINOS organization level GitHub kanban boards("Projects")</a>.</p>
<h3>Model Repositories (GitLab)</h3>
<p>Legend models developed on <a href="https://legend.finos.org/studio" rel="nofollow">the external shared instance</a>, including those built during the Phase 1 pilot described below, are themselves open sourced code and available in the following GitLab repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li>FX Options extensions to the CDM: <a href="https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/cdm" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/cdm</a></li>
<li>Commodities Reference Data: <a href="https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/commonrefdata" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/legend-pilot/commonrefdata</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note on model access in GitLab</strong> Currently to access (and fork, etc.) these GitLab model repositories directly, you will need an account on the Legend shared instance (an account is also required to model and access these models through the Studio UI). An account may be requested through the account request form at the bottom of <a href="https://www.finos.org/legend" rel="nofollow">https://www.finos.org/legend</a>. In the future we plan to <a href="https://github.com/finos/alloy/issues/177">migrate these model repositories</a> to public repos on GitLab.com, after which an account will no longer be needed to access and contain the repositories that contain the models.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to get involved with Legend and contribute to it, see the <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file or the <a href="https://legend.finos.org/docs/getting-started/contribute-to-legend" rel="nofollow">Contribute section of the docs site</a>.</p>

<p>(Coming Soon)</p>

<h2>Phase 0 (October 2019 - January 2020) - COMPLETED</h2>
<ul>
<li>Announced the intention to open source PURE/Alloy (now named Legend) at the <a href="https://opensourcestrategyforum.org/" rel="nofollow">Open Source Strategy Forum</a></li>
<li>Deployed an <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/legend.finos.org/studio">external instance of Legend</a> to AWS within FINOS infrastructure, initially for use in Phase 1 (see below) for pilot participants to use to do shared modeling.</li>
<li>Commenced internal code evaluation and preparation for open sourcing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 1 (January 2020 - September 2020) - COMPLETED</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Opened the <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/legend.finos.org/studio">external instance of Legend</a> Studio deployed in Phase 0 to a pilot group of financial institutions, composed of FINOS members plus several other institutions that expressed an interest in participating in the pilot, for them together with Goldman Sachs and FINOS to evaluate the use of Legend to do shared, collaborative modeling. In this release, Studio supported a limited set of functionality, including the creation of data models, model-to-model mappings, constraints and derivations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the pilot phase, modelers collaborated on the <a href="https://legend.finos.org/studio" rel="nofollow">Legend external instance</a> to build shared models. Modeling occurred in two work streams:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/tree/master/meeting-minutes/fx-options-wg">An FX workstream of the the pilot group</a> extended and expanded the FX Option model of the Common Domain Model (CDM), developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). The Averaging Model developed during the pilot has since been approved by the ISDA Architecture Review Committee and <a href="https://docs.rosetta-technology.io/cdm/releases/all.html" rel="nofollow">released in the CDM (see 2.82.8)</a>.</li>
<li>The pilot group also created a <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/tree/master/meeting-minutes/commodities-ref-data-wg">Commodity Reference Data workstream</a>, to work on commodities data, especially in the context of a Fixed vs Float swap, including defining a payout model to be proposed into the CDM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other areas that the pilot group have discussed as potential areas to model together in Legend include Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data as well as potentially continuing some of the work started by the <a href="https://fo.finos.org/docs/objects/rfq" rel="nofollow">FINOS Financial Objects program on RFQ</a> in the context of interest rate swaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performed code readiness work to extract Legend code from GS infrastructure, and sufficiently abstract and generalize code base as needed. Revised code base to reflect new name (note that some references to old "PURE" and "Alloy" name still exist). GS Engineering, together with FINOS and Linux Foundation DevOps teams, performed code scanning and remediations. Moved Goldman Sachs's daily production builds of Legend to FINOS infrastructure and public GitHub repos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 2 (October 2020 - December 2020)</h2>
<ul>
<li>On 2020.10.19 made underlying code bases to five Legend modules available as open source under an Apache 2.0 license</li>
<li>Announced new name (Legend) and rebranded</li>
<li>Identify "good first issues" for developers new to Legend</li>
<li>Begin accepting pull requests of code from external (non-GS) developers.</li>
<li>Conduct office hours for external developers interested in getting involved with Legend</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 3 (Q1 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make additional functionality available in Studio, including relational execution, support for flat data sources (e.g., csv) and automated code generation (e.g., JSON schema, Protobuf, AVRO).</li>
<li>Transition shared model repositories from hosted GitLab instance (gitlab.legend.finos.org) to gitlab.com.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 4 (Q3 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open source Cube UI for user-friendly tabular data exploration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 5 (Q4 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open source Query UI to search and access modeled data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phase 6 (Q4 2021)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open source Services UI. This will allow managing of production data services (APIs) for repeatable and controlled data access.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="https://legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">Legend Documentation Site (legend.finos.org)</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">documentation site</a> is built using Docusaurus based on the markdown files in the <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/docs"><code>docs</code></a> folder.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend">This Repository - GitHub.com (github.com/finos/legend)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/github.com/finos/legend">This repository (github.com/finos/legend)</a> hosts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The underling files for the <a href="https://legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">Legend Documentation site</a> (composed in markdown file format and stored in the <code>docs/</code> folder)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/issues">shared issues list</a> used for task management to track project activity around documentation, deployments, and the overall effort associated with open sourcing Legend</li>
<li>These issues are organized in various kanban boards, including the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/finos/projects/5">overall project kanban</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="https://gitlab.legend.finos.org/" rel="nofollow">FINOS Hosted GitLab Repository (gitlab.legend.finos.org)</a></h2>
<p>A separate <a href="https://github.com/finos/legend/blob/master/gitlab.legend.finos.org">hosted Gitlab repository, gitlab.legend.finos.org</a> hosts shared models that were developed by the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/finos.org/forum/#!forum/legend-pilot" rel="nofollow">Legend project pilot team</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation" rel="nofollow">gitlab.com (https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation)</a> [Not Yet Used]</h2>
<p>In the future we intend to migrate the models repositories from the hosted GitLab repository to <a href="https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation" rel="nofollow">https://gitlab.com/finosfoundation</a>. For now, this is unused but will eventually be the long-term home for public models built using Legend.</p>

This type of content is followed by demo/product tour pages and by pricing pages.</p><p>The next ones are the how-to posts and feature landing pages, which are targetting specific pain points. However, the industry articles — despite the good click-through rates, aren’t generating conversions yet.</p><p>How about the informational content types — guides, what is, strategy/thought leadership, best practices articles?</p><p>These aren’t performing well, so for this particular startup, it makes no sense to invest time into creating more top-of-the-funnel content, unless their only focus is getting more page views.</p><p>The top-of-the-funnel, informational content is, indeed, generating more views than the other types:</p><p><img alt="Sessions &amp; pages session per funnel" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/wqg266fbc5en/7i2dCLqPkOVO2YlooK9Cnl/45625e480ddc5194e13b085a067d5955/Sessions___pages_session_per_funnel.png"><img alt="Pages session and conversion rates per funnel" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/wqg266fbc5en/5zH4LJ3OWuUO8TnbK8UYAl/490622fc6c1cfba44ede5b73c0424b62/Pages_session_and_conversion_rates_per_funnel.png"></p><p>What’s interesting to see is that middle-of-the-funnel content, which is the best performing for this client, gets the most pages/session (average numbers in the graphics), as well as the best conversion rate.</p><p>So if this startup wants to increase their chances of converting more users, they could focus more on MOFU content.</p><p>Also, as a growth hacking experiment, they could optimize the bottom-of-the-funnel content to encourage users to visit more pages/session and see if this helps drive conversions up as well.</p><p>Of course, these numbers will vary depending on the amount of content produced, the niche, the type of SaaS, and whether it’s a B2B or B2C product.</p><p>Still, you can take these insights into consideration when planning your content calendar and deciding the types of content to invest more time in.</p><blockquote><p>If you own an early-stage SaaS startup and need some <a href="https://schoolofcontent.net/content-strategy/">guidance with your content strategy</a>, or you'd like to benefit from a similar <a href="https://schoolofcontent.net/content-audit/">content audit</a>, <a href="https://schoolofcontent.net/contact/">get in touch with our team</a>!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p>Social media are now one of the <strong>most used tools for customer service</strong>, but how can you use them professionally and effectively for your brand?</p>



<p>At first, there was the phone. It was the only way people could contact customer care to report a problem or ask for a piece of information.</p>



<p>Then, the Internet came, and emails became the most famous tool. Years later, social media sprang, and <strong>customer service started to act on social platforms</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you already use them for your customer service?</p>



<p>If yes, we hope those tips and tricks will help you make it even better.</p>



<p>If not, keep reading to become the king of social media customer service!</p>




<h2>
<span id="What_is_social_media_customer_service,_and_why_you_need_one"></span>What is social media customer service, and why you need one?<span></span>
</h2>



<p>Social media customer service <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/social-media-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">means</a> “using social channels to provide efficient and effective customer service and support. Customers expect to be able to reach out to brands on social channels for help—and get a quick reply.”</p>



<p>It sounds simple – all you need is a computer, your customers’ comments, and someone that answers them.</p>



<p>Social media customer service keywords should be <strong>“efficient support” and “quick reply”.</strong> They also are the most important and challenging elements to reach.</p>



<p>Reality is a bit more complicated than that. You have the chance to build a stable relationship with customers and provide them with real value.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7KBLRL8oQEVX_QldOYPtMT9PFsPJxJyYsaq0TAbHyVvMdarVk8g2ANSa24ZbQ3esYcJ2kFf8jR5RiBZY2ItkVmsclIrxW51pDj9_yCpzwbmI4FJhCyFt6XCwPMWSQrJIV3Emqp0c" width="602" height="452"></p>



<p>As you may be confused by the difference between <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/2019/06/12/a-better-buyer-persona-how-ai-can-improve-your-marketing-models/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">persona and person</a>, you may also ask: is there any difference between social customer service and customer care? The question is legit because often the two terms are confused.</p>



<p>They are pretty close, but they are more cousins than brothers. The main difference between them is proactivity.</p>



<p>Usually, customer service tends to be a <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-customer-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passive strategy</a>, while customer care – especially social media – is a proactive one.</p>



<p>Customer service enters the scene when people ask for it, usually after meeting the brand and purchasing their products.</p>



<p>The response is precise and quick, but customers have to ask it when they need it.</p>



<p>On the other hand, customer care is <strong>way more active on a daily basis to meet customers’ needs.</strong> For example, having self-service helps corners offer a personalized experience, and it even starts before the customer’s purchase.</p>



<p>Let’s discover the three main tips to have outstanding social media customer service.</p>



<h3>
<span id="Be_where_your_customers_are"></span><strong>Be where your customers are</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>First of all, today, people expect to have exceptional customer service, especially on social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>If it doesn’t happen, they move away.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Where does the interaction have to happen? <strong>Everywhere!</strong> Multi-touch customer services are pretty usual now, including significant social networks.</p>



<p>There is no phone anymore to contact a company – customers can reach their favorite brands on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. As Hootsuite points out, “64% of people would rather message than call a business” and “social media is the preferred customer support channel for those under 25, with 32.3% of them saying it’s their top choice”.</p>



<p>If you already haven’t, you better start looking for a social media manager or community manager!</p>

<span id="Develop_listening_customer%E2%80%99s_needs"></span><strong>Develop listening customer’s needs</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>When you decide to implement a social media customer service, the first question you need to ask is on which platforms you want to focus on. Even if you would like to be social on Earth to be sure, it would be impossible and useless.</p>



<p>It would be impossible because you wouldn’t probably have enough time and resources to do it.</p>



<p>It would be useless because your target is unlikely to be on every social media platform existent – you only have to<strong> pick the ones in which your audience is</strong>. Most of the time, you can find your target audience on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube.</p>



<p>Once you have chosen your platforms – with the help of <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/target-market-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">target analysis</a>, for example – it is time to<a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/2019/06/22/keep-your-ears-open-how-social-listening-helps-you-to-understand-your-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> start listening</a>.</p>



<p>If you have an online presence already – and if you haven’t, what are you waiting for? -l<strong>isten to what your audience says about you</strong>, managing their voice scattered along with the different places where they are</p>



<p>Once you have collected enough data, you can proceed with <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/2019/10/07/sentiment-analysis-the-success-for-brand-reputation-lies-in-language/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentiment analysis</a>.</p>



<p>Do they discuss your brand? Are the words flattering or not? Is there a flaw or a negative comment that appears more often than the others? Are there technical problems that your brand still hasn’t solved? How many feedbacks did you receive, and of which quality? Are there recurrent questions that you could solve with a FAQ section on your website?</p>



<p>You need to pull out all this data. If you are going to do it manually, you are going to have a hard life.</p>



<p>By using customer journey analytics systems like <a href="https://ghostwriter.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghostwriter AI </a>you can do it in the space of minutes.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ocZr3jinFDLWkTt0qHA0walxONTS-Gp3SYA8vCCTxMHaNoxYIXl3gBPz7_uWdVArJ5MsA7Rvzfj79ZsXPMMvgT9uaY0KAWPfICupfHnQ61nnP6zKU8C861d8jmLJt0TfIBhqEszj" width="602" height="299"></p>



<p>All of this will help you <strong>understand where you should focus</strong> your attention and time to make the user experience more exciting and appealing.</p>



<h3>
<span id="Create_a_bond"></span><strong>Create a bond&nbsp;</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>It is easy to understand: the more someone takes care of you, the more you tend to create a bond with them. With customers and customer service, it is the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the chance to <strong>create a bond and a relationship on social media </strong>with your customers based on muted trust.</p>



<p>If a customer has a problem with their favorite brand, a serious one, this already is quite tragic for the brand itself. The risk is to crack the faith the clients have in you.</p>



<p>Things get even worse when the brand is so self-centered that it merely disappears or sends pre-written emails without a spark of personalization or care.</p>



<p>And trust us – <strong>customers can feel it.</strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, if the brand shows that the customer is essential, if it shows care and attention, if it asks the problem and tries to solve it in the best way possible, you can be sure that people will remember this. If we remember the adverse events, what can be better than solving a problem for our customers and having their loyalty renewed?</p>



<h2>
<span id="Best_practices_for_a_social_media_customer_service_strategy"></span>Best practices for a social media customer service strategy<span></span>
</h2>



<p>Let’s see together <strong>five tips and tricks</strong>, or best practices, for you to make your social media customer service shine like a diamond!</p>



<h3>
<span id="Provide_the_right_service_on_each_channel"></span><strong>Provide the right service on each channel</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Not all social media platforms are the same, and this is true also when brands use them as part of their customer service strategy.</p>



<p>Even if customers use social media in a very sparse way, you need to <strong>know everyone’s rules </strong>before answering to comments and messages.</p>



<p>It does not mean just remembering that Twitter has a defined number of characters you can use. It has more to do on the kind of platform you are using and the different tones of voices you can choose between.</p>



<p>Naturally, the rule you need to remember is that <strong>no social network allows you to lose your professionalism</strong>. Always behave like the professional worker you are, without trying, i.e., to make people laugh.</p>



<p>That said, on Facebook, you can send a link in the comment and create contact with the clients’ needs.</p>



<p>You can use some specific keywords on Twitter to expand your audience and solve more than one person’s problems.</p>



<h3>
<span id="Create_a_set_of_guidelines"></span><strong>Create a set of guidelines</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Even games have rules to follow, so it is natural that a brand that deals with customers has them, too.</p>



<p>They are essential for many reasons.</p>



<p>First, they give you <strong>a trace to follow in every circumstance</strong>: an angry customer, a troll, a specific request, a flame that ignited under a controversial post.</p>



<p>Moreover, it defines the brand and makes it recognizable in every aspect, platform, and moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, one thing you may decide is the tone of voice. In which way am I going to answer the questions of my audience? A classic and professional one, an ironic one, a serious one?</p>



<h3>
<span id="Be_proactive_in_providing_a_better_service"></span><strong>Be proactive in providing a better service.</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Do not only wait for customers to ask you something – <strong>be proactive and anticipate them!</strong></p>



<p>Do they often ask you specific questions? Use it at your advantage!</p>



<p>You can create an FAQ. lists, educational pieces content, freebies to make people know your product better.</p>



<p>Use your customers’ doubts to create useful resources and better service!</p>



<h3>
<span id="Answer_every_single_question_%E2%80%93_and_as_quickly_as_you_can!"></span><strong>Answer every single question – and as quickly as you can!</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>The first rule of customer service is to answer every single question fast and with high accuracy. <strong>Time-response rate counts!&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Do not forget any questions, even if they are repetitive. They look insignificant because customers will remember it, and other people will see it, for instance, on your public Facebook page.</p>



<p>Always be friendly to the customers and, if you promised to send more information, don’t forget to do it.</p>



<p>Ah, and always remember, <strong>be quick – have we already said that?</strong></p>



<h3>
<span id="Take_care_of_your_customers%E2%80%99_privacy_know_when_to_answer_in_public_and_when_not"></span><strong>Take care of your customers’ privacy: know when to answer in public and when not.</strong><span></span>
</h3>



<p>Not all the questions are the same.</p>



<p>There may be a frequent question made by an aggressive person, a very technical one, or something too personal – you’ll never know.</p>



<p>If the questions are generic, you can quickly answer them in public, adding links and whatever it takes to make the customer experience more comfortable.</p>



<p>However, if there are more delicate questions, complaints, or aggressive talking, the best thing you can do is <strong>answer in privat</strong>e. Not everything has to be public, and, sometimes, you can better handle a problem with a client when there are only the two of you involved.</p>



<p>Have you ever used these tricks? How did it go?</p>



<h2>
<span id="Conclusions"></span>Conclusions<span></span>
</h2>



<p>Social media platforms are one of the most known places where people can connect with brands.</p>



<p>Thanks to social media, you can <strong>analyze your customers</strong>, what they are discussing, and what they think about your brand.</p>



<p>In this way, you can provide better service by knowing what they need and desire.</p>



<p>Always remember to <strong>be polite and adapt the communication</strong> to the right channel!</p>

<p>One of the reasons I started writing is to learn more. The Feynman technique was an inspiration for this.</p>



<h2><strong>The Feynman Technique</strong></h2>



<p>Richard Feynman was a theoretical Physicist. He won a Nobel prize for his contributions to quantum thermodynamics. In other words, he was a genius.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a few minutes, listen to the genius here.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36GT2zI8lVA?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Feynman always made sure he had a deeper understanding of concepts, before teaching it to anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>There are four steps in the Feynman technique</strong></p>



<ol><li>Pick a topic</li><li>Understand the basics. Write what you understood as if you are teaching a 6th-grade student. Use simple language.</li><li>Look at your notes. Identify what you do not know yet. For example, if you are using jargon, you probably did not understand something. Go back to your source of learning and improve your understanding.</li><li>Review and repeat.</li></ol>



<p>We tend to hide complexities under jargon. In a business meeting or a job interview, a lot of jargon is often a red flag.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The ultimate test of your knowledge is when you can convey it to someone else.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Why write?</strong></h2>



<p>Writing is step two and three of the Feynman technique. This is where I try to convey what I understood to others. I make sure to write about the new topics I learn.</p>



<p>But there are more reasons for this.</p>



<ol><li>You share what you learn. It might help others. Even if it only helps one person, it is a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/positive-sum-game">positive-sum game</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>You will have a deeper understanding of what you learned.&nbsp;</li><li>It improves your language proficiency</li><li>It adds to your resume</li></ol>



<p>The last two reasons are a byproduct of continuous writing. It can be immensely helpful in building a great career. In a world that is more global than ever, communication skills and command over English can be the difference between the good and the great.</p>



<p>I have had people reach out to me after reading my blog post. Thanking, appreciating, and criticizing what I write. It makes my day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Learn slowly</strong></p>



<p>I’m a fan of slow learning. When I learn a concept, I try to understand it and apply it in my life the same day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently I read about second-order thinking and the inverse mental model. I spent a few days with it. I tried applying those in my daily life and work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More on that, in a different blog post.</p>



<p>The point is when you write, you learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>That’s it. There is nothing fancy here. It is a simple technique you can apply in your life to learn more things quicker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bonus, share what you learn. Be the light the world needs.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      I didn't want to be the guy write this post, but I am because Chris told
      me to so blame that fuckin guy. I'm a victim here.
    </p>

    <p>
      But you're all using <code>const</code> in JavaScript too much and it
      does bug me just ever so little.
    </p>

    <h3>1. <code>const</code> doesn't do shit and we all know it</h3>

    <p>
      For starters, let's agree that <code>const</code> is fucking useless and
      we're inventing meaning...
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE = { right: "?" };
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.right = <em>"wrong"</em>;
THIS_SHOULDNT_CHANGE.<em>fucking</em> = <em>"deal with it"</em>;</code></pre>

    <p>
      <code>const</code> does not imply any kind of immutability of the value
      itself, it only implies immutability of the <em>binding</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Which... Cool.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The linters can't save you now</h3>

    <p>
      Let's also eliminate the idea that we could somehow statically enforce
      that <em>const</em> values are immutable with a linter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like, sure, you could for the simple case:
    </p>

    <pre><code>const FOO = { prop: true };
FOO.prop = false; <em>// LINT ERR &gt;XD</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      But then like... side effects exist and shit will hurt you
    </p>

    <pre><code>export function mutatesProp(obj) {
  obj.prop = false;
}</code></pre>

    <pre><code>import { mutatesProp } from './mutatesProp';
const FOO = { prop: true };
mutatesProp(FOO); <em>// no lint err :(</em></code></pre>

    <p>
      And yeah, type systems like Flow and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=have%20you%20tried%20typescript&amp;src=typd">HiHaveYouTriedTypeScriptYouShouldReallyTryTypeScriptIWriteTypeScriptAndImFuckingObnoxiousImGonnaStickMyHeadInAMicrowaveAndScreamTypeScript™</a> could do
      <em>something</em> with this, but like... they don't... sooooo
    </p>

    <h3>3. No it's not useful for compilers</h3>

    <p>
      You might be thinking, "Oh but it can still be used to optimize code or
      whatever"
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be right in thinking that compiler optimizations would make it
      interesting enough to use. But...
    </p>

    <p>
      You would be wrong in thinking that <code>const</code> is at all useful
      to optimizing compilers.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's already really really easy to identify a binding and figure out if
      it's never reassigned. All of the relevant optimizations are already
      possible without <code>const</code> ever being a thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, V8 and friends have been doing these optimizations without
      <code>const</code> for a really long time. Benedikt or Franziska or
      whoever can correct me if I'm wrong, but Babel definitely can already do
      this shit.
    </p>

    <h3>4. So what are we going to do?</h3>

    <p>
      First off, like... we don't <em>have</em> to <em>do</em> anything. There is no
      reason you would ever <em>have</em> to use <code>const</code>, and
      whereever we are using it, we could just as easily use <code>let</code>
      and our code wouldn't be impacted in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Honestly, if you just want to stop here and never use <code>const</code>
      again and never question it further, you will save literally whole...
      minutes of your life.
    </p>

    <p>
      But like... we <em>have</em> <code>const</code> so why don't we use it for
      <em>something</em> ...right? We could like use it to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>5. But what we've chosen to communicate is annoying as fuck</h3>

    <p>
      So, lots of people (okay maybe not you, you special little shit) are
      doing this... <em>thing</em> where they change every <code>let</code>
      variable which is never re-assigned to <code>const</code>.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      They would see the above code and say "that <code>let</code> should be a
      <code>const</code> so that the reader knows at the declaration of
      <code>answer</code> that it never changes."
    </p>

    <p>
      And many of them will include linter tools for enforcing that rule on
      every variable declaration, even sometimes applying the "fix"
      automatically.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>const</em> answer = 42;
neverChangeTheAnswer(answer);
justKeepDoingOtherStuffWithTheValue(answer);</code></pre>

    <p>
      "That's better."
    </p>

    <p>
      But... is it better?
    </p>

    <p>
      Did you <em>really</em> mean to <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> that
      we should never change the <code>answer</code> or do we just
      <em>happen</em> to never change it?
    </p>

    <p>
      What if we came along later and decided we are okay changing the answer?
      But now it's a <code>const</code> and we aren't really sure if we're
      going to break someone's expectation for <code>answer</code> if we do
      change it.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are lots of bindings that we <em>happen</em> to never change that
      we're totally fine if they do change. In fact, that's probably true for
      <em>most</em> bindings. It's not something your code will generally care
      about.
    </p>

    <p>
      But by automatically applying this rule to every binding no matter what
      the author's actual intent was, we actually throw out our opportunity to
      <strong><em>communicate</em></strong> something.
    </p>

    <h3>6. So what should we actually use <code>const</code> for?</h3>

    <p>
      It's probably still a good idea to communicate that you really
      <em>don't</em> intend for something to be changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      But in order to communicate that, we need to only use it when
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <pre><code>const I_ACTUALLY_GIVE_A_SHIT_IF_THIS_CHANGES = 42;</code></pre>

    <p>
      If you want some good rules to follow, here's my best attempt:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Only use <code>const</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <pre><code>const <em>HERE</em> = "is okay";

function nested() {
  const <em>NOT_HERE</em> = "never seen a reason to";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      I'm pretty sure I've never seen a binding created in a function that will
      actually be upset if it changes. I never use <code>const</code> inside
      nested scopes, and I don't intend to. Why? Because my mom raised me
      right (see my usage of semicolons), that's why.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Avoid using <code>let</code> at the top level scope</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, if you need to use <code>let</code> at the top-level
      scope, that's a sign you have some sort of global singleton state which
      could cause you problems.
    </p>

    <pre><code><em>let globalState</em> = "hmmm...";

function fn() {
  <em>globalState =</em> "this seems fragile to test...";
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      And like... that's basically it...
    </p>

    <p>
      And for the love of all that is not shit, please don't try enforcing this
      with a linter. Let people communicate what they want to communicate.
      Ya'll drive me crazy with that shit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now get the fuck out of my house.
    </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div id="post-body"><p>Earlier this week, I was doing some work on AWS and wanted to know what IP addresses were being used. Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante!

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

		<p><em>(*) in software development</em><br><em>(**) during almost 20 years of professional journey</em></p><hr><p>Career development ain't easy. There's no single path - equally right for everyone. It's highly contextual, dependent on individual strengths, advantages ... and aspirations. And of course, there's the luck factor - you can amplify an opportunity once you face it but only if you face any ...</p><p>Nevertheless, I believe that some universal learnings could be applied by literally everyone. I've assembled my personal (highly subjective) list ... only to find out that it has quickly got out of control, growing to 10, 15, 20, and even more items. It was hard to question any of them, but I intend to keep a crispy, crystal-clear message - hence the decision to reduce the list to ONLY SIX most important advice.</p><p>First of all:</p><blockquote>1. No-one will manage your career for you; this responsibility is yours and yours only!</blockquote><p>That sounds more than obvious, yet 90% of people ignore that. For some reason, they naively hope their current employer will take care of their future - identify the most promising career direction, push them to develop necessary skills, make sure the work performed spurs the individual growth, etc. That MAY be the case if you're lucky enough to encounter a pristine leader who prioritizes people over KPIs, but ... it occurs very rarely.</p><blockquote>2. There's no (personal) development w/o challenges and goals - everyone needs some stretching and pressure.</blockquote><p>I agree that <strong>it's not the target but the journey</strong> that truly elevates us to the higher levels. But that journey has to have a meaning - we need a direction, an azimuth, and a goal within reach — a goal that is both worthwhile and achievable (according to our own judgment). Pushing tasks through (like a conveyor belt) w/o a broader context and fulfilling milestones quickly gets tedious, repetitive, and ... demotivating.</p><blockquote>3. Successful people "attract" the interesting work - the best way to boost your career is to prove to be effective &amp; reliable (adjust your level to current capabilities, it's OK to start small); stick to successful people first and become one (in time) as well.</blockquote><p>What matters, in the end, is not how well you know Azure or Node.js (sheer skills make you an efficient, expensive TOOL), but whether you're effective (<strong>you get the stuff done</strong>) or not. Engineers who focus on achieving "technical successes" (but rarely add any meaningful business value) tend to be very happy with themselves, though once they disappear from the team - its causative power (counterintuitively) increases. Once you get recognized as effective, you'll act like a magnet to the most attractive opportunities, the best people, and the most exciting technical challenges.</p><p>Get involved, take ownership, lead the way and don't be afraid to take (controlled) risks!</p><blockquote>4. We're all defined by the sum of our unique experiences. Nothing compares (in terms of learning speed &amp; intensity) to the actual battle scars we've acquired in the wild while learning craft the hard way.</blockquote><p>To get more experience (/skills /proficiencies), you need to face new experiences (/situations /challenges /endeavors) - if your work environment is static (conditions don't change) and you've stopped "learning by doing" - you're stuck and wasting time. Employers do realize that and try to "bribe" you with "horizontal promotions", privileges or extrinsic (material) motivators - such a <strong>"golden cage"</strong> is one of the most dangerous career traps. Do you know the difference between "10 years of XP" and "10 x 1 year of XP"? That's exactly the point.</p><blockquote>5. The proper career development model is 'E-shaped person': a versatile generalist with few, diversified areas of specialized expertise.</blockquote><p>Strong engineering foundations, based upon professional curiosity and traditional mental models (we all stand upon the shoulders of giants) are very important, but to make a difference, one should bring some unique flavor (attractive specialty) to the table. However, the tech develops so quickly and in such an unpredictable manner that betting on a single horse is simply too risky. That's why I suggest hedging your specialty: always have a plan B (pro-actively, not re-actively).</p><p>Treat it as the most important investment, <strong>the investment in yourself</strong>. If well made, it can upgrade your career from slow, linear growth to the accelerated, exponential one. </p><blockquote>6. Being a successful software engineer is far less about coding than it seems.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>I have been using <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> intensively for more than 4years,
mainly on the servers I administrate. It’s a really powerful &amp; stable (one of the most) OS, with a <em>TONS</em> of package available
trough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)">APT</a>.</p>
<p>Debian has helped me in a lot of ways, and I wanted to bring something in return, even the little help I could offer.
So, one year ago I have emailed a friend who is also a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper">DD</a>, to ask him if he’s
willing to become my mentor to help me contribute to Debian. One year ago,
I’ve started, with his help, the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/">new maintainer process</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that this isn’t a technical guide at ALL, it’s more my opinions &amp; impressions on the Debian maintainer
experience.</p>

<p>You can contribute to Debian in a lot of ways: from translating, submitting bug reports / patches (bugfixes),
help newcomers on forums, help package &amp; maintain software, etc (<a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/help">full list of wanted contributions</a>). It only depends on
your skills, your free time &amp; what you like to do.</p>
<p>I personally wanted to get involved into packaging (TL;DR: help get software into the Debian archive,
so that end-users can install them with apt).</p>

<h2 id="21-learn-how-to-make-a-package-from-scratch">2.1. Learn how to make a package from scratch<a href="#21-learn-how-to-make-a-package-from-scratch" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The first step is to learn how to make a package from scratch, so that you can understand exactly how it works,
and therefore be able to investigate future errors. I have used the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Packaging/Intro?action=show&amp;redirect=IntroDebianPackaging">following documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I personally have spent 2 weeks reading the documentation, setting up a VM, and trial by errors. I have learned a lot of
things that would help me a lot in the future.</p>
<p>For me, learning to make a package from scratch is a <em>really</em> important step, since it will be the core of your work
as a maintainer. Nowadays, a lot of the package process is automated, especially with the <em>dh-make</em> tools. Therefore,
a lot of stuff is going on under the hood, and not knowing how packaging work will make you struggle when encountering
errors / fixing packaging related bugs.</p>
<h2 id="22-learn-what-to-package">2.2. Learn what to package<a href="#22-learn-what-to-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Once you know how to package stuff, you have to choose what you’re gonna do with this new skill.
Once again, several options are available:</p>
<h3 id="221-create-a-new-package">2.2.1. Create a new package<a href="#221-create-a-new-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>This option may be the most interesting, especially if you already have a
software in mind, but you’re gonna ask you a some questions first:</p>
<ul>
<li>does this package will fit in the archive? (copyright, usefulness, etc…)</li>
<li>Do I have enough skills to package this software?</li>
<li>Do I have enough free time?</li>
<li>Doesn’t this package already exist?</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of doubt, always ask somewhere for help. You can use <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/IRC">IRC</a>, <a href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/">mailing list</a>, etc.</p>
<h3 id="222-help-maintain-existing-package">2.2.2. Help maintain existing package<a href="#222-help-maintain-existing-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>There’s a lot of package in <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfh">RFH</a> (request for help). These packages already have
a maintainer, but seeking for help, meaning that he may be willing to help you update / fix bugs on the package, as
well as upload it on the archive for you.</p>
<p>RFH packages are really great since you’ll help an existing maintainer, learn from him, be able to ask questions,
and the maintainer may be willing to advocate you to become a Debian maintainer in the future (see below for more details).</p>
<h3 id="223-take-over-abandoned-package">2.2.3. Take over abandoned package<a href="#223-take-over-abandoned-package" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Sometimes, maintainer may not have enough time for their packages, and will mark a package <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/rfa">RFA</a> (request for adoption).
These package are basically abandoned, looking for adoption. The maintainer may help you in taking over the maintenance.</p>

<p>When your package is finished (successfully built + tested) you can’t just upload it on the Debian archive. Only DD &amp; <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">DM</a>
can do that.</p>
<p>You’ll have to ask someone with upload rights to review it &amp; upload it for you (this is called sponsoring).</p>
<p>To ease package reviewing you can use <a href="https://mentors.debian.net/">mentors</a> and/or email the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/">debian-mentors</a> mailing list.</p>
<p>Once your first package is on <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable">unstable</a>, you will be a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SponsoredMaintainer">Sponsored maintainer</a>!</p>

<p>Once you start mastering the art of packaging, you may candidate to become a Debian Maintainer (DM).</p>
<p>DM are people with a restricted upload rights on the archive. DD can grant them upload rights for specific packages,
so that they will be able to upload without sponsoring.</p>
<p>To become a DM you must go through the <a href="https://nm.debian.org/">new-member process</a>, there’s several steps required such
as getting your PGP uid signed by a DD (to enable trust), being advocated by a DD, agreeing to the <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">SC</a>/<a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>/<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/dmup">DMUP</a>.</p>
<p>After completing all steps, your application will stay pending for 4days+ (to allow any objections to be made)
and finally the keyring maintainers will add your key to the Debian keyring, making you a Debian maintainer.</p>

<p>Contributing to such a big &amp; distributed open source project taught me a lot of things, from technical skills such as packaging,
reviewing / submitting patches, arguing about them, reporting bugs, …
To social skills such as asynchronous communication (only email &amp; IRC based) all
around the world, working with a lot of different mindset, culture, <strong>being patient</strong>, humble, etc…</p>
<p>This experience helped me to be a better software developer &amp; human being.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank the whole Debian community who is always really helpful &amp; especially Alexandre Viau, my mentor,
who has greatly helped me &amp; pushed me to become a Debian maintainer.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

<![CDATA[What ORMs Have Taught Me: Just Learn SQL (2014)]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[

October 20, 2020 | https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/1/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p>
I’ve come to the conclusion that, for me, ORMs are more detriment than
benefit. In short, they can be used to nicely augment working with SQL
in a program, but they should not replace it.
</p>

<p>
Some background: For the past 30 months I’ve been working with code
that has to interface with Postgres and to some extent, SQLite. Most
of that has been with <a href="http://sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> (which I quite like) and <a href="http://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a>
(which I don’t). I’ve worked with existing code and data models, as
well as designing my own. Most of the data is event-based storage
(“timelines”) with a heavy emphasis on creating reports.
</p>

<p>
Much has been written about the Object/Relational Impedance
Mismatch. It’s hard to appreciate it until you live it. Neward, in his
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">well known essay</a>, lays out many cogent reasons why ORMs turn into
quagmires. In my experience, I’ve had to deal directly with a fair
number of them: <i>entity identity issues</i>, <i>dual-schema problem</i>, <i>data
retrieval mechanism concern</i>, and the <i>partial-object problem</i>. I want to
talk briefly about my experiences with these issues and add one of my
own.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge4f50a6">
<h2 id="orge4f50a6">Partial objects, attribute creep, and foreign keys</h2>
<div id="text-orge4f50a6">
<p>
Perhaps the most subversive issue I’ve had with ORMs is “attribute
creep” or “wide tables”, that is, tables that just keep accruing
attributes. As much as I’d like to avoid it, sometimes it becomes
necessary (although things like <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/interactive/hstore.html">Postgres’ hstore</a> can help). For
example, a client may be providing you with lots of data that they
want attached to reports based on various business logic. Furthermore,
you don’t have much insight into this data; you’re just schlepping it
around.
</p>

<p>
This in and of itself isn’t a terrible thing in a database. It becomes
a real pain point with an ORM. Specifically, the problem starts to
show up in any query that uses the entity directly to create the
query. You may have a Hibernate query like so early on in the project.
</p>

<pre>query(Foo.class).add(Restriction.eq("x", value))
</pre>

<p>
This may be fine when Foo has five attributes, but becomes a data fire
hose when it has a hundred. This is the equivalent of using <code>SELECT
*</code>, which is usually saying more than what is intended. ORMs, however,
encourage this use and often make writing precise projections as
tedious as they are in SQL. (I have optimized such queries by adding
the appropriate projection and reduced the run time from minutes to
seconds; all the time was spent translating the database row into a
Java object.)
</p>

<p>
Which leads to another bad experience: the pernicious use of foreign
keys. In the ORMs I’ve used, links between classes are represented in
the data model as foreign keys which, if not configured carefully,
result in a large number of joins when retrieving the object. (A
recent count of one such table in my work resulted in over 600
attributes and 14 joins to access a single object, using the preferred
query methodology.)
</p>

<p>
Attribute creep and excessive use of foreign keys shows me is that in
order to use ORMs effectively, you still need to know SQL. My
contention with ORMs is that, if you need to know SQL, just use SQL
since it prevents the need to know how non-SQL gets translated to SQL.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d7e33d">
<h2 id="org2d7e33d">Data retrieval</h2>
<div id="text-org2d7e33d">
<p>
Knowing how to write SQL becomes even more important when you attempt
to actually write queries using an ORM. This is especially important
when efficiency is a concern.
</p>

<p>
From what I’ve seen, unless you have a really simple data model (that
is, you never do joins), you will be bending over backwards to figure
out how to get an ORM to generate SQL that runs efficiently. Most of
the time, it’s more obfuscated than actual SQL.
</p>

<p>
And if you elect to keep the query simple, you end up doing a lot of
work in the code that could be done in the database faster. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function_%28SQL%29#Window_function">Window
functions</a> are relatively advanced SQL that is painful to write with
ORMs. Not writing them into the query likely means you will be
transferring a lot of extra data from the database to your
application.
</p>

<p>
In these cases, I’ve elected to write queries using a templating
system and describe the tables using the ORM. I get the convenience of
an application level description of the table with direct use of
SQL. It’s a lot less trouble than anything else I’ve used so far.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org05d550b">
<h2 id="org05d550b">Dual schema dangers</h2>
<div id="text-org05d550b">
<p>
This one seems to be one of those unavoidable redundancies.  If you
try to get rid of it, you only make more problems or add excessive
complexity.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that you end up having a data definition in two places:
the database and your application.  If you keep the definition
entirely in the application, you end up having to write the SQL Data
Definition Language (DDL) with the ORM code, which is the same
complication as writing advanced queries in the ORM.  If you keep it
in the database, you will probably want a representation in the
application for convenience and to prevent too much “string typing”.
</p>

<p>
I much prefer to keep the data definition in the database and read it
into the application.  It doesn’t solve the problem, but it makes it
more manageable.  I’ve found that reflection techniques to get the
data definition are not worth it and I succumb to managing the
redundancy of data definitons in two places.
</p>

<p>
But the damn migration issue is a real kick in the teeth: changing the
model is no big deal in the application, but a real pain in the
database.  After all, databases are persistent whereas application
data is not.  ORMs simply get in the way here because they don’t help
manage data migration at all.  I work on the principle that the
database’s data definitions aren’t things you should manipulate in the
application.  Instead, manipulate the results of queries.  That is,
the queries are your API to the database.  So instead of thinking
about objects, I think about functions with return types.
</p>

<p>
Thus, one is forced to ask, should you use an ORM for anything but
convenience in making queries?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7033826">
<h2 id="org7033826">Identities</h2>
<div id="text-org7033826">
<p>
Dealing with entity identities is one of those things that you have to
keep in mind at all times when working with ORMs, forcing you to write
for two systems while only have the expressivity of one.
</p>

<p>
When you have foreign keys, you refer to related identities with an
identifier. In your application, “identifier” takes on various
meanings, but usually it’s the memory location (a pointer). In the
database, it’s the state of the object itself. These two things don’t
really get along because you can really only use database identifiers
in the database (the ultimate destination of the data you’re working
with).
</p>

<p>
What this results in is having to manipulate the ORM to get a database
identifier by manually flushing the cache or doing a partial commit to
get the actual database identifier.
</p>

<p>
I can’t even call this a leaky abstraction because the work “leak”
implies small amounts of the contents escaping relative to the source.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgddbdda4">
<h2 id="orgddbdda4">Transactions</h2>
<div id="text-orgddbdda4">
<p>
Something that Neward alludes to is the need for developers to handle
transactions. Transactions are dynamically scoped, which is a powerful
but mostly neglected concept in programming languages due to the
confusion they cause if overused.  This leads to a lot of boilerplate
code with exception handlers and a careful consideration of where
transaction boundaries should occur.  It also makes you pass session
objects around to any function/method that might have to communicate
with the database.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a transaction translates poorly to applications due to
their reliance on context based on time. As mentioned, dynamic scoping
is one way to use this in a program, but it is at odds with lexical
scoping, the dominant paradigm. Thus, you must take great care to know
about the “when” of a transaction when writing code that works with
databases and can make modularity tricky (“Here’s a useful function
that will only work in certain contexts”).
</p>

<p>
Where do I see myself going?
</p>

<p>
At this point, I’m starting to question the wisdom behind the outright
rejection of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProcedures">stored procedures</a>.  It sounds <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StoredProceduresAreEvil">heretical</a>, but it may work
for my use cases.  (And hey, with the advent of “devops”, the divide
between the developer and the database administrator is basically
non-existent.)
</p>

<p>
I’ve found myself thinking about the database as just another data
type that has an API: the queries.  The queries return values of some
type, which are represented as some object in the program. By moving
away from thinking of the objects in my application as something to be
stored in a database (the raison d’être for ORMs) and instead thinking
of the database as a (large and complex) data type, I’ve found working
with a database from an application to be much simpler. And wondering
why I didn’t see it earlier.
</p>

<p>
(It should be made clear that I am not claiming this is how all
applications should deal with a database.  All I am saying is that
this fits my use case based on the data I am working with.)
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether I find that stored procedures aren’t actually
that evil or whether I keep using templated SQL, I do know one thing:
I won’t fall into the “ORMs make it easy” trap. They are an acceptable
way to represent a data definition, but a poor way to write queries
and a bad way to store object state. If you’re using an RDBMS, bite
the bullet and learn SQL.

We gave the entire backstory in our piece <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/freenas-is-dead-long-live-truenas-core/">FreeNAS is Dead Long Live TrueNAS CORE</a>. With the TrueNAS Core 12.0 release, that brand swap is now done and iXsystems now have a unified platform for both its “free” and enterprise offerings.<span id="more-47847"></span></p>
<h2>TrueNAS 12 Release Key Features</h2>
<p>Many of STH’s readers are going to wait a few weeks to upgrade given the company’s history with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/freenas-corral-canned-development-essentially-halted-now/">releases</a>. At the same time, the release is very easy to do for a current system. Under System -&gt; Update, you will see a Train dropdown. You want to select the TrueNAS-12.0-STABLE release train. Then Download Updates.</p>

<p>On our first test system we updated this took a few clicks and a few minutes until we were running TrueNAS core.</p>
<p>For the high-level updates on the new release, here are the key new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ZFS Native Crypto</b>&nbsp;– Per-dataset encryption and support for encrypted replication to untrusted targets.</li>
<li><b>2 Factor Authentication</b>&nbsp;– Allows using Applications such as “Google Authenticator” to provide an extra level of security before logging into the UI or SSH access.</li>
<li><b>KMIP Support</b>&nbsp;– TrueNAS Enterprise now adds the ability to interface with KMIP servers for the storage and retrieval of passwords and encryption keys.</li>
<li><b>Performance Improvements</b>&nbsp;– Virtually every area of the platform has been updated and includes some major performance improvements, including SMB, iSCSI, ZFS and more.</li>
<li><b>API Keys</b>&nbsp;– All of TrueNAS can be configured with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/additional-topics/api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrueNAS API v2.0</a>&nbsp;and now supports API keys for remote access. The v1.0 API is no longer supported.</li>
<li><b>Fusion Pools</b> – Allows creating pools with all-flash vdevs that store metadata and small-block IO. This provides flash-like performance on all metadata operations, but with the cost-effectiveness of spinning disk for storage blocks.</li>
<li><b>VPN Support</b>&nbsp;– Support for TrueNAS acting as both an OpenVPN Server and Client, depending on your VPN needs.</li>
<li><b>TrueCommand Cloud Integration</b>&nbsp;– TrueNAS 12.0 systems can be connected directly to a TrueCommand Cloud account for scaled monitoring and management of your TrueNAS systems</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more on the official <a href="https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/intro/release-notes/tn-12_0-release/">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Now that our systems are moving to TrueNAS Core, FreeNAS is gone.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>You may not have seen this, but STH has actually had a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/buyers-guides/top-hardware-components-for-truenas-core-servers/">Top Hardware Components for TrueNAS Core Servers</a> for some time. If you are thinking of building a TrueNAS Core server, check that out.</p>
<p>The bigger item looming is TrueNAS Scale. We covered how <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ixsystems-starts-de-emphasizing-freebsd-for-truenas-scale-out-project/">iXsystems Starts De-emphasizing FreeBSD for TrueNAS Scale-Out Project</a>. While retiring the “FreeNAS” brand that aligned closely with “FreeBSD” the TrueNAS Scale platform we see as a clear future. With the ability to scale from a single node system like TrueNAS Core into a multi-node cluster, like Proxmox VE already can, the TrueNAS Scale Linux-based solution is where the company is headed longer term. Unifying FreeNAS and the TrueNAS Enterprise line helps the company move in this direction. For now, we do not recommend TrueNAS Scale because it is still an Alpha product, but it is certainly the one to watch.</p>
<p>At your readiness, it is time to do a few clicks, change the release train, and have a beer/ bourbon, or scotch to toast to FreeNAS retirement as the system reboots.</p>

                <h3>Test Automation</h3>
                <p>In today’s delivery methods like Agile and Continuous Delivery, every software dependent business is
                    focused to release quality software products often and faster than ever before.</p>
                <p>There are many factors that influence the delivery of software faster at reduced cost. According to
                    the WQR, slower time to market, increased QA costs and an over dependence on manual testing are a
                    major bottleneck in ensuring the release
                    of better products, faster.</p>
                <p>Its time every company shifted from Manual testing to Test Automation to address these challenges.
                </p>
                <p>The objective of software test automation is to simplify the software testing process as easy as
                    possible with minimum effort. Test Automation has a positive impact on the cost, quality and time to
                    market the software.</p><br>
            </div>

    <div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Aren’t manual tests really enough?</h3>
                <p>Not considering today’s software delivery needs.</p>
                <p>Enhancements or changes made to an application must be tested and retested to check that it does not
                    break the existing code. Test Automation is most effective in performing such regression tests on
                    multiple device/OS/browser combinations
                    with the help of Automated testing tools.</p>
                <p>This would be a tedious task, if done manually. Functional Testers need to go through every feature
                    of the application, look for possible input combinations, compare and document each outcome with the
                    expected one.</p>
                <p>In such short cycles it is difficult to test every feature of the application, manually. Manual
                    Testing would require a lot of resources, time and cost for this.</p>
                <p>Without Test Automation one has to compromise on the test coverage, which is not recommended.</p>
                <p>However, Manual Testing cannot be overlooked as it involves creative and logical analysis of the
                    application under test.</p>
                <p>There is a need of an integrated manual testing and test automation environment to improve the
                    collaboration between the teams and increase productivity. </p><br>

                <h3>Let’s look at a few benefits of Test Automation:</h3>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i></i>

                        <strong>
                            Test Automation speeds up the testing process</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once created, automated tests can be run over and again at no additional cost and can increase
                        the pace of executing tests in different versions of device, browser and OS combinations. This
                        reduces the testing time in each cycle.</p>
                </li>


                <li>

                            Test Automation increases Test Coverage</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>As the tests are automated you can choose to execute some or all of the tests to cover the
                        affected areas. You don't need to compromise on the coverage due to a lack of time towards the
                        end of the cycle.</p>
                    <p>Execute multiple complex tests across different OS/Device/Browser combinations and with different
                        Test Data sets that help increase the test coverage.</p>

                        <strong>Test Automation improves Accuracy</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Test Automation tools execute a set of scripted steps systematically and record the results every
                        time they are executed. The accuracy of results are more in less time compared to Manual
                        testing.</p>
                </li>


                <li>

                            Test Automation allows for faster delivery of products</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the test script is developed, the tests can be re-executed any number of times, anytime.
                        This allows the Functional testers to do exploratory testing and to check for the usability of
                        the product. Test Automation allows for a speedy delivery of better quality products into the
                        market.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>When writing JavaScript applications, you describe its dependencies using a <code>package.json</code> file. This file contains all of your applications direct dependencies and their versions.</p>

<p>If you’re building a RESTful API using Express, for, example, your <code>package.json</code> file will probably list <code>express</code> as a dependency.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Whenever you ask others to clone and run your application, they need to install its dependencies using <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause them to download the version <code>4.0.0</code> of Express.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock1.png" alt="An image showing that your application points to the Express pacakge, meaning it depends on it."></p>
<center><i>Your application's direct dependency on Express.</i></center>

<p>When installing Express, a package upon which your application depends, you will also download all of the packages upon which Express itself depends. Among the packages upon which Express depends, you can find, for example, <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/send"><code>send</code></a>, a package which provides a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918845/what-exactly-does-serving-static-files-mean">static file server</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock2.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which in turn points to the send package."></p>
<center><i>Express depends on `send`, which causes it to be downloaded when installing your application's dependencies.</i></center>

<p>Additionally, when installing Express and, consequently, <code>send</code>, you will have to install the dependencies of <code>send</code>. Because <code>send</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-types"><code>mime-types</code></a>, , a utility package to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type">mime-types</a>, NPM will install also install <code>mime-types</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock3.png" alt="Your application points to the Express package, which points to the send package, which then points to the mime-types package."></p>
<center><i>The `send` package depends upon `mime-types`.</i></center>

<p>Finally, when installing <code>mime-types</code>, NPM will notice that <code>mime-types</code> depends on <a href="https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db"><code>mime-db</code></a>, and will install <code>mime-db</code> too.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock4.png" alt="The dependency chain pointing from your application to express, then to send, then to mime-types, and, finally, pointing to mime-db."></p>
<center><i>NPM downloads the `mime-db` package when installing your application's dependencies because it's a dependency of other dependencies.</i></center>

<p>The process of recursively downloads all of your packages’ dependencies and the dependencies of those dependencies is what causes your <code>node_modules</code> folder to get heavy so quickly.</p>

<p>Even though you only listed <code>express</code> as a dependency, if you check your <code>node_modules</code> folder — the folder in which NPM stores dependencies — you will see that there are many more packages there.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>▾ node_modules/

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These packages are not only Express’ dependencies, but also the dependencies of <em>all</em> dependencies.</p>

<p>This dependency download process would be beautiful if it weren’t for the fact that <strong><code>npm install</code> doesn’t necessarily install the same dependencies given the same <code>package.json</code> file</strong>.</p>

<p>Running <code>npm install</code> in the afternoon can cause you to get different dependencies when compared to the <code>npm install</code> your colleague ran in the morning, even though none of you changed the version of Express upon which the application depends, for example.</p>

<p><strong>Having different dependencies is a problem because it can cause the application to present inconsistent behaviour across different environments, which is yet another cause for headaches when you’re trying to build reliable software</strong>.</p>





<p>When listing dependencies in your <code>package.json</code> file, you can prefix their versions with a <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>. Each of these symbols will tell NPM that it doesn’t necessarily need to download the exact version you specified. Instead, it will try to download a version which is “compatible” or “equivalent” to the one in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine, for example, that you prepended <code>^</code> to Express’ version number in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"my-app"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"version"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"1.0.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"main"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"index.js"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"express"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"^4.0.0"</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>In that case, if Express’ maintainers release a fix and bump their version number to <code>4.0.1</code>, running <code>npm install</code> would install the <code>4.0.1</code> version, not the <code>4.0.0</code> as you’ve written in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, when Express’ maintainers release a new feature and bump their version number to <code>4.1.0</code>, the <code>npm install</code> command will download <code>4.1.0</code>, which <em>should</em> be compatible with the <code>4.0.0</code> version you listed in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>Most of the time, using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> should <em>not</em> cause problems, because, according to <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, bumping <code>minor</code> — the middle version number — or <code>patch</code> — the rightmost version number — means that there are no breaking changes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lucasfcosta.com/assets/package-lock5.png" alt="In a 4.1.2 version, 4 is the major version number, which indicates breaking changes, 1 is the minor version number, which indicates new features, and 2 is the patch version number, which indicates fixes."></p>
<center><i>Bumping the leftmost version number indicates there have been breaking changes. The middle version number indicates a release contains new features. The rightmost number indicates fixes.</i></center>

<p>However, given enough time, all humans make mistakes. They may, for example, bump the <code>minor</code> or <code>patch</code> when there’s a breaking change, causing builds to break like I once did when I incorrectly released breaking changes to <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/">Chai</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/862">bumped the wrong version number</a>, causing millions of builds to break around the world.</p>

<p>So does this mean that <em>not</em> using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> causes <code>npm install</code> to <em>always</em> download the same dependency tree? No, it doesn’t 🙃</p>

<p><strong>Even though you may not add <code>^</code> or <code>~</code> in front of your dependencies’ versions, your dependencies may list <em>their</em> dependencies using <code>^</code> or <code>~</code>, which can cause <code>npm install</code> to download different versions depending on the time you’ve run it.</strong></p>

<p>If you’ve specified Express’ <code>4.0.0</code> version as a dependency, but Express itself listed <code>send</code> as a dependency using <code>^1.0.0</code>, for example, you could end-up downloading the version <code>1.0.1</code> of <code>send</code> in the morning, and version <code>1.0.2</code> in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the <code>send</code> package’s maintainers release breaking changes and incorrectly tag them as <code>1.0.2</code>, your application could break even though you locked <em>your application’s</em> dependencies by avoiding <code>^</code> and <code>~</code>.</p>





<p>The <code>package-lock.json</code> file lists your application’s dependencies and the dependencies of all its dependencies. In other words, it describes which version of every single package you have installed. That’s why it’s so much longer than <code>package.json</code>.
Whenever you use <code>package-lock.json</code> to install dependencies, you will get the exact same packages, it doesn’t matter whether you’re installing them now or in a thousand years when we’ll hopefully not be using keyboards anymore.</p>

<p>To install dependencies based on your <code>package-lock.json</code> file, you should use <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>By using <code>npm ci</code> you will be able to avoid problems which happen when an application works in your machine, but doesn’t work in someone else’s because they ended up downloading different dependencies due to using <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>That’s why, whenever running your builds in a <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day">continuous integration server</a>, you should install dependencies using <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code>. Doing so will cause the CI server’s build to run just like it had run in your machine.</p>

<p><strong>The reason <code>package-lock.json</code> may change automatically when you run <code>npm install</code> is because NPM is updating the <code>package-lock.json</code> file to accurately reflect all the dependencies it has downloaded since it may have gotten more up-to-date versions of some of them.</strong> Once NPM updates the <code>package-lock.json</code> file, others can get those exact same versions by using <code>npm ci</code> if they want.</p>





<p>Sometimes, <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/">evil human-beings will obtain control of other people’s NPM credentials and release new versions of packages by bumping the package’s <code>patch</code> version number, causing millions of dependants to download the malicious piece of code</a>.</p>

<p>It’s enough for a single package in your entire dependency tree to be compromised for you to end-up downloading the malicious code. Sometimes, the compromised package will not even be a direct dependency of your application or even a dependency of one of your application’s dependencies. It may be, for example, a dependency of a dependency of a dependency of a dependency.</p>

<p>Because <code>npm ci</code> will cause you to download the exact same packages every time, it will be less likely for you to install malicious code given you have taken the necessary security precautions.</p>





<p><em>Most of the time</em>, package maintainers will bump the correct version numbers when releasing features or fixes, and there is no harm in having these features and fixes in. If anything, they may make your application faster or solve a bug you have.</p>

<p>In other words, having <code>npm install</code> makes it easier to get the “best” versions of packages: the ones with more features and fixes.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm ci</code> exist for slightly different purposes. While the former installs the latest possible versions of your dependencies, the latter installs the exact same versions you had when you last used <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>An additional advantage of using <code>npm ci</code> is its quicker execution. The <code>npm ci</code> command runs faster than <code>npm install</code> because it doesn’t need to check what’s the latest compatible version of a package. Instead, it knows exactly which version to fetch thanks to the exhaustive dependency list in <code>package-lock.json</code>. <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable">In some cases, dependency installations can happen twice as fast</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>install</code> doesn’t by default use <code>package-lock.json</code>, is somewhat controversial, though. Some people would advocate that updating dependencies by default is significantly dangerous and that one should be very explicit when doing it.</p>





<p>Personally, I like to use <code>npm install</code> whenever I’m installing dependencies myself, and <code>npm ci</code> in all my scripts.</p>

<p>I use <code>npm install</code> when installing dependencies myself because, in that case, I can vet which versions I get and make sure that I’ll be using the latest versions of packages, which can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I don’t want any of my scripts to update dependencies because machines running automated …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>In one particular context.</p>


<p>A while back, a colleague wanted to make a major change in the design of a system, the sort of change that was going to take a year or more, and many tens of person-years of effort. They asked me how to justify the project. This post is part of the email reply I sent. The advice is in context of technical leadership work at a big company, but perhaps it may apply elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right solution?</strong></p>

<p>I like to pay attention to ways I can easily fool myself. One of those ways is an <em>availability heuristic</em> applied to big problems. I see a big problem that needs a big solution, and am strongly biased to believe that the first big solution that presents itself is the right one. It takes intentional effort to figure out whether the big solution is, indeed, a solution to the big problem. Bold action, after all, isn't a solution itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes, in one of his more exuberant or desperate moods, Pa would go out in the veld and sprinkle brandy on the daisies to make them drunk so that they wouldn't feel the pain of shriveling up and dying. (André Brink)</p></blockquote>

<p>Because I am so easily fooled in this way, I like to write my reasoning down. Two pages of prose normally does it, building an argument as to why this is the right solution to the problem. Almost every time, this exposes flaws in my reasoning, opportunities to find more data, or other solutions to explore. Thinking in my head doesn't have this effect for me, but writing does. Or, rather, the exercise of writing and reading does.</p>

<p>The first step is to write a succinct description of the problem, and what it means for the problem to be solved. Sometimes those are quantitative goals. Speeds and feeds. Sometimes, they are concrete goals. A product launch, or a document. Sometimes, it's something more qualitative and harder to explain. Thinking about the problem bears a great deal of fruit.</p>

<p>Then, the solution. The usual questions apply here, including cost, viability, scope and complexity. Most important is engaging with the problem statement. It's easy to make the exercise useless if you disconnect the problem statement from the solution.</p>

<p>It is important you feel comfortable with the outcome of this exercise, because losing faith in your own work is a sure way to have it fail. Confidence is one valuable outcome. Another one is a simpler solution.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right problem?</strong></p>

<p>An elegant solution to the wrong problem is worse than no solution at all, at least in that it might fool people into thinking that the true problem has been solved, and to stop trying. You need to deeply understand the problem you are solving. Rarely, this will be an exercise only in technology or engineering. More commonly, large problems will span business, finance, engineering, management and more. You probably don't understand all of these things. Be sure to seek the help of people who do.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once I think I understand multiple perspectives on a problem, I like to write them down and run them by the people who explained the problem to me. They'll be able to point out where you're still wrong. Perhaps you're confusing your net and operational margins, or your hiring targets make no sense, or your customers see a different problem from you. This requires that the people you consult trust you, and you trust them. Fortunately, non-engineers in engineering organizations are always looking out for allies and friends. Most are, like engineers, only too excited to explain their work.</p>

<p><strong>Engage with the doubters, but don't let them get you down</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you (Tom Lehrer)</p></blockquote>

<p>You will never convince everybody of your point of view. By now, you have two powerful tools to help convince people: A clear statement of the problem that considers multiple points-of-view, and a clear statement of the solution. Some people will read those and be convinced. Others would never be convinced, because their objections lie beyond the scope of your thinking. A third group will have real, honest, feedback about the problem and proposed solution. That feedback is gold that should be mined. Unfortunately, separating the golden nuggets of feedback from the pyrite nuggets of doubt isn't easy.</p>

<p>The doubters will get you down. Perhaps they think the problem doesn't exist, or that the solution is impractical. Perhaps they think you aren't the person to do it. Perhaps they think the same resources should be spent on a different problem, or a different solution. You'll repeat, repeat, and repeat. Get used to it. I'm still not used to it, but you should be.</p>

<p>Again, writing is a tool I reach for. "Today, I'm doubting my solution because..." Sometimes that doubt will be something more about you than the project. That's OK. Sometime it'll be about the project, and will identify a real problem. Often, it'll just point to one of those unknown unknowns that all projects have.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the stakeholders where they are</strong></p>

<p>Most likely, you're going to need to convince somebody to let you do the work. That's good, because doing big things requires time, people and money. You don't want to be working somewhere that's willing to waste time, people or money. If they're willing to waste time on your ill-conceived schemes, they'll be willing to waste your time on somebody else's ill-conceived schemes.</p>

<blockquote><p>May your wisdom grace us until the stars rain down from the heavens. (C.S. Lewis)</p></blockquote>

<p>The best advice I've received about convincing stakeholders is to write for them, not you. Try to predict what questions they are going to ask, what concerns they will have, and what objections they will bring up and have answers for those in the text. That doesn't mean you should be defensive. Don't aim only to flatter. Instead, tailor your approach. It can help to have the advice of people who've been through this journey before.</p>

<p>The previous paragraph may seem to you like <em>politics</em>, you may have a distaste for politics, or believe you can escape it by moving to a different business. It is. You may. You can't.</p>

<p>Leadership willing to engage with your ideas and challenge you on them is a blessing.</p>

<p><strong>Build a team</strong></p>

<p>You need to build two teams. Your local team is the team of engineers who are going to help you write, review, test, deploy, operate, and so on. These people are critical to your success, not because they are the fingers to your brain, but because the details are at least as important as the big picture. Get into some details yourself. Don't get into every detail. You can't.</p>

<p>Your extended team is a group of experts, managers, customer-facing folks, product managers, lawyers, designers and so on. Some of these people won't be engaged day-to-day. You need to find them, get them involved, and draw on them when you need help. You're not an expert in everything, but expertise in everything will be needed. Getting these people excited about your project, and bought into its success, is important.</p>

<p>Finally, find yourself a small group of people you trust, and ask them to keep you honest. Check in with them, to make sure your ideas still make sense. Share the documents you wrote with them.</p>

<p><strong>Be willing to adapt</strong></p>

<p>You will learn, at some point into doing your big project, that your solution is bullshit. You completely misunderstood the problem. You may feel like this leaves you back at the beginning, where you started. It doesn't. Instead, you've stepped up your level of expertise. Most likely, you can adapt that carefully-considered solution to the new problem, but you might need to throw it out entirely. Again, write it down. Be specific. What have you learned, and what did it teach you? Look for things you can recover, and don't throw things out prematurely.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>Say you're about to build a new project. You're an expert in a few languages, and you have a sense of the ecosystem in general. How do you choose the language you build with? I wanted to share my decision framework with you. </p><p>Some requirements can eliminate entire categories of choices. Let’s use that to our advantage: start by narrowing down your choices. For example:</p><p><strong>Do you need extreme efficiency?</strong> This would mean your code may need to be compiled and that you can’t have run-time garbage collection. Well, that narrows down your choices quite a bit. </p><p><strong>Do you need math-level proofs that your code works as expected?</strong> This would mean you need an <em>extremely</em> strong type system. Bam, narrows choices down quite a bit </p><p><strong>Do you need concurrency?</strong> There are only a few VMs and a few languages that are known to be <em>excellent</em> for concurrency. Depending on what you need, this will narrow your choices down to a few families.</p><p><strong>Do you work in a larger environment?</strong> If you are building something, and your entire company is on one stack, there’s so much power to the existing ecosystem that this effectively narrows down your choice to the language of your environment.<sup>1</sup></p><p><strong>Is your problem in a domain where the ecosystem in one language is strongest?</strong> If you’re in machine learning, the ecosystem in python is so powerful that it almost guarantees to narrow down your choice to that language.</p><p><strong>Is your problem a small script that needs to run everywhere?</strong> This narrows your choices down to the languages that are available by default on Linux</p><p>Now, there’s a leverage point here: constraints narrow down your choices in a significant way. If you add a constraint you didn’t need, you risk sacrificing a large set of options. For example, many think their system needs to scale from the get-go. This is rarely the case and kills some of the choices that contributed to the success of the biggest companies today <sup>2</sup></p><p>So pick your constraints carefully. Once you do though, you’ll be pleasantly surprised with how much clarity they give you: your choices will have gone through a significant filter.</p><p>The next filter is effectiveness. Choose the language that maximizes your output on a time scale you care about.</p><p>At this stage, there is often a tradeoff between what you’re comfortable with and what you need to discover. Say you’re comfortable in assembly, but don’t know any other languages. What should you do?</p><p>Well, for some very small problems, it <em>does</em> make sense to just write them in assembly. If they’re urgent, you have no other choice. But for any significant work, you’ll outstrip the productivity of assembly within a few days of ramp-up. </p><p>The same kind of spectrum exists in higher-level languages, but the differences take longer to show up. If you’re comfortable with Java, for example, you can get a lot done pretty quickly. But within <em>some</em> period, the productivity benefits pale in comparison to more powerful languages.</p><p>Making this choice is a bit of an art, but it works like this. You want to think about a time-frame that you’d like to optimize and pick the language that optimizes for effectiveness within that timeframe. </p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you have no choice but to use what you’re comfortable with, no matter how limiting. There are two ways to avoid the dilemma. You can either play with different languages before you start your project, so you have a wider array of comfortable choices to pick from, or give yourself a few months to ramp up and select the language that’s most effective for your problem.</p><p>With that, the question comes, <em>what time frame</em> should you optimize for? This is in itself an art. For startups, I would say about 8-12 months. Planning further than that is over-optimization. For larger companies, I’d think 2-5 years.</p><p>Now you’ve gone through two filters. Say you narrowed down to just a few choices, but you aren’t sure which one to take. How should you break the tie? </p><p>I’d say fun. There are so many schleps in a startup that programming should be as fun as possible. Once. I narrowed down. I’d choose the language I’m most excited about.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Sean Grove, Daniel Woelfel, Joe Averbukh, Alex Reichert for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>About 6 years ago, when I was in my first few months at Pebble as a firmware engineer, I decided to take an entire workday to read through the majority of the GDB manual. It was by far one of my best decisions as an early professional engineer. After that day, I felt like I was 10x faster at debugging the Pebble firmware and our suite of unit tests. I even had a new <code>.gdbinit</code> script with a few macros and configuration flags to boot, which I continue to amend to this day.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve learned from many firmware developers and am here writing this post to share what I’ve learned along the way. If you have any comments or suggestions about this post, I would love to hear from you in <a href="https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/">Interrupt’s Slack channel</a>.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this reference-style post, we discuss some of the more advanced and powerful commands of the GNU debugger, GDB, as well as cover some of the best practices and hacks I’ve found over the years that help make GDB more pleasant to use.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>Although there might be debuggers and interfaces out there that provide better experiences than using GDB directly, many of them are built on top of GDB and provide raw access to the GDB shell, where you can build and use automation through the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">Python scripting API</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the end of most of the sections, there are links to either subpages with the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/">GDB manual</a> or to the original content to learn more about the topic discussed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="essentials">Essentials</h2>

<p>First, we need to cover the items which I feel are most important for any developer or team to work efficiently within GDB.</p>



<p>There’s no better place to start learning GDB than to first learn how to search the help menus. Surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, GDB has over 1500+ commands!</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Count number of GDB commands in the master help list
$ gdb --batch -ex 'help all' | grep '\-\-' | wc
    1512   16248  117306
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in mind, the most useful command within GDB is <code>apropos</code>, which searches all the “help” menus of each command. To use it, simply type <code>apropos &lt;regex&gt;</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) apropos symbol
add-symbol-file -- Load symbols from FILE, assuming FILE has been dynamically loaded.
add-symbol-file-from-memory -- Load the symbols out of memory from a dynamically loaded object file.
attach -- Attach to a process or file outside of GDB.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To get the individual help menu of any command in GDB, just type <code>help &lt;command&gt;</code>, and GDB will output everything it knows about the command or subcommand.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help apropos
Search for commands matching a REGEXP
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If help is used on a collection of commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) help info
Generic command for showing things about the program being debugged.

List of info subcommands:

info address -- Describe where symbol SYM is stored.
info all-registers -- List of all registers and their contents, for selected stack frame.
info args -- All argument variables of current stack frame or those matching REGEXPs.
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html#index-apropos">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="gdb-history">GDB History</h3>

<p>Next, we need to ensure that command history is enabled.</p>

<p>By default GDB does not save any history of the commands that were run during each session. This is especially annoying because GDB supports <code>CTRL+R</code> for history search just like your shell!</p>

<p>To fix this, we can place the following in our <code>.gdbinit</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>set history save on
set history size 10000
set history filename ~/.gdb_history
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this in place, GDB will now keep the last 10,000 commands in a file ~/.gdb_history.</p>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Command-History.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="sharing-gdbinit-files">Sharing <code>.gdbinit</code> Files</h3>

<p>I’m a huge believer in developer productivity, and I try my best to share my best-practices with co-workers and the greater community. In the past, I’ve made it a point to have per-project GDB configuration files that are automatically loaded for everyone by default.</p>

<p>This could be in a bash script <code>debug.sh</code> which developers use instead of typing <code>gdb</code> and all the arguments by hand:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

gdb build/symbols.elf <span>\</span>
    <span>-ix</span><span>=</span>./gdb/project.gdbinit <span>\</span>
    <span>--ex</span><span>=</span><span>'source ./gdb/extra_gdb.py'</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Better yet, you can build a <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/building-a-cli-for-firmware-projects">Project CLI using Invoke</a> which wraps the GDB invocation into an <code>invoke debug</code> command.</p>

<p>This ensures that everyone working on the project has the latest set of configuration flags and <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api">GDB Python scripts</a> to accelerate their debugging.</p>

<h2 id="source-files">Source Files</h2>

<p>With the essentials out of the way, let’s dive into learning GDB! The first thing to talk about is how best to view and navigate the source code while debugging.</p>

<h3 id="directory-search-paths">Directory Search Paths</h3>

<p>Many times, the CI system builds with absolute paths instead of paths relative to the project root, which causes GDB not to be able to find the source files.</p>

<p>It will produce an error like below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) f 1
#2  cli_state_collect (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:1952
1952	../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:
    No such file or directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you are proactive and want to fix this permanently in the build step, you can follow the steps in Interrupt’s post about <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/reproducible-firmware-builds">Reproducible Firmware Builds</a> to make the paths relative.</p>

<p>If you want to patch it up now in GDB, you can use a combination of the <code>set substitute-path</code> and <code>directory</code> commands in GDB, depending on how the paths are built.</p>

<p>To fix the above issue, all I needed to do was to add a local directory. After adding it, GDB can find the source code of the line in the frame.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) directory sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk/
Source directories searched: /[...]/sdk/embedded/platforms/nrf5/nrf5_sdk:$cdir:$cwd
(gdb) f 1
#1  0x000292a2 in cli_execute (p_cli=0x3ad00 &lt;m_cli&gt;) at
    ../nrf5_sdk/components/libraries/cli/nrf_cli.c:2554
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="source-context-with-list">Source Context with <code>list</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes, you just want to quickly add a few lines above and below the current line. To quickly view ten lines of source-code context within GDB, you can use the <code>list</code> command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) list
2549	                &amp;p_static_entry,
2550	                &amp;static_entry);
2551
2552	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd = p_static_entry;
2553
2554	        p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;p_current_stcmd-&gt;handler(p_cli,
2555	                                               argc - cmd_handler_lvl,
2556	                                               &amp;argv[cmd_handler_lvl]);
2557	    }
2558	    else if (handler_cmd_lvl_0 != NULL)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to set a larger or smaller default number of lines shown with this command, you can change the setting:</p>



<p><a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/List.html">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="viewing-assembly-with-disassemble">Viewing Assembly With <code>disassemble</code></h3>

<p>It’s often useful to dive into the assembly of a specific function. GDB has this capability built-in and can even interleave the source code with the assembly (by using the <code>/s</code> option).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) disassemble /s nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on
Dump of assembler code for function nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on:
nrf_cli.c:
3511	{
3512	    if (nrf_cli_build_in_cmd_common_executed(p_cli, (argc != 1), NULL, 0))
   0x0002969c &lt;+0&gt;:	ldr	r3, [r0, #8]
   0x0002969e &lt;+2&gt;:	ldr.w	r2, [r3, #316]	; 0x13c

nrf_cli.h:
604	    return p_cli-&gt;p_ctx-&gt;internal.flag.show_help;
   0x000296a2 &lt;+6&gt;:	lsls	r2, r2, #30
   0x000296a4 &lt;+8&gt;:	bmi.n	0x296b8 &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+28&gt;

nrf_cli.c:
3391	    if (arg_cnt_nok)
   0x000296a6 &lt;+10&gt;:	cmp	r1, #1
   0x000296a8 &lt;+12&gt;:	bne.n	0x296bc &lt;nrf_cli_cmd_echo_on+32&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want something more powerful than <code>disassemble</code>, you can use <code>objdump</code> itself. Interrupt’s <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gnu-binutils#objdump">post on GNU Binutils</a> is a great reference for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Machine-Code.html">Reference</a></p>

<h2 id="gdb-visual-interfaces">GDB Visual Interfaces</h2>

<p>There are many visual interfaces that are built into or on top of GDB. Let’s go through a few of the most popular ones.</p>

<h3 id="gdb-tui">GDB TUI</h3>

<p>GDB has a built-in graphical interface for viewing source code, registers, assembly, and other various items, and it’s quite simple to use!</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/advanced-gdb/gdb-tui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can start the TUI interface by running:</p>



<p>This should give you the source code viewer. You are now able to type <code>next</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>continue</code>, etc. and the TUI interface will update and follow along.</p>

<p>If you want to view the assembly as well, you can run:</p>



<p>To show the registers at the top of the window, you can type:</p>



<h3 id="alternate-gdb-interfaces">Alternate GDB Interfaces</h3>

<p>Although TUI is nice, I don’t know many people who use it and see it more as a gimmick. It’s great for quick observations and exploration, but I would suggest spending the 15-30 minutes to get something set up that is more powerful and permanent.</p>

<p>I would suggest looking into using <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">gdb-dashboard</a> or <a href="https://github.com/vim-scripts/Conque-GDB">Conque-GDB</a> if you’d like to stick with using GDB itself.</p>

<p>For a full list of GUI enhancements to GDB, you can check out the list of plugins from my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/gdbundle-plugin-manager#neat-gdb-script-repositories">previous post on GDBundle</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gdbgui">gdbgui</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gdbgui.com/">gdbgui</a> is a browser-based frontend to GDB, built by Chad Smith, who also happens to be the author of another one of my favorite tools, <a href="https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx">pipx</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs01/gdbgui/master/screenshots/gdbgui.png" alt=""></p>

<p>gdbgui is great tool if you don’t want to use a vendor-provided debugger but still want to have a visual way to interface with GDB.</p>

<h3 id="vscode">VSCode</h3>

<p>VSCode has pretty good support for GDB baked in. If you are just using GDB to debug C/C++ code locally on your machine, you should be able to follow the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cpp-debug">official instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to do remote debugging on devices connected with OpenOCD, PyOCD, or JLink, you’ll want to look into the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide">Platform.io</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug">Cortex-Debug</a> extensions.</p>

<h2 id="registers">Registers</h2>

<p>The next topic to cover is interacting with registers through GDB.</p>

<h3 id="printing-registers">Printing Registers</h3>

<p>You can print the register values within GDB using <code>info registers</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) info registers
r0             0x2                 2
r1             0x7530              30000

          <p><span>Published on: <time datetime="2020-10-05">October 5, 2020</time></span></p><p>I recently completed a major overhaul of <a href="https://github.com/nickbabcock/jomini">a Javascript library of mine</a>. This overhaul replaced a pure JS parser (generated by <a href="https://github.com/zaach/jison">jison</a>) with one that delegated parsing to <a href="https://github.com/rakaly/jomini">an implementation written in Rust</a> compiled to <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Webassembly (Wasm)</a>. I want to share my journey, as overall it’s been positive and I expect that other JS libraries could benefit from this approach.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The parser in question turns a proprietary format that is akin to JSON and looks like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">tag=AAA
name="Jåhkåmåhkke"
core=BBB
buildings={ 1 2 }
core=CCC
</code></pre></div><p>and returns a plain javascript object</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">{
  tag: "AAA",
  name: "Jåhkåmåhkke",
  core: ["BBB", "CCC"],
  buildings: [1, 2]
}
</code></pre></div><p>So what were the pain points of the original JS implementation?</p>
<h2 id="original-motivation">Original Motivation</h2>
<p>Soon after releasing the JS library I stopped actively developing it. The files that I want to parse are millions of lines long which could result in tens of millions of JS values (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, and dates). Parsing and allocating this many objects was taxing enough that back in 2015 I found no way to practically run it – the memory pressure caused nodejs to run out of heap space and when the code didn’t crash, the time required to parse said files would easily reach 30-60 seconds.</p>
<p>In 2020, I wrote this parser in Rust. The results have been fantastic: zero-copy parsing at 1 GB/s.</p>
<p>But speed wasn’t the only contributing factor. In fact, I firmly believe that someone could design a performant (but maybe not as performant) of an API around this format in pure JS. The other big motivating factor is accuracy and consistency. In no way do I own or control this proprietary format, so new syntax is stumbled upon all the time. Most recently data like</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">levels = { 10 0=1 0=2 }
color = hex { eeeeee }
color = rgb { 0 100 150 }
</code></pre></div><p>So when I doubled down to cover all known syntax in Rust, I couldn’t imagine duplicating that effort for other languages and then keeping the parsing logic in sync. The Rust parser has been battle proven in multiple projects and I don’t want to start from scratch for a new language. To me, it seems preferable to have one implementation and bind others to it. Considering I’ve written this parser in C#, F#, JS, and most recently Rust – anything that cuts down on maintenance work is desirable.</p>
<p>My mind shifted to the JS implementation. Rust can compile to Wasm and both nodejs and browsers can execute Wasm, so rewriting the JS parser to delegate to Wasm seemed like the first step in determining how feasible it is to have all logic contained in Rust.</p>
<p>I should note that .NET languages can utilize Wasmtime to run Wasm, but this is not as mature. I wanted to start prototyping Wasm on the most mature platforms. Part of this process was to test if Wasm is too immature for a given ecosystem. In a fledgling Wasm ecosystem one could still be able to dip down to interoperating with native libraries (though native libraries have their own tradeoffs).</p>
<h2 id="rust-wasm-and-the-js-wrapper">Rust Wasm and the JS Wrapper</h2>
<p>This won’t be a tutorial on Rust and tools (<a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/">wasm-bindgen</a> and <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/">wasm-pack</a>). I suggest reading their respective books and tutorials.</p>
<p>My view is that one should always write a JS wrapper for the Wasm that exposes the Rust code as idiomatically as possible instead of making the Wasm a separate NPM package. To me, an idiomatic design means the loading and compiling of Wasm is entirely user driven. For instance, I have users create instances through a static <code>initialize</code> function that transparently handles the wasm.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>import</span> <span>init</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>the_wasm</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./pkg/jomini_js_bg.wasm"</span>;

<span>let</span> <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>;
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>Jomini</span> {
  <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span>() {}

  <span>/* snip member functions that use wasm functions */</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>initialize</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> () <span>=&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span><span>initialized</span>) {
      <span>// @ts-ignore
</span><span></span>      <span>await</span> <span>init</span>(<span>the_wasm</span>());
      <span>initialized</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Jomini</span>();
  };
}
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that the wasm is cached on subsequent <code>initialize</code> invocations. Small Wasm bundles can still incur a non-negligible performance tax (50 kb compiles in 20ms), so cache them.</p>
<p>And in case you are curious about performance, it’s great! The Wasm implementation can parse a 1.3 million line file in 160ms. Considering parsing it in Rust takes 70ms, I think this is a great outcome. What might come as a bit of a performance shock is that deserializing the parsed data to a JS object takes over 6 seconds! I find this incredible – object creation can be more expensive than parsing. Expensive object creation isn’t restricted to JS either, <a href="https://github.com/TkTech/pysimdjson#-benchmarks">python is also afflicted</a>. We can fix this with a bit of ingenuity.</p>
<h2 id="wasm-lifetimes">Wasm Lifetimes</h2>
<p>The parser is zero-copy, but as shown it can be too expensive to serialize the parsed data to a JS object. The solution is to do less work: have the user specify the data they are interested in ahead of time using <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901">JSON pointer</a> syntax. The below example extracts the player and then extracts the <code>prestige</code> field from the player’s country.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> } <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(
  <span>buffer</span>,
  { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> },
  (<span>query</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>"/player"</span>);
    <span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>query</span>.<span>at</span>(<span>`/countries/</span><span>${</span><span>player</span><span>}</span><span>/prestige`</span>);
    <span>return</span> { <span>player</span>, <span>prestige</span> };
  }
);
</code></pre></div><p>The alternative would be doing the same operations but on the decoded object.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>readFileSync</span>(<span>args</span>[<span>0</span>]);
<span>const</span> <span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>Jomini</span>.<span>initialize</span>();
<span>const</span> <span>save</span> <span>=</span> <span>parser</span>.<span>parseText</span>(<span>buffer</span>, { <span>encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>"windows1252"</span> });
<span>const</span> <span>player</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>player</span>;
<span>const</span> <span>prestige</span> <span>=</span> <span>save</span>.<span>countries</span>[<span>player</span>].<span>prestige</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Querying for just the interesting bits completes 40x faster (6.3s vs 0.16s) and uses about half the memory.</p>
<p>How this query API is accomplished with a zero-copy parser (a struct that has a lifetime to the underlying data) is a bit tricky, as <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/423">wasm-bindgen doesn’t let one expose a struct with a lifetime</a>. The solution looks as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Query</span> {
    _backing_data: Vec<span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span>,
    tape: <span>TextTape</span><span>&lt;</span>'static<span>&gt;</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p>This struct works as desired through a two pronged approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We transmute away the lifetime of <code>tape</code> to static so that we can store it in a wasm-bindgen compatible struct. This is the only <code>unsafe</code> operation – and it has to be unsafe as we’re exposing this to JS and Rust can’t borrow check JS usage.</li>
<li>It’s important to own the data that was parsed so that our referenced data isn’t reclaimed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is also why the API is exposed in a callback, so that the user extracts the data they are interested in and at the end of the callback, <code>Query</code> is freed (a method generated by wasm-bindgen on exposed structs) for the user so they don’t have to worry about manual memory management. This goes back to ensuring that users have an idiomatic API at their disposal.</p>
<h2 id="bundling">Bundling</h2>
<p>This will be the most opinionated section here. I prefer projects with a small number of dev dependencies and a minimal amount of configuration.</p>
<p>Here’s the build step from <code>package.json</code>: we manually call wasm-pack and remove any previous invocations</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
    <span>"build"</span>: <span>"wasm-pack build -t web --out-dir ../src/pkg crate &amp;&amp; rm -rf dist/ &amp;&amp; rollup -c"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>And the rollup config is also simplistic</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>import</span> { <span>wasm</span> } <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-wasm"</span>;
<span>import</span> <span>typescript</span> <span>from</span> <span>"@rollup/plugin-typescript"</span>;

<span>const</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>=</span> (<span>fmt</span>) =&gt; ({
  <span>input</span><span>:</span> <span>"src/index.ts"</span>,
  <span>output</span><span>:</span> {
    <span>dir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span>,
    <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>fmt</span>,
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>"jomini"</span>,
  },
  <span>plugins</span><span>:</span> [
    <span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> }),
    <span>typescript</span>({ <span>outDir</span><span>:</span> <span>`dist/</span><span>${</span><span>fmt</span><span>}</span><span>`</span> }),
  ],
});

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> [<span>rolls</span>(<span>"cjs"</span>), <span>rolls</span>(<span>"es"</span>)];
</code></pre></div><p>Rollup is used as it’s the best tool to generate both CommonJS and ES modules. CommonJS for the nodejs folks and ES modules for those using bundlers that can take advantage of tree shaking to remove unused code. The tree shaking is partially limited by the support code that the Wasm bundle executes on load (ie: setting up heap), but this shouldn’t be too restrictive especially if the main API of a library uses Wasm. Make sure that your <code>package.json</code> contains the appropriate references to the modules and types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"main"</span>: <span>"./dist/cjs/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"module"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/index.js"</span>,
  <span>"types"</span>: <span>"./dist/es/lib/index.d.ts"</span>,
  <span>"files"</span>: [<span>"dist"</span>]
}
</code></pre></div><p>For those curious, I’ve eschewed the <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust"><code>@wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust</code></a> package as sometimes introducing a middleman doesn’t significantly cut down on code and it introduces another layer to debug when things go wrong.</p>
<p>It’s easy to miss in the config snippet, but the below function inlines our Wasm as a base64 encoded string if our Wasm is less than 100kb (an arbitrarily chosen number that is larger than our bundle)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>wasm</span>({ <span>maxFileSize</span><span>:</span> <span>100000</span> })
</code></pre></div><p>The Wasm itself is still compiled asynchronously. If we omitted <code>maxFileSize</code>, then the Wasm file would be generated as a complementary file. An additional file that has to be fetched is not desirable, as it would be surprising behavior for clients who may not be aware of all the implications from direct or transitive dependencies (ie: they may need a build system that understands Wasm if they are deploying to the web). By inlining as base64 we make the Wasm an implementation detail (for node 12+ and the vast majority of browser users). Yes, base64 does cause the Wasm bundle to grow ~33% but this is offset by two factors: compression, so the cost of transferring across the network is less than 33%, and the Wasm bundles generated by Rust tend to be small. As long as one stays cognizant of file sizes this shouldn’t be an issue. For me, the generated Wasm bundle is 54 KB and <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=jomini@0.3.3">bundlephobia lists the total bundle size (JS + inlined base64 Wasm) as 33.4 KB after minification and compression</a>, which is smaller than <code>react-dom</code> (35.6 KB). In my opinion this price is easily justified. If the Wasm bundle is significantly larger, I suspect the likelihood of clients being aware of their dependency implications increases, so one can opt to supply the Wasm bundle as a separate file.</p>

<p>The term technical debt is so common that you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the software world that hasn’t heard of it. But what <em>is </em>technical debt? There are a few frameworks out there, so I’ll list them quickly, but I’d like to present one I’ve found especially useful with the teams I work on or advise.</p>



<h4>Existing Frameworks</h4>



<p>First, it’s helpful to define what technical debt is <em>not</em>. Bob Martin has a great article on this called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/a-mess-is-not-a-technical-debt">A Mess is not a Technical Debt</a>. “A mess is just a mess”. You can make short-term decisions that may not be best for the long-term, if you’re under constraints, but you should still do it in a prudent way.</p>



<p>Martin Fowler expands on this by creating a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html">Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, with two dimensions: deliberate vs. inadvertent, and reckless vs. prudent.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/37Nx_D515LmtBbvoQEq0CjgtoEzjdBur2GBmJ2bklYsXQLlwlB0vSI6awa7KqUmG5Kdx7ADsI9ukzSoJZLnMg_sXF2ph6pJbr1LGR7YS9ubiKZr9TWtMpsLb_Srm89vfSEtbkiUO" alt=""></figure>



<p>Ideally, you’re in the right half of this two-by-two: always prudent, because there’s no excuse for being reckless. But, if you’re low on experience for the type of system you’re designing, you might be prudent and inadvertent. Martin Fowler argues that prudent / inadvertent is really common with great designers, because they are always learning.</p>



<p>One of my favorite frameworks is from the Mythical Man-Month’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">No Silver Bullet</a> essay. Fred Brooks breaks down complexity (which is a little different than technical debt) into to dimensions: accidental complexity and essential complexity. Essential complexity is caused by the complexity of the underlying problem that software solves—accidental complexity is introduced by the implementation developers take. In this world, technical debt is, essentially all accidental complexity.</p>



<p>A final framework defines technical debt as the gap between how software is structured and how you would structure it if you were writing it from scratch today (I don’t remember where I read this definition, please tell me if you do!). In this world, technical debt is a little more fluid, because it can increase simply by your team thinking up a better architecture or design.</p>



<h4>A different framework—manifestations</h4>



<p>These frameworks are all great, and in fact, you can go even deeper to define what technical debt <em>looks like</em>. Books like Refactoring and Clean Code have done this well. But usually, what you need, is something a little more concrete that you can make decisions about.</p>



<p>So the framework I like to use is to look at <em>manifestations</em> of technical debt; what impact does it have?</p>



<p>At a high-level, technical debt can manifest itself in two ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interrupts:</strong> Interrupts are when existing systems are taxing your time through reactive work like maintenance, bugs, fire-fighting, etc, so you spend less time being able to change a system. In other words, writing code now that creates interrupts in the future means you (or someone else) will be able to spend less time on forward work in the future. Both the quantity and severity of interrupts matter. Interrupts are particularly hazardous because they usually result in forced context switching.</li><li><strong>Inertia: </strong>Inertia means that a system is hard to make forward changes to (because it is hard to understand or reason about, because it’s not modular and hence hard to change, etc). This makes forward work difficult for you (ie even when you can spend time doing forward work, it’s really slow) or for others (e.g. because the system is hard to understand, it is a tax on the time of people who need to learn more about it, as well as on people who need to explain to others how it works).</li></ul>



<p>Why look at the manifestations? Two reasons.</p>



<p>First, it helps identify the tangible symptoms and effect of technical debt, and helps avoid theoreticals. For instance, most teams have at least one part of their code base that they feel pretty bad about, and would love to spend time fixing. Is it worth fixing now? Sometimes, that code is well-isolated and pretty functional. It isn’t creating any interrupts. No one is changing it or will need to change it in the near future. So yes, it is technical debt, and it might have inertia, but inertia only matters if that code needs to be changed.</p>



<p>Secondly, by identifying the effects of technical debt, you can decide how best to fix it. For instance, if a piece of code is really hard to change because it suffers from <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Software_Design/Change_amplification#:~:text=As%20a%20code%20quality%2C%20change,atomic%20change%20to%20the%20software.">change amplification</a>, and you expect to be making a lot of changes to it, it’s probably worth refactoring. If a piece of code is creating a lot of interrupts and not creating value for users, you might want to just get rid of it entirely.</p>



<p>So sometimes, it’s useful to start with the symptoms before the diagnoses, and look at how technical debt manifests itself before deciding what to do about it.</p>

For the first time now, researchers at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (also known as “KIT”) in Germany have succeeded in developing a computer system that outperforms humans in recognizing spontaneously spoken language with minimum latency.&nbsp;</p><p>This is reported on the Internet platform <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2010.03449&amp;t=MjZiNmJkMDEzMjQ0YTlhNjA4ZjA2ZDJlZmFmODU0NTczOGZlMjliOSxmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603502155">ArXiv.org</a>.</p><p>“When people talk to each other, there are stops, stutterings, hesitations, such as “er” or “hmmm”, laughs and coughs,” says Alex Waibel, Professor for Informatics at KIT. “Often, words are pronounced unclearly.” This makes it difficult even for people to make accurate notes of a conversation. “And so far, this has been even more difficult for AI,” adds the speech recognition expert. KIT scientists and staff of KITES, a start-up company from KIT, have now programmed a computer system that executes this task better than humans and quicker than other systems.</p><p>Waibel already developed an automatic live translator that directly translates university lectures from German or English into the languages spoken by foreign students. This “Lecture Translator” has been used in the lecture halls of KIT since 2012. “Recognition of spontaneous speech is the most important component of this system,” Waibel explains, “as errors and delays in recognition make the translation incomprehensible. On conversational speech, the human error rate amounts to about 5.5%. Our system now reaches 5.0%.” Apart from precision, however, the speed of the system to produce output is just as important so students can follow the lecture live. The researchers have now succeeded in reducing this latency to one second. This is the smallest reported latency reached by a speech recognition system of this quality to date, says Waibel.</p><p>Error rate and latency are measured using the standardized and internationally recognized, scientific “switchboard-benchmark” test. This benchmark (defined by US NIST) is widely used by international AI researchers in their competition to build a machine that comes close to humans in recognizing spontaneous speech under comparable conditions, or even outperforming them.</p><p>According to Waibel, fast, high accuracy speech recognition is an essential step for further downstream processing. It enables dialog, translation, and other AI modules to provide better voice based interaction with machines.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kit.edu%2Fkit%2Fenglish%2Fpi_2020_095_ai-outperforms-humans-in-speech-recognition.php&amp;t=MzliYWQxMGE3YmZkMTNiMzYwZjhlM2Y1NDk0NmRmMTUyZmRmNGUwNixmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603502155">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b> “Super-Human Performance in Online Low-latency Recognition of Conversational Speech”,&nbsp;ArXiv.org.<br></p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2010.03449&amp;t=MjZiNmJkMDEzMjQ0YTlhNjA4ZjA2ZDJlZmFmODU0NTczOGZlMjliOSxmdzZjV1ZDWQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F632549413910396928%2Fai-surpasses-humans-in-speech-recognition&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1603502155">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03449</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/632109737244311552/nuance-va-speech-recognition">VA expands telehealth services with speech recognition cloud platform</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago I added <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-clarifies-jamstack-remarks#comment-344626">this comment in WPTavern</a>, on an article where WordPress founder's Matt Mullenweg clarifies his earlier remarks that the Jamstack is "a regression for the vast majority of the people adopting it".</p><p>Since I like owing my own content, I reproduce it here in my own blog.</p><hr><p>I think Matt’s brutal honesty is welcome, because most information out there about the Jamstack praises it. However, it also comes from developers using these modern new tools, evaluating their own convenience and satisfaction. As Matt points out, that doesn’t mean it makes it easier for the end user to use the software, which is what WordPress is good at.</p><p>I actually like the Jamstack, but because of how complex it is, it’s rather limiting, even to support some otherwise basic functionality.</p><p>The definitive example is comments, which should be at the core websites building communities. WordPress is extremely good at supporting comments in the site. The Jamstack is sooooo bad at it. In all these many years, nobody has been able to solve comments for the Jamstack, which for me evidences that it is inherently unsuitable to support this feature.</p><p>All attempts so far have been workarounds, not solutions. Eg:</p><ul><li>Netlify forms: no hierarchy, so can post a comment but not a response (unless adding some meta to the comment body? how ugly is that?)</li><li>Storing comments in a GitHub repo: it takes a long time to merge the PR with the comment</li></ul><p>Also, all these solutions are overtly complicated. Do I need to set-up a webhook to trigger a new build just to add a comment? And then, maybe cache the new comment in the client’s LocalStorage for if the user refreshes the page immediately, before the new build is finished? Seriously?</p><p>And then, they don’t provide the killer feature: to send notifications of the new comment to all parties involved in the discussion. That’s how communities get built, and websites become successful. Speed is a factor. But more important than speed, it is dynamic functionality to support communities. The website may look fancy, but it may well become a ghost town.</p><p>(Btw, as an exercise, you can research which websites started as WordPress and then migrated to the Jamstack, and check how many comments they had then vs now… the numbers will, most likely, be waaaaaaay down)</p><p>Another way is to not pre-render the comments, but render them dynamically after fetching it with an API. Yes, this solution works, but then you still have WordPress (or some other CMS) in the back-end to store the comments :P</p><p>The final option is to use 3rd parties such as Disqus to handle this functionality for you. Then, I will be sharing my users’ data with the 3rd party, and they may use it who knows how, and for the benefit of who (most likely, not my users’). Since I care about privacy, that’s a big no for me.</p><p>As a result, my own blog, which is a Jamstack site, doesn’t support comments! What do I do if I want feedback on a blog post? I add a link to a corresponding tweet, asking to add a comment there. I myself feel ashamed at this compromise, but given my site’s stack, I don’t see how I can solve it.</p><p>I still like my blog as a Jamstack, though, because it’s fast, it’s free, and I create all the blog posts in Markdown using VSCode. But I can’t create a community! So, as Matt says, there are things the Jamstack can handle. But certainly not everything. And possibly, not the one(s) that enable your your website to become successful.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Network programming is something that can be tricky in every programming language. Fortunately all network programming makes use of BSD sockets, a paradigm that almost universal in all modern operating systems and programming languages.</p><p>In this article, I'll show you how you can program sockets in Lisp using the SBCL implementation. You see, the Common Lisp specification has no specification for socket programming. So every Lisp compiler is free to specify it's own implementation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a first version of this article and only focusses on writing a Lisp server. I'll update this article later to include a Lisp client.</p><div id="general-flow-for-sockets">
<h2>General flow for sockets</h2>
<p>All systems making use of network sockets follow a similar flow. The flow does differ between client and server implementations.</p>
<p>The first step is to <strong>create a socket</strong> and set the desired <strong>socket options</strong>. Next you have to <strong>bind</strong> the socket to a specific address. An <em>address</em> in socket programming is a combination of an IP address and a port number. After the socket is bound to an address, the server can listen to incoming connections of clients.</p>
</div><div id="writing-a-lisp-server">
<h2>Writing a Lisp server</h2>
<p>Let's start by writing a simple server in Lisp. Note that this code won't work just yet, follow along.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>#(</span><span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span>
<span>(</span><span>defparameter</span> <span>*port*</span> <span>8080</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket</span> <span>:type</span> <span>:stream</span> <span>:protocol</span> <span>:tcp</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

        <span>; Bind to an address</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-bind</span> <span>server</span> <span>*address*</span> <span>*port*</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-listen</span> <span>server</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>First we define two parameters, <strong>address</strong> and <strong>port</strong>. The <strong>address</strong> parameter is a vector respresenting the <em>IP address 0.0.0.0</em>. The <strong>port</strong> parameter is the integer 8080. Binding our socket to this address will let it listen on all IP addresses of the computer we run this program on.</p>
<p>In the <em>start-server</em> function we first create a socket by creating an instance of <em>inet-socket</em>. Next we set the options and then bind it to the address. Finally we start listening on the socket.</p>
<p>Next we have to accept any client connections and handle those connections. For our example we will create a server that will echo everything a client sends and then close the connection.</p>
<p>Let's update our <em>start-server</em> function to accept connections and pass the connection to a handler function. To make reading from the socket a bit easier, I've added a helper function <em>read-from-connection</em>.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>start-server</span> <span>()</span>
    <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>server</span> <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'sb-bsd-sockets:inet-socket</span> <span>:type</span> <span>:stream</span> <span>:protocol</span> <span>:tcp</span><span>)))</span>
        <span>; Set socket options</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:sockopt-reuse-address</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:non-blocking-mode</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>t</span><span>)</span>

                 <span>(</span><span>subseq</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>0</span> <span>length</span><span>)</span>
                 <span>data</span><span>))))</span>

 <span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>

         <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-send</span> <span>connection</span> <span>data</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
         <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see we had to do some processing of the data received from the socket. Our function <em>read-from-connection</em> reads up to 1024 bytes from the connection. Lisp has to <em>allocate</em> an entire buffer of that length, but only a certain number of bytes are received. So we simple return the part of the buffer equal to the length of the data written.</p>
<p>In the <em>handle-connection</em> function, we read data from the connection using our helper function. Then we simply send that data back to the connection by using the <strong>socket-send</strong> function, and finally close our socket by making use of the <strong>socket-close</strong> function.</p>
<p>To connect to our server you can use the telnet command on your computer:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>michael@winston:~<span>|</span>⇒  telnet <span>127</span>.0.0.1 <span>9000</span>
Trying <span>127</span>.0.0.1...
Connected to <span>127</span>.0.0.1.
Escape character is <span>'^]'</span>.
Lisp is amazing!
Lisp is amazing!
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see the telnet commands establishes a connection. We then enter something ("Lisp is amazing!" in my example) and press enter. The server immediately echos back what we sent it and closes the connection.</p>
<p>The complete example up untill now can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">simple echo server</a> file.</p>
<div id="handling-multiple-client-connections">
<h3>Handling multiple client connections</h3>
<p>Our design has one important flaw. Because of the way our server handles connections, only one connection can be handled by our server at a time.</p>
<p>You can test this out by connecting two telnet sessions to our server, just connect but don't send anything just yet. If you send a string to our server on the second telnet session, you won't get an immediate reply. The connection will stay open, without a response, untill the first session is finished. Send something through the first telnet session and you'll notice the second session will get a response and close after the first session does.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the flow of our server, you'll see that our loop that accepts connections is 'kept busy' by our <em>handle-connection</em> function. We can't accept new connections while our <em>handle-connection</em> function hasn't finished. In this particular case, the impact is negligible: since we simple read, send and then close the connection we will quickly return to the loop accepting connections. But image if our connection handler would keep the connection alive and read multiple times from a connection? Bad design!</p>
<p>Luckily, we can easily fix this by starting a new thread for each connection and handle the connection in the new thread.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>handle-connection</span> <span>(</span><span>connection</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>sb-thread:make-thread</span>
        <span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>; Handle our connection in this lambda, which is run in a new thread</span>
            <span>(</span><span>loop</span>
                <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>data</span> <span>(</span><span>read-from-connection</span> <span>connection</span><span>)))</span>
                    <span>; Do something with the data received</span>
                    <span>))</span>
            <span>(</span><span>sb-bsd-sockets:socket-close</span> <span>connection</span><span>))))</span>
</pre></div>
<p>We changed our <em>handle-connection</em> function to make a new thread. That thread will spin off from the main server thread and continue on its own. While the thread is running it's own loop in this case, the server is free to accept new connections that will be handled by threads of their own.</p>
<p>If you test our server with two telnet session like we did before, you'll notice our server now responds as expected. The fact that one client was connected first, but hasn't finished yet, makes no difference when handling a second client.</p>
<p>The full example can be found in the <a href="https://sinax.be/code/echo-server-threaded.lisp">threaded echo server</a> file.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><code><span>io_uring</span></code> is a new asynchronous I/O API for Linux created by Jens Axboe from Facebook. It aims at providing an API without the limitations of the current <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> family of system calls, which we discussed in the previous section. Given that users of asynchronous programming models choose it in the first place for performance reasons, it makes sense to have an API that has very low performance overheads. We shall see how <code><span>io_uring</span></code> achieves this in subsequent sections.</p><div id="the-io-uring-interface">
<h2>The io_uring interface<a href="#the-io-uring-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The very name io_uring comes from the fact that the interfaces uses ring buffers as the main interface for kernel-user space communication. While there are system calls involved, they are kept to a minimum and there is a polling mode you can use to reduce the need to make system calls as much as possible.</p>

<div id="the-mental-model">
<h3>The mental model<a href="#the-mental-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The mental model you need to construct in order to use <code><span>io_uring</span></code> to build programs that process I/O asynchronously is fairly simple.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are 2 ring buffers, one for submission of requests (submission queue or SQ) and the other that informs you about completion of those requests (completion queue or CQ).</p></li>
<li><p>These ring buffers are shared between kernel and user space. You set these up with <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_setup.html#c.io_uring_setup" title="io_uring_setup"><code><span>io_uring_setup()</span></code></a> and then mapping them into user space with 2 <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> calls.</p></li>
<li><p>You tell io_uring what you need to get done (read or write a file, accept client connections, etc), which you describe as part of a submission queue entry (SQE) and add it to the tail of the submission ring buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>You then tell the kernel via the <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> system call that you’ve added an SQE to the submission queue ring buffer. You can add multiple SQEs before making the system call as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Optionally, <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> can also wait for a number of requests to be processed by the kernel before it returns so you know you’re ready to read off the completion queue for results.</p></li>
<li><p>The kernel processes requests submitted and adds completion queue events (CQEs) to the tail of the completion queue ring buffer.</p></li>
<li><p>You read CQEs off the head of the completion queue ring buffer. There is one CQE corresponding to each SQE and it contains the status of that particular request.</p></li>
<li><p>You continue adding SQEs and reaping CQEs as you need.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/tutorial/sq_poll.html#sq-poll"><span>polling mode available</span></a>, in which the kernel polls for new entries in the submission queue. This avoids the system call overhead of calling <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> every time you submit entries for processing.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
</div><div id="io-uring-performance">
<h2>io_uring performance<a href="#io-uring-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Because of the shared ring buffers between the kernel and user space, io_uring can be a zero-copy system. Copying bytes around becomes necessary when system calls that transfer data between kernel and user space are involved. But since the bulk of the communication in <code><span>io_uring</span></code> is via buffers shared between the kernel and user space, this huge performance overhead is completely avoided. While system calls (and we’re used to making them a lot) may not seem like a significant overhead, in high performance applications, making a lot of them will begin to matter. Also, system calls are not as cheap as they used to be. Throw in workarounds the operating system has in place to deal with <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Specter and Meltdown</a>, we are talking non-trivial overheads. So, avoiding system calls as much as possible is a fantastic idea in high-performance applications indeed.</p>
<p>While using synchronous programming interfaces or even when using asynchronous programming interfaces under Linux, there is at least one system call involved in the submission of each request. In <code><span>io_uring</span></code>, you can add several requests, simply by adding multiple SQEs each describing the I/O operation you want and make a single call to io_uring_enter. For starers, that’s a win right there. But it gets better.</p>
<p>You can have the kernel poll and pick up your SQEs for processing as you add them to the submission queue. This avoids the <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-iouring/io_uring_enter.html#c.io_uring_enter" title="io_uring_enter"><code><span>io_uring_enter()</span></code></a> call you need to make to tell the kernel to pick up SQEs. For high-performance applications, this means even lesser system call overheads. See <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/tutorial/sq_poll.html#sq-poll"><span>the submission queue polling tutorial</span></a> for more details.</p>
<p>With some clever use of shared ring buffers, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> performance is really memory-bound, since in polling mode, we can do away with system calls altogether. It is important to remember that performance benchmarking is a relative process with some kind of a common point of reference. According to the <a href="https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf">io_uring paper</a>, on a reference machine, in polling mode, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> managed to clock 1.7M 4k IOPS, while <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> manages 608k. Although much more than double, this isn’t a fair comparison since <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a> doesn’t feature a polled mode. But even when polled mode is disabled, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> hits 1.2M IOPS, close to double that of <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html">aio(7)</a>.</p>
<p>To check the raw throughput of the <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface, there is a no-op request type. With this, on the reference machine, <code><span>io_uring</span></code> achieves 20M messages per second. See <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/ref-liburing/submission.html#c.io_uring_prep_nop" title="io_uring_prep_nop"><code><span>io_uring_prep_nop()</span></code></a> for more details.</p>

<h2>An example using the low-level API<a href="#an-example-using-the-low-level-api" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Writing a small program that reads files and prints them on to the console, like how the Unix <code><span>cat</span></code> utility does might be a good starting point to get your hands wet with the <code><span>io_uring</span></code> API. Please see the next chapter for one such example.</p>
</div><div id="just-use-liburing">
<h2>Just use liburing<a href="#just-use-liburing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While being acquainted with the low-level <code><span>io_uring</span></code> API is most certainly a good thing, in real, serious programs you probably want to use the higher-level interface provided by liburing. Programs like <a href="https://qemu.org/">QEMU</a> already use it. If liburing never existed, you’d have built some abstraction layer over the low-lever <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface. liburing does that for you and it is a well thought-out interface as well. In short, you should probably put in some effort to understand how the low-level <code><span>io_uring</span></code> interface works, but by default you should really be using <code><span>liburing</span></code> in your programs.</p>
<p>While there is a reference section here for it, there are some examples based on <code><span>liburing</span></code> we’ll see in the subsequent chapters.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL has become a widely adopted standard over the past few years. However, not everyone is taking advantage of the full capabilities of the standard. In this article, I’ll demonstrate methods for creating more expressive schemas that better fit your data needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s start by defining an example scenario. We’re building a forum application, which will have several types of users:</p><ul role="list"><li>Standard users that post and read content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Moderators that oversee forum postings and police activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Administrators that manage the operations of the forum. For example, dealing with technical issues, assigning moderators, and more.</li></ul><p>What might a schema for such a site look like? Let’s start off with a barebones schema. This example will be using a Node Express and GraphQL project. I’ll assume you already know how to do that, but I will include the entire project code at the bottom of the article later. Create a typeDefs.ts file like this. Notice that we’re using TypeScript, since the type annotations help make the code more clear.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>

const typeDefs = gql` 
  type StandardUser { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
 
export default typeDefs; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>You’ll notice that we have the three user types, and an additional type called Category, which represents the group that our posts will go into. However it’s clear there is repetition across our fields (e.g. id, username). It’s in fact possible to pull out a “base type” from each of the three user related types. Let’s attempt to do this by updating this schema using Interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Interfaces&nbsp;</h3><p>An interface is just a skeleton of sorts. It’s a contract that declares rules, in this case specific fields, however it has no implementation and therefore cannot return data. Only types can. However since it does provide structure, we are using Interfaces to define base fields and then have our types implement those Interfaces. For example, if we update our typeDefs with Interfaces it could look like this.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
const typeDefs = gql` 
  interface Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
  } 
 
  interface User implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  interface Rating { 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type StandardUser implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
  } 
 
  type Moderator implements Identifiable &amp; User &amp; Rating { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
    stars: Int! 
    categories: [Category!] 
  } 
 
  type Administrator implements Identifiable &amp; User { 
    id: ID! 
    userName: String! 
  } 
 
  type Category implements Identifiable { 
    id: ID! 
    name: String! 
  } 
`; 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>If we start at the top, you’ll see our first interface is called Identifiable. Since all of the entities in our data model have a unique ID, this interface will be the base for all of our entities. Next, we see that the User interface implements the Identifiable interface. Notice how User has both the id field and its own field called userName. When a type or interface implements an interface, they must implement all of its fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Next up we have another interface called Rating. Since two of our types StandardUser and Moderator use the stars field, but Administrator does not, we have this interface so that only the types that use the stars field can implement it – otherwise, the User models can skip it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, we finally have our actual types StandardUser, Moderator, and Administrator, where each one implements only the interfaces it needs by using an &amp; symbol to denote more than one interface being implemented. Then lastly the Category type.&nbsp;</p><p>So, as you can see this set of types and hierarchies is quite reminiscent of most modern programming languages, for example TypeScript.</p><p>We now have a reasonable schema model. Let’s try querying it. Update the typeDefs variable by adding this Query.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
type Query { 
    getAllUsers: [User!] 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>As you can see, we’ve added a function that retrieves all of our site’s users, but returns them as an array of Users. Let’s now write our resolver and see if this will work. First create your resolver file like the following:</p><div><pre><code>
import { IResolvers } from "apollo-server-express"; 
import { getAllUsers, User } from "../dataService"; 
import { GqlContext } from "./GqlContext"; 
 
const resolvers: IResolvers = { 
  Query: { 
    getAllUsers: async ( 
      parent, 
      args: null, 
      ctx: GqlContext, 
      info: any 
	): Promise<array<user>&gt; =&gt; { 
      return getAllUsers(); 
	}, 
  }, 
}; 
 
export default resolvers; 
</array<user></code>
</pre></div><p>Our resolver’s only action is to call our getAllUsers function in order to retrieve the actual data. You’ll notice that our getAllUsers resolver is returning an array of User Interfaces. This should be a bit suspicious, but for now let’s just see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p>Now we must implement the getAllUsers function in code. But to make this article simpler and focus on GraphQL we’ll create a function that returns hard coded values. Create a file called dataService.ts and add this code.</p><div><pre><code>
import { v4 } from "uuid"; 
 
export interface Identifiable { 
  id: string; 
} 
 
export interface User extends Identifiable { 
  userName: string; 
} 
 
export interface Rating { 
  stars: number; 
} 
 
export class StandardUser implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Moderator implements User { 
  constructor( 
    public id: string, 
    public userName: string, 
    public stars: number, 
    public categories: [Category] 
  ) {} 
} 
 
export class Administrator implements User { 
  constructor(public id: string, public userName: string) {} 
} 
 
export class Category implements Identifiable { 
  constructor(public id: string, public name: string) {} 
} 
 
export function getAllUsers() { 
  const users: Array<user> = []; 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "dave", 4)); 
  users.push(new Moderator(v4(), "ruth", 5, [new Category(v4(), "Cooking")])); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "jane", 5)); 
  users.push(new StandardUser(v4(), "tom", 1)); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "linda")); 
  users.push( 
    new Moderator(v4(), "tom", 2, [new Category(v4(), "Programming")]) 
  ); 
  users.push(new Administrator(v4(), "betty")); 
 
  return users; 
} 
</user></code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>Our dataService contains all of our TypeScript types that mirror our GraphQL schemas, as well as the getAllUsers function that returns a list of objects that inherit from our User Interface. As you can see, getAllUsers all types of Users, including StandardUsers and Administrators, but since they all implement the User interface (i.e. User is the parent type for all of them), the function’s return type is set as an array of User types. Now let’s try querying it!</p><h3>Querying and Fragments</h3><p>Open your GraphQL playground by opening your browser to the GraphQL server URL, which would be something like http://localhost:&lt;port number&gt;/graphql. Then add this Query as shown.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
query { 
    getAllUsers { 
  	... on User { 
        id 
        userName 
  	} 
	} 
} 
</code>
</pre></div><p>‍</p><p>This is our Query for getAllUsers, but instead of fields we see three periods. What we’re seeing with the “…” is called an inline Fragment. This tells the GraphQL service which type of data we are looking for. In this case we indicate that we want the Interface User and its fields of id and userName.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s try and run this Query, but when we do we get this error shown.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-b158e79301e4-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def7201d623778ea438_PIIAWDJ_AhMP0A-vvcjwUNoHCg_WvzU_ih_MejA2hzeijfi7RI3lHvNq5pXadUM2JbGzIVoT0Ny2XqAveRkYRh7ow7xWHMnBfFIIkg6g0iXm9uHKclOT1FdRUyMomCxlR0xJr80.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.6 First query error&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>What does this error mean? If we look back at our definition of GraphQL Interfaces we said they only have declarations, but no implementations. Therefore, we need to replace the interface with an implementation of the interface, the type, that does return data. Let’s see how to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Update the resolvers variable by adding this code.&nbsp;</p><div><pre><code>
User: { 
    __resolveType(obj: any, ctx: GqlContext, info: any) { 
      if (obj.categories) { 
        return "Moderator"; 
  	} else if (obj.stars) { 
        return "StandardUser"; 
  	} 
 
      return "Administrator"; 
	}, 
  }, 
</code>
</pre></div><p>By defining the User Interface in our resolvers we are telling GraphQL that when it encounters the User in a Query it should instead return one of the specific types listed. Note, the logic of how to go about determining this is entirely up to you. However an obvious potential way of doing this would be to use member fields unique to each type, as we have done here.&nbsp;</p><p>So now when we run the same Query again we get this.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-2d373c8cffc7-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2defabcf9fda1c9bfe3c_ftxvQYJCQ3OAPpkHSZnuVL7jXMEfunX-V0p_R8ZSuXgZ2rx7WK4QzdCqH_eZJ34YFMjBO9kNz9SXa7ndzlfLx5ryJ9CAzIz7P4q-660SjiLv9BQ8pImbQkcNQtw5-0nk45evL9M.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.8 Second query updated attempt&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Clearly this works, but we’re not getting all the related fields and it’s hard to tell which type each returned item is. Let’s update our query a bit to show these details.&nbsp;</p><figure id="w-node-f491df54febb-f078b551"><p><img alt="Graphical user interface, text, applicationDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def420f9a0f6c80d8c8_2SHnrjaNjXyK0u6aUR7Hz8ljFO-tgQzGVFWgEpOiM6fdGPwDDLHO06pfgwfzBt53FVEvjGY-cIqhfwt8oO3AqgfyNT2gShd68HhW-XkaXgbZ_pA-ZqG1-S4XklcIbrqENkCmbH4.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.9 Updated Query</figcaption></figure><p>If we go over this Query, we can see that by using the __typename field we get back the type name of every item in our result set. So that definitely helps clarify things somewhat. However only the StandardUser type is returning actual fields. The other types are indicated, but their type-specific data is blank! It’s clear what we need to do so let’s take a stab at it.</p><figure id="w-node-56558d760f7a-f078b551"><p><img alt="TextDescription automatically generated" src="https://assets.website-files.com/5ec5ad145468d2d2ff78b364/5f8f2def278d58389665c636_mXZsK_WO2ymnwnCq5GMq2xctdvRhmQ3JdCo_QBrHR_K2ldFKc5T4cKUkP_eqioXJWYxdqIMN3Dlv5eECYPpgN_rxwzOJRIZLS3Pe18d353X1DuYVtKamXiEoJp1q9DbJmbY37gE.png"></p><figcaption>Figure 1.10 Updated Query with all types&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As you probably guessed, we needed to add our other types and their specific fields. For example, in the case of Moderator we have a unique field called categories, Since the category is its own type as well, we also specified the “name” member from the type.</p><p>Now we’ve got everything working! Alas, there’s one small issue. Even after implementing such robust types, we’re still repeating the id and userName fields multiple times. In this case, it doesn’t matter much. But for larger data models, it’s quite easy to have dozens of shared fields – imagine specific all those fields repeatedly!</p><p>We’ve already seen how we can use inline …</p></div></div>

                <p>We’re uncovering the Armory Agent for Kubernetes: a more flexible, scalable, and secure way for Spinnaker to interact with your Kubernetes infrastructure.</p>

<p>Spinnaker monitors your Kubernetes infrastructure constantly so it can display the infrastructure to users, know how to version your services, and more. Spinnaker reaches out to each cluster, retrieves all the Kubernetes objects it is configured to, computes various relationships, and stores the result in its cache.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="347" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-1024x463.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-360x163.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Current-Spinnaker-768x347.png"></p>
<p>While powerful, this unobtrusive discovery mechanism has given rise two types of issues when handling a larger number (100s or 1000s) of Kubernetes clusters: <strong>performance and account management</strong>.</p>
<h2>Caching Performance</h2>
<p>With a large number of clusters, performance can be degraded as the same data is retrieved over and over – even when nothing has changed. Spinnaker repeats the process for each cluster and each namespace<sup>1</sup>. The Agent takes a different approach, listening to changes at the cluster level and streaming them back to Spinnaker. Changes to your infrastructure – whether Spinnaker initiated or not – show up in “real time” in Spinnaker’s cache, all over a single TCP connection per cluster.</p>
<h2>Using the Cache</h2>
<p>The Agent also comes with an optimized storage that allows some nice performance improvements – made possible by adopting Kubernetes and RDBMS-specific storage.</p>
<p>Below are some examples we saw during the development of the agent:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png" alt="" width="768" height="663" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-360x311.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics.png 912w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/agent-cache-metrics-768x663.png"></p>
<h2>Account Management</h2>
<p>In its <a href="#agent-mode">Agent mode</a>, the Agent simplifies Kubernetes account management within Spinnaker. Instead of a centralized account management model, where all of your Kubernetes service accounts and credentials are stored within Spinnaker, the Agent sits within each Kubernetes cluster and manages accounts from there. This enables individual teams to manage credentials and permissions for their respective clusters, and allows you to add or delete new accounts on the fly without restarting Spinnaker.</p>
<h2>Added Bonus: Enhanced Security</h2>
<p>The Agent provides an added bonus by enhancing security. It allows you to keep your Kubernetes API servers private from Spinnaker, and restricts the information leaving the cluster to only what Spinnaker needs to operate. Individual teams can also easily rotate or remove Kubernetes configs as needed.</p>


<p>The Agent acts as Spinnaker’s gateway to Kubernetes. It comes in two parts: a lightweight Golang program that gives you a lot of deployment flexibility – we’ll get back to that shortly – and a plugin to Spinnaker. Let’s set it up in our Spinnaker installation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" data-src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png" alt="" width="768" height="347" srcset="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png 768w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-1024x463.png 1024w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-360x163.png 360w, https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" src="https://www.armory.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/In-cluster-agent-768x347.png"></p>
<p>Installing the Agent is straightforward, especially if you already use the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/installation/operator/">Spinnaker Operator</a>. Follow the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-agent/armory-agent-quick/">quick start</a>, and deploy:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plugin to Clouddriver: this will be what the Agent will connect to. A new (gRPC) port will be open.</li>
<li>a <code>Service</code> that points to Clouddriver’s gRPC port.</li>
<li>a <code>Deployment</code> of the Agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above configuration, you’d just define accounts in the Agent – not in Clouddriver anymore. With a simple bit of yaml, a HELM chart, or a kustomize template, teams can inject the Agent&nbsp; into newly provisioned Kubernetes clusters and immediately make them a software deployment targets. Like other parts of Spinnaker, the Agent fully implements secret management so you can store your <code>kubeconfig</code> files in one of the <a href="https://docs.armory.io/docs/armory-admin/secrets/#supported-secret-engines">supported secret engines</a> or just provision them via the method of your choice as Kubernetes secrets.</p>
<p>The Agent will also detect configuration changes and reload the list of accounts immediately. So we could keep updating agent accounts in a separate <code>configMap</code>.<br>
<a name="agent-mode"></a></p>

<p>The great thing with cloud providers – or with a dose of infrastructure automation – is that it’s easy to spin up new Kubernetes clusters. We see application teams more and more in charge of their own infrastructure. In this context, deploying with Spinnaker often becomes a game of cat and mouse to get your cluster information into the hands of the ops team.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a lot of tooling developed over the years. What if we could skip that step? Behold! That’s why it’s called Armory Agent for Kubernetes</p>

<p>In this mode, the Agent is installed in the deployment target cluster by the provisioning tool (e.g. Terraform) – alongside your monitoring and logging infrastructure – or separately via scripts.</p>
<p>The Agent is also configured with Spinnaker’s endpoint and the proper authentication (mTLS, JWT, …). When it starts, it will register to Spinnaker and the account will automatically be available for caching and deployment.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the cluster is deleted – or if you just uninstall the Agent, the account will be removed from Spinnaker after a grace period.</p>

<p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention <a href="https://www.armory.io/armory-cloud/">Armory Cloud</a>, Armory’s new SaaS offering. It is a big reason we doubled down on the Agent. With the Agent and the model above, Armory can help you deploy to your infrastructure (public or private), does not need any credentials, and can be revoked at anytime by customers.</p>
<p>A different strategy is to manage groups of clusters. This can be useful in an environment where the control plane does not have direct access to your cluster but cluster information is still centralized. But it can also be helpful to group clusters geographically close, belonging to the same business unit, or with a similar network topology.</p>

<p>The Agent is currently in Early Release and is being used by select Armory customers. We’re encouraged with our early results and are iterating quickly. The Agent is compatible with Armory Spinnaker as well as open source Spinnaker, so please <a href="https://www.armory.io/contact-us/">reach out</a> if you want to take it for a spin. Also, join us for a <a href="https://spinnakersummit2020.sched.com/event/fND7"><span>lunch &amp; learn</span></a><span> about the Agent on 11/4 during the </span><a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/spinnaker-summit/"><span>Spinnaker Summit and Gardening Days.</span></a></p>
<p><em>Footnotes:</em></p>
<p><em>1. Fortunately, Spinnaker is highly instrumented and if you know what metrics to watch for, there is surely a knob to turn to correct it. Note that there is an effort currently underway to improve the situation and we expect Spinnaker caching performance to greatly improve over the next few releases!</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>It is very common that we want to compute an integral for some $f(x)$ defined in $\Omega$.</p><p>

\[I = \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx\]

</p><p>However, in some circumstances, the analytical result of the expected value might not be derived easily if $f(x)$ is very complex.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss how to compute an integral approximately using Monte Carlo integration.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="law-of-large-numbers">Law of Large Numbers</h4>

<p>Law of large numbers states that for random variable $X$ with $\mathbb{E}[X] = \mu$ and $\mathbb{Var}[X] = \sigma^2$ and we also have a sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)</a> random variables $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, the sample average random variable</p><p>

\[\overline{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\]

</p><p>converges to $\mu$</p><p>

\[\overline{X}_{n} \rightarrow \mu, \text{ when } n \rightarrow \infty\]

</p><p>This means that for any random variable, if the number of random samples is sufficiently large, the average of random samples from the i.i.d random variables will be sure to be the population mean $\mu$.</p>



<p>This is quite similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a>, except that the law of large numbers did not tell the distribution of sample average random variable will become a Gaussian distribution as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</p>



<p>Therefore, to estimate $\mathbb{E}[X]$, we prepare $n$ random samples $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ from i.i.d random variables $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, and $n$ is sufficiently large.</p><p>

\[\mathbb{E}[X] \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\]

</p><h3 id="riemann-integral-and-riemann-sum">Riemann Integral and Riemann Sum</h3>

<h4 id="riemann-integral">Riemann Integral</h4>

<p>Riemann integral is actually the definition of the definite integral.</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx = \lim_{||\Delta x|| \rightarrow 0}^{} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^{\ast}) \Delta x_i\]

</p><p>where $\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $x_i^{\ast} \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$.</p>

<h4 id="riemann-sum">Riemann Sum</h4>

<p>Following Riemann integral, Riemann sum provides a way to compute the definite integral approximately.</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^{\ast}) \Delta x_i\]

</p><p>where $\Delta x_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$ and $x_i^{\ast} \in [x_{i-1}, x_i]$.</p>



<p>As a special case of Riemann sum, suppose the volume of $\Omega$ is $V$, where</p><p>

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>We evenly divided the area $\Omega$ into $n$ pieces to get all the $x_i$, then $\Delta x_i = \frac{V}{n}$. We further set $x_i^{\ast} = x_i$. We have the Riemann sum</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \frac{V}{n} \\
&amp;= \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The advantage of Monte Carlo integration over Riemann sum is that for some $\Omega$ it is easier to do random sampling in $\Omega$ than evenly diving $\Omega$.</p>

<h3 id="monte-carlo-integration">Monte Carlo Integration</h3>

<p>Monte Carlo integration is somewhat similar to Riemann sum. However, instead of evenly dividing the area $\Omega$ into $n$ pieces to get all the $x_i$, we randomly sample $x_i$ from $\Omega$. The expression of the formula remains almost the same as the special case of Riemann sum we discussed above though.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where</p><p>

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>and $x_i$ is a random sample of $X_i$ which is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)</a> random variables defined in $\Omega$ that follows <strong>uniform</strong> distribution.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p>



<p>By definition, we have the expected value for an arbitrary function.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[f(X)] &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} p(x) f(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

\[V = \int_{\Omega}^{} dx\]

</p><p>We set $p(x) = \frac{1}{V}$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[f(X)] &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} p(x) f(x) dx \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} \frac{1}{V} f(x) dx \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{V} \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx = V \mathbb{E}[f(X)]\]

</p><p>According to the law of large numbers, since $f(X)$ is a random variable, $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ could be computed approximately by sampling. That is to say, we have $n$ i.i.d random variables, $f(X_1), f(X_2), \cdots, f(X_n)$, and we randomly sample $f(x_1), f(x_2), \cdots, f(x_n)$ for $f(X_1), f(X_2), \cdots, f(X_n)$, respectively. To do such sampling for $f(X_i)$, we sample $x_i$ for $X_i$ uniformly from $\Omega$, following by computing $f(x_i)$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;= V \mathbb{E}[f(X)] \\
&amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<p>Here we would take a look at the applications of Monte Carlo integration.</p>

<h4 id="compute-pi-approximately">Compute $\pi$ Approximately</h4>

<p>To be honest, I have totally forgotten how $\pi$ is formally computed. However, with some prior knowledge about $\pi$ and circle, we could compute $\pi$ approximately.</p>



<p>We define a circle whose center is located at $(0,0)$ with a radius of $r = 1$. Formally, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. With our prior knowledge, we know the area of this circle is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
S &amp;= \pi r^2 \\
&amp;= \pi
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore, to compute $\pi$ approximately, we just have to compute the area of the circle approximately.</p>



<p>We define $\Omega = [-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]$ and a function $f(x, y)$ defined in $\Omega$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(x, y) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{if $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{else}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
I &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x, y) dx dy \\
&amp;= S \times 1 \\
&amp;= S \\
&amp;= \pi \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that the integral $I$ is actually the volume of a cylinder which equals to $\pi$, instead of the area of the circle.</p>



<p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\pi = \int_{\Omega}^{} f(x, y) dx dy\]

</p><p>To compute the integral approximately, we could either use Riemann sum or Monte Carlo integration. Here we use Monte Carlo integration to compute the integral.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
V &amp;= \int_{\Omega}^{} dx dy \\
&amp;= 4
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega}^{} f(x) dx &amp;\approx \frac{V}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could then write a compute program to help us finish the following sampling tasks.</p>

<p><span>When Yang made the announcement people were stunned. The Cato Institute slipped their children cyanide pills. Held their hands while they convulsed and foamed and slipped mercifully into the night. Chelsea Handler set herself on fire. Even the channers couldn’t believe it– and it was them who’d made it happen. But I signed up the next day. It was like my prayers were heard.</span><span id="more-6287"></span></p>
<p><span>Incel had taken out Amazon. Not the whole thing at once– but they’d figured out that you could get an RC chopper at the hobby store. A pack of model rocket engines. Ten Incel fedayeen could blow up transformers next to <i>Fulfillment Centers</i> any given day and that was that. Hundreds of millions vanished. Workers evacuated but still paid as Bezos’ fingers clenched futilely around that precious seven dollars an hour slipping away. And, importantly, no <i>Value Added. </i>No tax collected on every robot delivered package. Every self-driving truck mile. Google and Facebook didn’t even need a bomb. They were ad sales operations. Someone found their real data, sent it to their clients. No tax on every click. Zuckerberg retired to his acreage in Hawaii to live out his days diving. He’d caught the business end of a Portuguese man o’ war. Priscilla had made it through med school. But appearing distraught was the hardest thing she’d ever done.</span></p>
<p><span>For the first time in history, the unlaid were organized. People had had Freedom Dividends six months. Now taking it away meant murder. And there, one day, on Jack Dorsey’s hacked Twitter after an introductory FUCK N*GGERS, was a <i>list of demands. </i>It was one item long.</span></p>
<p><span><i>We want GFs</i></span></p>
<p><span>Yang caved. I was 45. My mother had stopped asking about girlfriends. Then about pets. Then about anything but suicidal ideation. I’d voted for Yang. Donated. Even though his signs needled me at night. <i>DO THE MATH</i>. Ever increasing odds of my middle aged sperm causing autism. The math said I’d grow old and die. Never hold my first child. Or I’d spend my days fighting him off as he bit me savagely for moving his oscillating fan. My own fault. Sometimes I’d think of her<i>. </i>Maybe text. Thinking I shouldn’t have let go. She’d text back. I remembered why I did.</span></p>
<p><span>The system was National E-Harmony. You punched in stats about yourself. It found you one match, one time. <i>Math</i>. A woman who dated her match two years could quintuple her Freedom Dividend. <i>It’s national sex trafficking,</i> said Rachel Maddow, rasping like male hope was cutting off her air. It didn’t matter. Cable news viewers averaged 78 years old. By the next election they’d be dead.</span></p>
<p><span>You punched in stats and she did too and the system gave her your address and one morning the doorbell rang.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>Hi, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>Hi.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m Jocelyn.</span></p>
<p><span>She looked Irish. That was the first problem. Under 38, over 32. I don’t want to fuck her, I thought. I specifically said Asian. But no, fucking isn’t the point here. Do you want to come in.</span></p>
<p><span>I’d rather not, until we know each other.</span></p>
<p><span>Jesus Christ is she rejecting me already. 5 grand a month not enough to get a woman in my apartment. Yeah of course, I’ll uh come out– did you have trouble finding the place?</span></p>
<p><span>No.</span></p>
<p><span>OK well thanks for coming–</span></p>
<p><span>Well it was mandated by the government, she said. She wasn’t bad looking. She smiled, and I remembered I wasn’t either.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>I took her to the duck pond near my apartment. They’d have given me someone who likes birds. I’d mentioned it 10 times in the form. There was a mating pair of ruddy ducks. The small auburn male with his bright blue bill stood on a rock, preening. Diligently pushing air out from his feathers to reduce buoyancy. The longer he can stay underwater, the more small crustaceans he can find, I explained. So you’re into ducks, she said. It didn’t sound like good news.</span></p>
<p><span>Nature helps me find peace.</span></p>
<p><span>And you write self help books.</span></p>
<p><span>Self-<i>published</i> books, they’re about, like– they don’t help people<i>. </i>They actually got flagged when the Incel stuff started–</span></p>
<p><span>Wait, are they like bad? Omigod are you <i>alt r–</i></span></p>
<p><span>No, no. It’s just, very honest about sex stuff, society</span></p>
<p><span>And you don’t have a job. You make a living from the books.</span></p>
<p><span>That and the Freedom Dividend, yes.</span></p>
<p><span>Are you going to ask what I do?</span></p>
<p><span>OK</span></p>
<p><span>I’m a writer too. That’s why they matched us.</span></p>
<p><span>She was pitching pilots for <i>streaming</i>, she explained. Or perhaps I’ll get <i>on staff</i> somewhere, but for now my agent’s waiting to hear back from Quibble–</span></p>
<p><span>Is that–</span></p>
<p><span>They have a billion dollars for <i>development</i> from Dubai. But I also do a lot of work in <i>branded</i>. And with nonprofits. And I’m producing an unscripted series where young women of color rescue dogs using robotics they built. That’s for Comcast.</span></p>
<p><span>It doesn’t sound like you need money.</span></p>
<p><span>Well none of it’s paying me. But I just did this to see who they gave me.</span></p>
<p><span>What do you think?</span></p>
<p><span>I asked for someone passionate about food. Travel. Someone passionate about racial justice–</span></p>
<p><span>I asked for an Asian.</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, because you want a submissive little wife?</span></p>
<p><span>No, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086Y564JC">tight pussy</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>I waited. And she did laugh.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>She moved in in January with her black Great Dane, Dante. I threw out the antibiotics I’d been hoarding in the medicine cabinet to make room for her pills. The SSRI made it hard for her to cum. It took an hour with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1790356229">two cramped fingers hooked into her</a> and my jaw starting to ache. Feeling like a medieval woodcut of a peasant plowing dry fields, while Death looms over his shoulder. Half the time I’d apologize. Take a walk, frustrated. Leave her alone with the dog. But she said without them she wasn’t herself.</span></p>
<p><span>It was hard, but she was mine. In September I asked her about taking the IUD out. It always made me feel like a weasel had bitten me. And she said maybe. Maybe soon. You’re so good with Dante.</span></p>
<p><span>Then her pilot got picked up.</span></p>
<p><span>She got a Wikipedia entry. <i>Jocelyn Finnegan is an American actress, writer, producer, personality and activist. </i>Be careful, I joked with her. You have a Wikipedia, you’ll want to leave me for a guy with a bigger Wikipedia. And he’ll want to leave you for his 22 year old Asian intern. She just glared. That’s kind of racist, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>I didn’t mean it that way.</span></p>
<p><span>You know my agent asked about your books.</span></p>
<p><span>Oh yeah?</span></p>
<p><span>Not like that. She’s worried they’ll be a story. They could be a problem for me.</span></p>
<p><span>I asked why, but I knew. Because they’re kind of <i>hateful</i>, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>They’re not hateful–</span></p>
<p><span>You said “fuck the Jews.”</span></p>
<p><span>Not <i>all</i> of them</span></p>
<p><span>Well what do you think Buzzfeed would think of that. You think it’s funny but people read this stuff and they become racist. People like you are why Brexit happened. Racists–</span></p>
<p><span>Brexit was about Polish people– are they not white</span></p>
<p><span>You <i>spread hate</i> and those <i>fucking people</i> read it and <i>that’s why we had Trump–</i></span></p>
<p><span>Jesus Christ can you let it go? He’s gone.</span></p>
<p><span>Yeah just like Voldemort was gone</span></p>
<p><span>Oh my fucking God is this real–</span></p>
<p><span>How can you not get this, she said. You think you’re fucked up because you were alone so long. But you were alone because you’re so fucked up. I’m leaving.</span></p>
<p><span>We have a year left</span></p>
<p><span>I’m requesting a transfer for abuse. They’ll give me the money prorated. Please, just don’t make this hard. If you ever cared about me, just sign–</span></p>
<p><span>I said yes. I was 46.</span></p>
<p><span>**</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know what happened to her. The pilot didn’t go to series. I think she froze her eggs. I haven’t become a story, yet.</span></p>
<p><span>Since my last partner filed the papers I was ineligible to reapply. This was not uncommon. Less than 9% of couples stayed together for the jackpot. Most partnerships terminated for abuse claims.</span></p>
<p><span>A year later I spent my last Freedom Dividend. Hard to find the right material. Amazon wouldn’t ship what you needed. Am I fucked up from being alone so long. Or am I alone because I’m so fucked up.</span></p>
<p><span>Looking back it never could have worked. Me and her, or any of it. The world moved on. The normal inherited the Earth. They saw us as the enemy. The last pocket of retrograde evil in a society moving toward sexless pet care utopia. And she was right. I did say hateful things. I did help cause problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I’m sorry for that. And for what I’m about to do.</span></p>

<p><strong>Incremental Computation</strong><br>
Incremental computation is a programming abstraction which gives users a way of writing calculations such that, when some of the inputs change, only a relevant subset of the calculation has to be recomputed. </p>
<p>The above definition is kind of vague and honestly it's best to start with an example. Let's take a look at the following mathematical expression.  </p>
<p>$$ (a+b)*c $$</p>
<p>We can evaluate this expression in two steps. First by adding a and b together, and then by multiplying the result by c. We can even write this computation out as a dependency graph:
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/comp-dag.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
Here the variables a, b, c are referred to as leaves because they have no dependencies. Now what if after we do our initial computation, the value of c changes?
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/comp-dag-2.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
We can see from this graph that since (a+b) does not depend on c, we do not need to recompute it. Now imagine scaling this idea up to larger, more complex expressions. If you are familiar with spreadsheet software, you might have flashbacks to the huge interlinked computations created there. This brings us to a second, more intuitive definition of incremental computation: Microsoft Excel on steroids.
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/excel-on-steroids.png" width="50%"> 
</p><p>
There are several different frameworks and projects for incremental computation. These include <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">several</a> <a href="http://adapton.org/">rust</a> <a href="https://github.com/lord/anchors">libraries</a>, <a href="http://skiplang.com/">Facebook's Skip Lang</a> and an OCaml library called <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incremental">Incremental</a>. I chose to play around with Incremental for my experiments, because it seems to be the most battle tested option.</p>
<p><strong>Pros/Cons</strong><br>
So far it may seem like incremental computation frameworks are magical abstractions which allow programmers to write incredibly efficient programs with ease. So why don't we all use them? Well like most things in software, incremental computation frameworks come with a few trade offs. <br>
Pros:  </p>
<ul>
<li>An incremental computation framework provides a simple abstraction around optimizing computations which allow programmers to write more efficiently computable programs with low mental overhead.</li>
<li>The abstraction provided by these frameworks generalizes well to many different types of problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The frameworks have non negligible overhead both in speed and memory. We need to make sure the computation is slow enough to justify incrementalizing. If not, the overhead of the framework could dwarf the time it would take to recompute the expression from scratch.</li>
<li>Similar to the above point, the initial computation of the algorithm will be slower. You need to decide if you will be recomputing often enough to justify this slow down.</li>
<li>There are always limitations to any particular abstraction. Therefore you will likely be able to come up with a custom algorithm for a specific problem that is much faster than the result you get using an incremental computation framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those interested in exploring these tradeoffs in detail or wanting to peek behind the curtain will enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6a5G5i4gQU">this talk</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do people use Incremental Computation</strong><br>
So where are people actually using incremental computation? As far as I know, there are a few different areas where these ideas are being applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finance, especially to deal with large spreadsheet-like calculations. Most finance companies are a little vague about what they actually do, so I don't know too much about this use case.</li>
<li>Compliers, the rust compiler explored these techniques when building their incremental compilation features.</li>
<li>Databases, the company <a href="https://materialize.io/">Materialize</a> uses technology based on the <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/courses/2015/6.S897/readings/naiad.pdf">Timely Dataflow Model</a> developed by Microsoft Research to create a better streaming database.</li>
<li>User Interfaces, user interfaces are a perfect place for incremental computation because it's important to figure out which components you actually need to re-render when something on the page changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How people shouldn't use Incremental Computation</strong><br>
Now we can get to the fun part. Over the last week, I tried to play around with Incremental (and picked up scraps of OCaml) to get a better idea of how to actually build incremental computations. </p>
<p>Of course the first thing I did was to <a href="https://github.com/Mr4k/smash-incremental-heap">break the library</a>, but after that I decided I wanted to write a small but non trivial project which used it. Since I don't have legions of highly paid quants to create large spreadsheets, I decided that use case was off the table. I felt that building a toy compiler or database would be at least a week long project by itself without incrementalizing it, so I ruled those out as well. I'm also not a huge frontend person, so a ui framework didn't seem appeal to me that much. Instead I decided to try something different:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/in-one-weekend.jpg" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>I decided to implement (3/4s of) Peter Shirley's <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf">Ray Tracing in One Weekend tutorial</a> in OCaml and then try to incrementalize a part of the ray tracing step. I will be honest, this experiment was not the most amazing thing in the world, but I think I learned a lot about what not to do with incremental computation. </p>
<p>Is this a terrible idea? Absolutely! But we can learn a lot but understanding why exactly it's terrible.</p>
<p>So how does the graph based incremental computation I talked about above even fit in with ray tracing? It turns out shooting light rays into space can be thought of as a graph.</p>
<p>First of all let's look the process of tracing one ray of light from observer to light source.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/inital-graph.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>In the above diagram, we can see a ray of light traced backwards from the viewers eye to a light source. In between, it bounces off of both a red and blue sphere.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/ray-trace-graph.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>The light blue circles are nodes in an incremental computation graph and the arrows are directed edges between them. Whenever a ray hits an object, a new incremental node is created. This node computes the location of the next bounce by reflecting the incoming ray, and depends on the location and direction of the last bounce. This means that if the direction of a previous ray in the chain changes, all subsequent ray bounces will be recomputed.</p>
<p>We can also fit additional metadata about our scene into the graph. For example, each object that a light ray hits will have a material associated with it.</p>
<p>In my model, these materials have color but also a "fuzziness" parameter that represents how reflective the material is. If the material is perfectly reflective, incoming light rays are reflected so that the angle of incedence is exactly equal to the angle of reflection. Otherwise there is a random jitter applied to the outgoing direction of the ray. The size of this jitter is controlled by the "fuzziness" parameter. </p>
<p>So the material parameters affect the final image color, as well as the direction of the outgoing ray. When the fuzziness of a material changes, we must recast all subsequent rays bouncing off of any objects which use that material. We can represent this dependency in our graph as follows: </p>
<p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/render-graph-with-materials.png" width="75%"> 
</p>

<p>In the above graph, if the fuzziness of a material changes, we will recast all subsequent rays.</p>
<p>Handling changing material parameters will be the focus of our render. The idea is that after an expensive render, an artist could tweak a few material parameters without having to redraw the entire screen.</p>
<p>But what about moving objects around? For this experiment, I decided not to implement this (fairly important) feature because I could not find a way to make it fit as nicely into the abstraction provided by Incremental. If I really wanted to do this, I'd basically just store all the rays inside a spatial acceleration structure like a octree. Then whenever a sphere's position changed, I'd query the set of rays intersecting it before and after it moved. I'd then recompute each of the nodes associated with these rays.  </p>
<p>So anyways does this material editing approach actually work? The answer is somewhat.</p>
<p>Here's a gif of it in action (in real time)!
</p><p>
  <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/incr-ray-tracer/trace-reload.gif" width="50%"> 
</p>
<p>In the above gif, each material's color and fuzziness parameters are being changed one sphere at a time. Instead of doing a full render each time something changes, Incremental figures out which rays need to be recomputed. The image above looks grainy because I'm casting only about 10 rays per pixel (for reference,  Shirley's code, which this is based off, does 100 rays per pixel). To see why I'm only taking 10 samples per pixel, let's look at some performance numbers: </p>
<table>

<p>
The benchmarks above are all taken on my 2.9 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 2015 Macbook Pro with 8GB of memory. They each used 100 spheres, each with its own unique material. Each sphere's material was changed once and I recorded the time it took to rerender after each sphere's material had changed. Each ray cast bounced a maximum of 10 times through the scene. The non incremental version is my implementation of Peter Shirley's code. Both versions of the code are single threaded.</p>
<p>Okay let's talk though this data quickly. The first four rows of the table tell a consistent story. The initial render has about a 3x to 4x overhead and editing a sphere's material results is significantly faster than a full redraw. All the numbers seem to scale linearly with the number of rays cast as expected.</p>
<p>But what about the rows after that? Runtime seems to explode in the incremental version. I was really surprised by this result. I don't have a definitive answer to this question but it did make me rethink the overhead that a library like Incremental brings to a program.</p>

At first glance, accounting for the runtime overhead of Incremental seems like it would be pretty simple. Each node that is fired requires a little bookkeeping on the Incremental side. As far as I know this overhead is typically on the order of ~50-150ns per node on commodity hardware and should grow linearly. The …</p></div></div></div>

		<p>We're thrilled to announce the <a href="https://repl.it/jam">PL Jam</a> results. Here are the criteria our judges used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshness: How novel are the ideas behind the language? This accounts for the most points since it's the Jam's theme. </li>
<li>Value: How practical/useful this language could be?</li>
<li>Polish: In its current state, how polished is the language?</li>
<li>Technical difficulty: How hard was it to implement?</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall winner will take home a total of $10,000 (prize + grant). We also picked a winner team per category, which will receive $500 each. </p>
<h2 id="overall-winner-basil">Overall winner: Basil</h2>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1598870101138_7ea2f225e8a77e1354d8879eba7e684e.png" alt="basil logo"></p>
<p>Basil (<a href="https://repl.it/@basilTeam">@basilTeam</a>) is the winner! Congratulations to teammates @elucent and @minchingtonak, two undergrads at the University of Michigan. </p>
<p>Basil describes itself as "a lightweight language with homoiconic syntax, high performance, and an emphasis on supporting expressive code. Many of its base features are based on Lisp, and you could probably consider it a Lisp dialect, but it also does a number of distinctly un-Lispy things."</p>
<p>What caught our judges' eyes are the novel ideas in compilation, its fresh take on lisp syntax, the polish, and the implementation elegance.  </p>
<h3 id="compiler">Compiler</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The main innovation is that the Basil compiler is actually an interpreter, able to interpret any Basil expression. When it gets to an expression it wants to save for runtime, it wraps it up and saves it to the end of the program. These runtime values propagate and result in an expression tree of all code reachable at runtime - notably without unnecessary operations between constants or dead code. Basil also statically type-checks this tree, so none of the code it ultimately compiles incurs a dynamic typing or boxing overhead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While ahead-of-time compilation is not a new idea -- it's typically an optimization strategy -- designing a compiler with evaluation as a core feature in the pipeline is both exciting and compelling. </p>
<h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
<p>Basil being a lisp means it's a very simple language at heart. However, while lisps are typically dynamic languages, Basil is a statically-typed and compiled language. Basil also leverages white space to both reduce the amount of parenthesis and support infix operators. </p>
<h3 id="implementation">implementation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Basil compiler has no runtime dependencies other than libc, and the entire compiler and runtime fit comfortably in under 400 kB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basil is a new language that was entirely conceived and implemented during the jam. We were impressed by how elegant and clean the code is. You can read and play with the entire thing on this one <a href="https://repl.it/@basilTeam/basil#README.md">repl</a>.</p>
<p>Basil also ships with a tutorial that teaches the language. It's a lot of fun!</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/langjam/basiltut.png" alt="basil tutorial"></p>
<h2 id="category-winners">Category winners:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Freshness: <a href="https://repl.it/talk/challenge/Roman-Lisp-extended-to-the-4th-dimension/51721">Roman</a></li>
<li>Value: <a href="https://repl.it/talk/challenge/Browse-Build-expressive-libraries-with-thunks/51805">Browse</a></li>
<li>Polish: <a href="https://repl.it/talk/challenge/CodeFlow-Experiment/51630">Codeflow</a></li>
<li>Technical difficulty: <a href="https://repl.it/talk/challenge/Volant/51740">Volant</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to all the winners! We hope your curiosity and enthusiasm for programming language design doesn't end here. We're excited to see where the Basil team take the language, and when they're ready, we hope to add it to the Repl.it family of supported languages.</p>

		<div>
			<p>Amidst the lockdowns of a global pandemic, the sounds of life have changed. For the first time in a century, the hustle and bustle that fills our streets has gone quiet. In this eerie silence, the song of the birds echoes louder than ever before.</p>
<p>Even our deepest thoughts have amplified their volume. These existential provocations used to be drowned out by the busyness of our lives. Now, they relentlessly bang their drums in the chambers of our minds.</p>
<p>Listen for a moment. Can you hear them?</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e83ff78098f8bfe15e528fc9b5480a8c134edd6d/d1b6a/img/reflection-comic.jpg" alt="The noise of our inner questions"></p>
<p><em>Are these the people I want to see?</em></p>
<p><em>Is this where I want to live?</em></p>
<p><em>Is this what I want to do?</em></p>
<p><em>…Is this it?</em></p>
</div>
<p>These questions terrify us, but we can’t seem to evade them. Our lives have become confined to one block, one room, one screen. It’s impossible to escape ourselves.</p>
<p>Like it or not, we need to face our own music.</p>
<h3 id="here-we-go-again">Here We Go, Again</h3>
<p>The discomfort of deep reflection feels familiar to me. As I follow the path of my inner questions, I see the faint outlines of my own footprints.</p>
<p>I’ve been here before.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I was a startup founder struggling with burnout. It felt like I was an asteroid, crashing and burning into the atmosphere. I was lost, confused, and utterly exhausted. I took some time off to travel and see family. Upon my return, I went to meet a good friend. He asked me what I wanted to work on next. Until that moment, I hadn’t thought too much about it. My answer shocked both of us.</p>
<p><em>“Honestly, I have no idea what I want to do. My last run wasn’t pleasant. I’m not exactly chomping at the bit to do it all over again. Frankly, I’m not even sure I want to work at all.”</em></p>
<p>My friend was taken aback. Both of us learned something that day — I was clearly not ‘rested and recuperated’. If anything, I came back from my break far less ready to work than when I left.</p>
<p>This wasn’t how I thought this would play out. After all, I had diligently followed the tried-and-true recipe for burnout recovery. I traveled. I visited family. I relaxed. After some weeks had passed, I was ready to come home. I figured I’d jump right back into the swing of things.</p>
<p>I was wrong. The recipe didn’t work.</p>
<p>But if a break didn’t solve the problem, what would? I was in uncharted territory. I knew I needed to work eventually to survive, but thankfully I still had a little buffer to figure it out. More than a decade of working my ass off in startup-mode had afforded me that privilege.</p>
<p>So I made a “freedom list”. If I had this period of time to myself, I wasn’t going to waste it. I would do all the things I had always dreamed of doing. That could be my work, at least for a little while.</p>
<p>Weeks turned into months. I stopped traveling on planes, and instead explored the far reaches of the galaxy with my mind. I dove into the world of meditation and developed a daily hour-long practice. I learned a ton about illustration, animation, character design and drawing comics. I read more than sixty books. I dove into technical subjects at a depth I had never done before.</p>
<p>Despite having no structure to my day and few commitments to keep, I found myself more productive than ever. I was driven purely by the search for wisdom, and the pursuit of my curiosities.</p>
<p>For a brief moment, I felt truly happy.</p>
<h3 id="finding-balance">Finding Balance</h3>
<p>Soon, I was ready to dip my toes back into work. I tried doing some independent consulting on a part-time basis. I wanted to create a structure for myself where I had some income while still having space to explore curiosities.</p>
<p>It was a struggle. Finding clients and marketing myself was difficult, especially since at the time I had virtually no online presence. It was also quite a lonely pursuit, and I missed working with others. I had greatly underestimated how much I cherished collaborating with a team.</p>
<p>Eventually, I went back to work full-time at a big company. I was tired of the uncertainty of a solitary pursuit. I wanted structure. I got it in spades. Throughout my time there, not a day went by where I wasn’t plagued by the same questions. I had tasted the freedom of independent pursuit, and I missed it.</p>
<p>I decided to try an independent route again, but with a twist. I secured a part-time job at a friend’s startup. I structured my work so that I’d be putting in a fixed amount of time for a fixed income. I’d get the structure I needed, along with the opportunity to collaborate with a team. The rest of the time would be free to explore creative pursuits.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with this setup for about six months now. It’s still early, but so far I’m really enjoying it. I feel well supported by the part-time job, and my creative work has been flourishing. I just published the 35th edition of my weekly newsletter. I’ve been regularly publishing essays like this one on my blog (one of which went viral on Twitter and HN). My Twitter following and engagement has been steadily growing. My drawing skills continue to improve, allowing me to draw comics like the one in this post. I’ve started a YouTube channel publishing monologue-style videos. I’ve been growing a digital garden of notes. Most importantly, I’ve built so many wonderful relationships with folks who’ve engaged with my work (this includes you — thank you!) It’s an incredible feeling to know my creativity has inspired and helped others.</p>
<p>All of this has happened in less than a year, which makes me really excited for what’s to come. I’m just getting started!</p>
<h3 id="embracing-questions">Embracing Questions</h3>
<p>I’m privileged to be able to make a setup like this work financially, but I’ve also had to make my share of sacrifices. I’m really glad I pushed myself through all the questions to get me to this point. I’ve realized this period of self-exploration was a form of Awakening. It changed me forever. I look back now at the burnout that triggered this whole journey, and I’m thankful for it. Without it, I would never be where I am now.</p>
<p>Friends who met me after a long while joked that I’m now “Salman 2.0”, as though I’ve become a different person entirely. Perhaps there’s some truth to that. I’ve discovered a new source of contentment and happiness: myself. I’ve developed a new lens through which I view the world, my life, and my purpose on this planet. Most of all, I’m grateful for having developed resilience in embracing life’s deepest questions.</p>
<p>There’s more to life than finding answers. What we really need is to develop comfort with questions.</p>
<p>The more questions we ask ourselves, the more we allow ourselves to grow.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>



<p><em>In this article, we break down the ideal architecture for “the complete customer data stack” from the perspective of the data engineer. With new customer data software tools being launched every day and unclear definitions around terms like “customer data platform,” we make the argument that these individual tools are always part of a much more comprehensive customer data stack that should be managed by IT and engineering.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In business software, terms like “unified customer data” and “360º view of the customer” are hot marketing buzzwords. Executives and, of course, salespeople say that these new tools are the best thing since sliced bread.</p>



<p>When it comes to engineering and IT organizations, though, most developers don’t think of fancy marketing software when they consider the subject of unified customer data. Instead, they think about unified data in the context of the data flows, storage, and processing that form their entire customer data pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This disparity in perspective is the unfortunate result of vendors selling to marketing and sales departments and implementing for them. Still, because the entire system isn’t considered, the result is often more siloed data (the opposite of what was promised).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we make the case that the customer data functionality sold by all vendors<em>&nbsp;is just one component (or “use case”) within a broader system for customer data infrastructure –&nbsp;</em>the comprehensive set of tools and functions that collect, manage &amp; activate customer data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of our customers described this well when explaining RudderStack as part of their stack:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“This isn’t about the success of RudderStack as an individual service, but the success of this entire effort to get our customer data infrastructure right, which means building data-driven workflows, making smarter decisions based on data and building prediction models for retention and engagement. Not every effort is directly related to the tool, but the tool is a big part of the system we are building.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>These systems are complex, touch multiple business and technical systems both internally &amp; externally and have use cases spanning the organization, from marketing to product to support (and even finance).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that IT and engineering teams are best equipped to build this customer data stack.</p>







<h2>First, Let’s Define ‘Customer Data’</h2>







<p>At the risk of pointing out the obvious, at the highest level, any data associated with a customer is customer data, and this concept predates the internet or even computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the advent of computers, businesses used to keep a ledger book of all transactions mostly for accounting &amp; planning purposes. With the advent of computers, the ledger was digitized and stored in databases, but the concept and use cases remained the same.</p>



<p>From those initial days, we have come a long way. Customer relationship management tools (CRMs) like Salesforce were the first “customer data platforms” that reached into multiple parts of the organization. However, as the ability to collect data from every customer touchpoint has become increasingly possible, the concept of a repository of customer records with a UI isn’t enough to meet the needs of truly data-driven companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers are interacting with businesses in more ways than ever before. It’s not just retail stores, but websites, mobile apps, call centers, ticketing systems, and more. Business systems have proliferated to manage and create value from all of the data. Amazingly, a typical mid-sized company uses anywhere from 10-50 tools across their departments to interact with their customers. This includes home-grown systems as well as third-party SaaS solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As any data engineer knows, the most common challenge in the modern environment is that this information about customers is siloed within the tools. Bringing all that data together to create a complete customer “view” is a non-trivial engineering problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The solution isn’t a single tool or function, but a comprehensive “customer data stack.”</p>



<p>Based on years of experience building, running, and consuming the output of various pieces of this infrastructure, we’ve mapped out the key components required to build a comprehensive, scalable system that serves the needs of an entire company (what we call “the complete customer data stack”).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note that there isn’t one vendor who solves every piece of the puzzle. Every company uses multiple tools. Many companies attempt to build these systems from scratch. In contrast, others leverage tools like Segment, <a href="https://rudderstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RudderStack</a>, DBT, Lytics, and others to manage the key components of their data pipeline (especially those that are complicated and/or expensive to build and run).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, note that this architecture is somewhat “aspirational.” Not every company has implemented or is implementing every component of the stack. Requirements for the customer data stack vary depending on the business model and stage of the company. At scale, though, truly data-driven businesses will need the functionality of every component on some level.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in and break down the key building blocks of the complete customer data stack. </p>







<h2>Components of the Complete Customer Data Stack</h2>







<p>Here is a diagram that includes all of the key components of a complete customer data stack, from data collection through all of the primary use cases. Below, we break down the function and concerns around each key component.  </p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>







<p>This is the starting point. Customer data is spread across multiple systems across multiple points in the customer journey, and the first job of a customer data stack is to collect it. Customer data comes in many forms, but a few of the most common types are:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>User behavior and clickstream events on web &amp; mobile apps (clicks, page views, product searches, account creation, etc.)</li><li>Transactional events in backend systems (financial, etc.)&nbsp;</li><li>Transactional data from customer SaaS apps for marketing, sales and support (emails, tickets, chat, etc.)</li><li>Data from internal applications for marketing, sales, and support</li><li>Structure data from external platforms (Google Ads, Clearbit, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>Beyond these, customer data can also come from key pieces of the engineering stack:</p>



<ul><li>Data Warehouses: Many companies run ETL and ELT jobs from their transactional systems into a warehouse and often include “computed” values.</li><li>AI/ML systems: Companies are increasingly deploying AI/ML systems to compute customer scores, personalized product recommendations, and more. The output of these systems also produces “unique customer data.”&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The goal of the collection component is to ingest data from all of these systems. Some data is “pulled” via APIs (e.g., from SaaS sources) while others (e.g., events) are more pushed-based—SDKs are deployed on all the sources, and those SDKs push the events via an API. Bringing data from databases like warehouses introduces additional engineering challenges. The simplest approach is to run a SQL query, but that doesn’t scale well when the volume of events. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture#:~:text=In%20databases%2C%20change%20data%20capture,taken%20using%20the%20changed%20data." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Change Data Capture (CDC) techniques</a> are alternate solutions to address this volume problem.</p>



<p>No matter the use case, any scalable customer data stack needs to address the challenge of data collection in terms of complexity and scale.</p>







<h3>Data Validation</h3>







<p>Validation is a critical component of the stack because some of the data, particularly event streams coming from mobile/web apps, is often dirty &amp; buggy because of human error, ad-blockers, browser imperfections, developer errors, DoS attacks and more. Dirty data impacts the downstream functionality severely. Thus, it needs to be dealt with carefully or blocked completely, depending on the use case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Validation is often rule-based, but increasingly companies are using AI/ML systems for “learning” the event pattern from historic data and blocking events that don’t match that pattern.</p>



<p>The validation step may also involve calling external APIs. One common validation is email verification—making sure that the email address in a customer event is correct—and this usually involves calling an email validation API.</p>



<p>No matter the use case, the data stack’s validation component is key to feeding the company with clean data, so it needs to be robust and flexible.&nbsp;</p>







<h3>Transformation, Enrichment &amp; Identity Resolution</h3>







<p>Once raw data is collected and validated, it often needs to be transformed in some way before being sent to downstream applications. Here are some common use cases: Enriching user records with additional internal data (e.g., complete user profile) or external data (e.g., job title, company name, company size, etc.). This is a massive trend in marketing and sales and often requires tapping into an API service, internal or external.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Removing PII or other sensitive customer data points</li><li>Sampling &amp; filtering events (often to reduce cost in downstream applications consuming the data)</li><li>Mapping labels or headers for unified warehouse tables or communication between downstream SaaS tools</li></ul>



<p>Another important function of the transformation component is identity resolution—mapping all the different identities a user may have (anonymous cookies, device IDs, advertising IDs, email addresses, etc.) into a canonical identifier. Tying all these identities together is a key step in combining all the data about a customer into a unified customer profile. (Add citation)</p>

            <div><p>MEPs approved tonight two separate <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2020/646174/EPRS_BRI(2020)646174_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">â€œlegislative initiativeâ€�</a> reports calling on the Commission to address and tackle current shortcomings in the online environment in its Digital Services Act (DSA) package, due to be presented in December.</p>

<p>The current EU rules for digital services have remained largely unchanged since the e-commerce directive was adopted twenty years ago. With the upcoming package, the European Union aims to shape the digital economy at EU level as well as setting the standards for the rest of the world, as it did with data protection.</p>

<p><strong>Stronger rules to tackle illegal content online </strong></p>

<p>All digital service providers established in third countries must adhere to the DSAâ€™s rules when their services are also aimed at consumers or users in the EU, MEPs say.</p>

<p>A binding â€œnotice-and-actionâ€� mechanism must be set up so that users can notify online intermediaries about potentially illegal online content or activities. This would help online intermediaries to react quickly and be more transparent regarding the actions they have taken on potentially illegal content. Users should be able to seek redress through a national dispute settlement body.</p>

<p>Parliament calls for a strict distinction to be made between illegal content and harmful content (the legal liability regime should concern â€œillegal contentâ€� only as defined in EU or national law).</p>

<p>Platforms should not use upload filters or any form of <em>ex-ante</em> content control for harmful or illegal content. The final decision on whether content is legal or not should instead be taken by an independent judiciary and not by private undertakings, say MEPs.</p>

<p>Harmful content, hate speech and disinformation should be dealt with through enhanced transparency obligations and by helping citizens to acquire media and digital literacy regarding the dissemination of such content.</p>

<p><strong>A safer internet for consumers</strong></p>

<p>The principle of â€œwhat is illegal offline is also illegal onlineâ€�, as well as consumer protection and user safety, should become the future DSAâ€™s â€œguiding principlesâ€�, says Parliament.</p>

<p>Platforms and online intermediation services will need to get better at detecting and taking down false claims and tackling rogue traders, e.g. those selling false medical equipment or dangerous products online, as happened during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>MEPs also call for a new "Know Your Business Customer" principle to be introduced, requiring platforms to check and stop fraudulent companies using their services to sell their illegal and unsafe products and content.</p>

<p>Specific rules to prevent (instead of merely remedy) market failures caused by big platforms must also be tabled to open up markets to new entrants, including SMEs and start-ups, MEPs add. More information on the Internal Market Committeeâ€™s demands, backed by plenary with 571 votes to 26, with 94 abstentions, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200925IPR87924/meps-spell-out-their-priorities-for-the-digital-services-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0181_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Making users less dependent on algorithms </strong></p>

<p>MEPs want to provide users with more control over what they see online, including being able to opt out of content curation altogether, and to make them less dependent on algorithms. Targeted advertising must be regulated more strictly in favour of less intrusive, contextualised forms of advertising that require less data and do not depend on previous user interaction with content. MEPs also call on the Commission to further assess options for regulating targeted advertising, including a phase-out leading to a ban.</p>

<p>The upcoming DSA should also provide for the right to use digital services anonymously whenever possible. Finally, to ensure compliance with the new rules, the Commission should assess options for setting up a European entity to monitor and impose fines. For more details on the Legal Affairs Committee demands approved with 637 votes to 26, with 28 abstentions, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20200925IPR87926/digital-services-managing-harmful-content-while-protecting-freedom-of-expression" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2020-0177_EN.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fundamental rights online </strong></p>

<p>A third, non-legislative resolution by the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/libe/home/highlights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civil Liberties Committee</a>, approved by 566 votes to 45, with 80 abstentions, focuses on fundamental rights issues. It calls for content removal to be â€œdiligent, proportionate and non-discriminatoryâ€� to safeguard freedom of expression and information, as well as privacy and data protection. MEPs also point out that microtargeting based on peopleâ€™s vulnerabilities is problematic, as is the spreading of hate speech and disinformation, asking for transparency on the monetisation policies of online platforms.</p>

	<div>
		<p>I’m sure everyone has heard the Mark Twain quote “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.” But I think it should be reversed to “A correction can travel halfway around the world while the lie is putting on its shoes.” Both sides, but I think especially the left, bemoan that we are living in a ‘post-truth era,’ but is there any truth to this? The evidence would seem to suggest the opposite: that although public figures lie, their lies are debunked faster than ever thanks to fact-checking, much of which is decentralized and online. Decades ago, before social media and sites such as Twitter, it took days or even weeks to refute lies, and usually only the large or important lies (such as Watergate), but with so much fact-checking by either side hoping to score ‘wins’ against the opposing side, lies, half-truths, misconstructions, and omissions, are debunked and corrected in record time, no matter how small the stakes are. </p>
<p>The Twain quote made sense in an era when the transfer and control of information was centralized by major media companies (such as radio, TV, and print), but social media allows anyone to be a fact-checker. Astute readers can immediately find the logical inconsistences and errors of stories or of other comments, pointing out the errors in the comments, which are up-voted and promoted to the top of the comments section and easily visible. Given the popularity of Twitter and Reddit, there are enough subject-matter experts and smart people, no matter how esoteric the topic, that lies and falsehoods tend to be debunked quickly, and comments that debunk or offer clarification tend to get a lot of up-votes and are algorithmically pushed to the top and thus made visible, so everyone reading can see the correction without having to scroll much. </p>
<p>Whenever Trump or AOC tweets something, without fail,  fact-checkers from opposing sides pounce, but such fact-checking is not limited to just the opposing team. For example, when AOC demonstrated that she apparently does not understand how tax credits work in regard to her opposition of Amazon’s proposal to build a headquarters in New York City, it was Bill de Blasio, of all people, who fact-checked and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/de-blasio-ocasio-cortex-claim-spending-amazon-tax-break-money">corrected</a> her, within hours of her tweet. AOC was also corrected for not understanding the <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/05/24/its-just-the-weather-meteorologist-fact-checks-ocasio-cortez-on-climate-change/">difference</a> between weather and climate change, within minutes or her tweeting about it.  </p>
<p>Additionally, with the rise of real-time fact-checking, lies are debunked in mere minutes on sites such as Vox, New York Times, Snopes, or the Washington Post, instead of having to wait weeks for an editor to post a retraction or having to wait for the lie to be dunked days or weeks later. So as Trump is debating Biden, these sites will fact-check on a  minute-by-minute basis as the words are coming out of their mouths, which is unprecedented in the history of journalism or fact-checking.  </p>
<p>Just a dew days ago, the White House was forced to retract a statement that Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Coney Barrett is a  “Rhodes Scholar”, when she actually only attended a place called Rhodes College. So that falsehood lasted less than a day, and although it is trivially easy to verify the source of the confusion, it shows how quickly falsehoods are debunked and corrected in the era of social media. </p>
<p>And in 2004, there was the infamous Killian documents controversy, in which documents purporting to show Bush’s misdeeds during his service in the Texas Air National Guard, were revealed to be a hoax, thanks to an independent investigation by fact-checkers who determined through typography analysis that the memo was not from 1972 as originally claimed, but instead produced on a desktop computer using modern-day word-processing program. The story of the memo possibly being fake went viral, forcing a retraction by CBS just a day later and the eventual resignation of Dan Rather.  </p>
<p>It is not just the news, but debunking and fact-checking also applies to organizations. The reason why Scientology (and other cults) thrived in the 20th century was not because people were more gullible, but because there was no cost-effective way to debunk such cults, and while Scientology is profitable, debunking it isn’t, so this means that pro-Scientology  messages will tend to prevail over anti-Scientology ones. But fast-forward to the 2000s and it costs next to nothing to put up a webpage debunking Scientology, whereas public service awareness ads are expensive and was the only option 50 years ago.  Now anyone can Google ‘Scientology’ and a bunch of negative stuff pops up. Unless the public service ads are run constantly, much like those anti-tobacco ads in the 2000s that were funded by litigation, the odd are pretty high that many people will not see the ads unless they tune in to the radio or TV constantly, but Google search results, unlike ads, are close to permanent and not ephemeral. </p>
<p>Even if lies are more prevalent now than they were in Twain’s era, I think the means and tools for debunking them are more powerful than ever, which means the likelihood that someone will get the ‘correct version’ of the story are much higher. For all the talk of ‘fake news’ and ‘alternative facts’ I would posit that the average person who follows the news, thanks to fact-checking and speedy corrections, is better-informed  than someone from generations ago in terms of having the correct version of a story. Politicians and other public figures will continue to lie, but the truth at least stands a much better chance of prevailing, even if, of course, there is no guarantee it will. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d6b2b3bbb996a1b9a4bdb9a5fbb9bda2b7f8b5b9bb">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-398c45a3fde378e52a9c"><div><p>Software is eating the world and APIs are at the forefront. Not only do APIs give developers instant access to powerful functionality, but their programmability also makes it easy for developers to integrate disparate pieces of functionality.</p><p>But today, this only applies to <em>documented</em> APIs. This means the company responsible for the API has made a conscious choice to expose the API—and they’ve allocated the resources to creating and maintaining documentation. This also means there are a <em>lot</em> of SaaS APIs out there that could make users’ lives easier, but that haven’t been documented.</p><p>This blog post is about a new feature that my team and I built after I spent a painful couple of days figuring out how to script against Notion. After my experience trying to learn the undocumented Notion API, we decided to automate the process of learning web APIs so that nobody would have to suffer like this again.</p><p>In this blog post, I talk about:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How I tried to automate against the Notion the hard way.</p></li><li><p>How this led my team at Akita to build a new feature to automatically learn undocumented APIs.</p></li><li><p>How to use Akita to <em>automatically</em> learn APIs, including the Notion API. (See what we learned on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>!)</p></li></ul><p>To anyone who wants to learn an undocumented API–or document your own API so people don’t have to do this—you may be interested in checking out <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">our private beta</a>!<br></p><h2>🐕 First, some background</h2><p>I’m Chris, the product manager at Akita. I joined Akita after eight years at Twilio, where I helped define products like Twilio Marketplace and Twilio Channels. While I was making APIs easier to use at Twilio, I also saw how APIs made software development harder. For instance, the rise of internal and external APIs make it much more difficult to prevent breaking changes. These observations led me to join Akita about a year ago.</p><p>At Akita, we’ve been working to give structure to the interaction graph of APIs, for instance to <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/22/faster-better-earlier-catch-breaking-changes-by-diffing-api-behavior?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">detect breaking changes in web apps</a>. Akita watches API traffic to automatically generate API specs and infer implicit API contracts. Core to Akita’s approach is diffing API specs and contracts learned across different environments. We’ve been working hard to make this technology easily accessible to developers, no code changes required, in just minutes.</p><h2>💡 An observation about Notion&nbsp;</h2><p>Now for how I came to autogenerate an API spec for Notion.</p><p>As the product manager at a small startup, I spend a lot of time making sure that the right information gets to the right place. Customer feedback, blog posts like this one, product usage, and engineering metrics are just a few of the things I need to track. I also require some sleep, food, and the occasional trip outside. How do I manage to keep up? That’s easy: AUTOMATE ALL THE THINGS!!!</p><p>When I joined Akita, I realized that Notion was what we needed to organize information across the team. But the problems started when we needed to add <em>new</em> information to Notion. For instance, we keep team meeting information in Notion. Most of our team meetings began with “Did someone create a Notion page?” or “Where is the page from last week’s meeting?” The same thing would happen during customer meetings.</p><p>Given how many meetings we have a week, I figured we could get several hours back <em>a week</em> if we could get computers to automate creating the Notion page for us. All we needed was to figure out how to automate Notion.<br></p><h2>😰 Thwarted by the Private API</h2><p>The catch? Notion doesn’t have a publicly documented API.</p><p>The good news is that it’s still possible to use an undocumented API. It’s easy. You could set up a headless browser to automate clicks or turn to that ol’ standby Grease Monkey script for watching your browser traffic. I recently read a blog post where the author ran a proxy and executed a man-in-the-middle attack in order to build a calendar widget for one of his favorite websites.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_27960"><div><p>Okay, it’s not easy. It took me a couple days of hacking to get a <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriscorcoran/51b2f37a807e6f09cbbf320b63b8931a?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">reasonable solution working</a> the first time. And the undocumented API problem is prevalent among newer SaaS tools, and it makes sense: APIs are hard to build, document, and maintain. If more of these tools had APIs, I would automate more and integrate them more deeply into our workflows.<br></p><h2>⚡️ Using Akita to learn the Notion API</h2><p>I wondered if there was a better way.</p><p>Then I realized: oh wait, I’m working on building a tool that <em>lets you generate API specifications by monitoring network traffic</em>. Surely we could use Akita to build API specs from watching my interactions with Notion?</p><p>But it wasn’t completely straightforward. Up to this point, we had set up Akita with the assumption that the user wants to document their <em>own</em> API, so Akita worked by listening to network traffic through an agent.</p><p>But when I posed this problem to my engineering team, they came up with a solution that let me generate this beautiful rendition of the Notion API spec.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_67186"><p>This feature was a game-changer! Now that Akita could learn this spec, I had an OpenAPI specification that detailed every endpoint, parameter, and property that the Notion frontend used. And what made this <em>really</em> useful was Akita’s analysis layered on top.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_72403"><div><p><a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/blog/2020/9/29/taking-types-to-the-next-level-stop-api-bugs-by-inferring-data-formats?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">Akita Data Formats</a>, detecting precise data formats like unique IDs and specific datetime RFCs,&nbsp; and API Relationships, surfacing which endpoints accept values of the same data type, made it easier to understand how the endpoints worked together.</p><div><p>You can check out the API spec we were able to generate on SwaggerHub <a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Akita-Software/notion-api-experiment/0.0.1?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.</p></div><h2>🛠 How it works</h2><p>The secret to this new feature? HAR Files.</p><p>Previously, to run Akita you ran an agent alongside where you hosted a service. The agent would listen to network traffic and allow you to autogenerate API specs without having to make code changes or use a proxy. While this was super easy to use if you were learning your <em>own</em> API, it was less helpful for learning other people’s web APIs. Our new HAR file ingest allows you to learn <em>any web API</em> that relies on AJAX-style requests, <em>using any major web browser,</em> in a matter of minutes.</p><p>HAR Files are a little known feature of the Webkit Developer Console (available in major browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) that allows you to record requests, performance metrics, and other interesting data from a debugging session. It turns out that it’s not so hard to extend Akita to accept HAR files instead of network traffic. HAR files are key to making it easy to autogenerate API specs, without needing headless servers or proxies.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_160214"><p>Below I show a screen capture of me trying to break this new feature by returning to my old nemesis, Notion. In just minutes, I was able to automatically learn what had previously taken me days to uncover!</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1603217507152_122897"><div><p>All you need to do in order to generate a spec is:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Navigate to the website you want to learn an API for and start network log recording. (See instructions across different browsers <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204410413-Generating-a-HAR-file-for-troubleshooting">here</a>.)</p></li><li><p>Interact with the website to generate traffic.</p></li><li><p>Save your HAR file and use the Akita CLI to upload it to Akita.</p><pre><code>akita har ingest --service {SERVICE} {PATH_TO_HAR_FILE}</code></pre></li><li><p>You’re done! You’ll get a link for the generated API spec. 🎉</p></li></ol><p>Note that if you’re on the other side and want to learn a spec for your <em>own</em> API, the steps you follow are even simpler!</p><h2>🏝&nbsp; It’s your turn to live your best life</h2><p>Now that HAR file ingest is an official Akita feature, you, too, can wield this incredible power. With our new HAR File Ingest feature, you can now use Akita to learn the spec of any website you are using—and write time-saving automations like my script <a href="https://gist.github.com/chriscorcoran/51b2f37a807e6f09cbbf320b63b8931a?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.</p><p>If you’re interested in autogenerating API specs, sign up for our private beta <a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_campaign=2020_pre_launch&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=2020_10_20_product_update">here</a>.

			<p>I’ve always been curious about fractals, and the book I’m reading uses fractals in an example. I started playing with the example, and found it a good chance to see how much faster a powerful cloud computer can render a fractal than my modest laptop. In this post you’ll see what a fractal is, how to generate an image of a fractal, and how to animate a fractal. We’ll do all of this locally, and then when we’ve found something interesting to focus on we’ll move the rendering to a more powerful cloud computer.</p>
<p>This post will not get into highly-optimized cloud deployments such as clusters, but it will show you how to run medium-size jobs much faster than you can locally, for just a few dollars of cloud computing time. You will need a credit card to try this, as the free tiers on most cloud platforms are no more powerful than a modest laptop.</p>
<p>By the time you’re finished, you’ll be able to generate an animation like this:</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-fractal-image">Generating a fractal image</h2>
<p>Fractals can be visualized on the complex plane, which shows the real and imaginary components of complex numbers on separate axes. It might be helpful to have a quick overview of complex numbers.</p>
<h3 id="complex-numbers">Complex numbers</h3>
<p>If you’re unfamiliar with complex numbers, they’re numbers made up of a real component and an imaginary component. A simple complex number would be written like this:</p>
<p>In this notation, <code>j</code> is the square root of -1. Mathematicians tend to use <em>i</em> to represent this value, while computer scientists tend to use <em>j</em> to avoid confusion with the convention of using <em>i</em> to represent an index in a loop. An arbitrary complex number is typically written as <code>a + bi</code>. We can do many operations with complex numbers such as adding and subtracting, multiplying, squaring, and more.</p>
<p>In Python, you can define a complex number in several ways. You can simply use the notation just shown:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>type</span>(c)
<span>&lt;</span><span>class</span> <span>'</span><span>complex</span><span>'&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can also explicitly construct a complex number by passing the real and imaginary components to the <code>complex()</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> <span>complex</span>(<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c
(<span>2</span><span>+</span><span>3j</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>When you have a complex number, you can extract its real and imaginary parts at any time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c<span>.</span>real
<span>2.0</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c<span>.</span>imag
<span>3.0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once you have a complex number, you can do all of the common operations on them:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>=</span> <span>2</span> <span>+</span> <span>3j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c2 <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1.5</span> <span>+</span> <span>2.4j</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>+</span> c2
(<span>0.5</span><span>+</span><span>5.4j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>-</span> c2
(<span>3.5</span><span>+</span><span>0.6000000000000001j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1 <span>*</span> c2
(<span>-</span><span>10.2</span><span>+</span><span>0.2999999999999998j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> c1<span>**</span><span>2</span>
(<span>-</span><span>5</span><span>+</span><span>12j</span>)
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>abs</span>(c1)
<span>3.605551275463989</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Complex numbers can be plotted on a plane in much the same way we plot coordinate pairs on an xy plane. Instead of an x-axis and a y-axis, we have a real axis and an imaginary axis. The real axis is usually horizontal, like the x axis, and the imaginary axis is typically vertical.</p>
<p>Complex numbers, despite their use of the word “imaginary”, have many real-world applications. Complex numbers appear in the physics of electromagnetic phenomena, fluid dynamics, and quantum mechanics.</p>
<h3 id="testing-points-in-a-fractal">Testing points in a fractal</h3>
<p>A fractal can be generated by asking a question at every point in a given region on the complex plane. Consider the point <code>p = 0.8 + 0.8j</code>, which is a little up and to the right of the origin. Consider another complex number, <code>c = -0.62772 - 0.42193j</code>. We want to repeatedly apply the following sequence of operations, and ask if the result ever exceeds a critical value:</p>
<ul>
<li>0th iteration: Square the complex number representing the point we’re considering, and add c to this number. This is the new complex number we’ll focus on.
<ul>
<li>Take the absolute value of the new complex number. Check if this has exceeded the critical value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1st iteration: Square the new complex number and add c again. This is the new complex number to focus on.
<ul>
<li>Take the absolute value of the new complex number; check if this has exceeded the critical value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Repeat this operation until the result exceeds a critical value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at this sequence for the point <code>0.8 + 0.8j</code>, with a critical value of 2:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Iteration</th>
<th>Input value</th>
<th>Input value squared plus c</th>
<th>Abs value of result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.8+0.8j</td>
<td>-0.628+0.858j</td>
<td>1.063</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>-0.628+0.858j</td>
<td>-0.97-1.499j</td>
<td>1.786</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>-0.97-1.499j</td>
<td>-1.934+2.486j</td>
<td>3.15</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>After the 0th iteration, the value we’re examining is 1.063, which is less than our critical value of 2.0. After iteration 1, the value is 1.786. After iteration 2, the value for this point is 3.15, which exceeds our critical value of 2.0.</p>
<p>Not all points are as simple as this. Consider the point <code>p = 0 + 0j</code>, which is the origin in the complex plane. Let’s look at the sequence for this point:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Iteration</th>
<th>Input value</th>
<th>Input value squared plus c</th>
<th>Abs value of result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0.00.0j</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The final value for each iteration is bouncing around between 0 and 1. We have no way of knowing at this point if it will ever break out of this region. Let’s graph these values over a larger number of iterations. Here’s what that pattern looks like:</p>




<div>
    <p><img src="https://ehmatthes.com/blog/cloud_fractal/my_images/julia_boundedness_0-0.png"></p><p>The point 0 + 0j appears to bounce without leaving this region.</p>
</div>
<p>After 50 iterations, the result is still oscillating between 0 and 2. For any given point, we can’t tell whether the result will stay bounded as we complete more iterations; we can only state a number of iterations by which the point is still within the bounds we’ve set.</p>
<h3 id="generating-a-fractal-image-1">Generating a fractal image</h3>
<p>To generate a fractal image, we choose a region and conduct this set of calculations for every point in the region. We then assign each point in the region a color based on how many iterations it took for that point to exceed the critical value. We’ll first do this mathematically, by making a scatter plot. But then, to focus on the visualization, we’ll simply generate an image.</p>
<p>To get started, make a new directory for this project. Then create a virtual environment and install the two libraries we’ll need:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">$ mkdir exploring_fractals
$ cd exploring_fractals
$ python3 -m venv ef_env
$ source ef_env/bin/activate
(ef_env)$ pip install --upgrade pip
(ef_env)$ pip install numpy matplotlib
(ef_env)$ pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre></div><p>We’re going to need NumPy to make a range of floats, and we’ll plot the fractal using Matplotlib. We’ll use the requirements.txt file to create an identical project environment on the remote server.</p>
<p>Here’s the first part of our code, which I’m saving as julia_set_plot.py:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>"""Generate an image of the julia set."""</span>

<span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>
<span>from</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>import</span> pyplot <span>as</span> plt


<span># Bounds and critical values</span>
a_bound, b_bound <span>=</span> <span>1.8</span>, <span>1.8</span>
c <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>0.62772</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.42193j</span>
max_iterations <span>=</span> <span>20</span>
escape_bound <span>=</span> <span>2</span>
num_steps <span>=</span> <span>200</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The values <code>a_bound</code> and <code>b_bound</code> specify the region of the complex plane that we’ll focus on. We’ll focus on the region bounded by <code>a_bound + b_bound*j</code>, <code>a_bound - b_bound*j</code>, <code>-a_bound - b_bound*j</code>, and <code>-a_bound + b_bound*j</code>. We need to specify how many iterations to try on each point; we’ll set this value at 20 right now to make sure our program runs reasonably quickly. The value <code>num_steps</code> specifies how many points to test betweeen <code>-a_bound</code> and <code>a_bound</code>, and <code>-b_bound</code> and <code>b_bound</code>. A value of 200 steps will give us a scatter plot with 200 * 200 points. We’ll increase this value once we know things are working.</p>
<p>Now we need a function to determine the number of iterations it takes to exceed the critical value for any given point, up to <code>max_iterations</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>...</span>
num_steps <span>=</span> <span>200</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_iterations</span>(point):
    <span>"""How many iterations does it take to exceed the critical value?"""</span>
    iteration <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    pv <span>=</span> point<span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>+</span> c
    <span>while</span> iteration <span>&lt;</span> max_iterations:
        <span>if</span> <span>abs</span>(pv) <span>&gt;</span> escape_bound:
            <span>return</span> iteration
        <span>else</span>:
            pv <span>=</span> pv<span>**</span><span>2</span> <span>+</span> c
            iteration <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>return</span> iteration
</code></pre></div><p>The function <code>get_iterations()</code> takes in a complex point. It keeps track of the number of iterations, starting at 0. We square the point and add c, and call this <code>pv</code> for <em>point value</em>. While the iteration number is less than <code>max_iterations</code>, we check if the absolute value of the point value is less than the critical escape bound that we’ve previously set. If it is, we return the number of iterations. If the point value hasn’t exceeded the critical value yet, we prepare for another iteration by setting the new point value equal to the previous value squared plus c, and increment the number of iterations. Finally, we return the iteration number if we exit the loop without having exceeded the critical value.</p>
<p>Now we need a function that will loop over all the points in the region, and return these points along with the number of iterations for each point. Here’s the function, which we’ll call <code>get_julia_points()</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>...</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_iterations</span>(point):
    <span>...</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_julia_points</span>():
    <span>"""Define the points, and the number of iterations for each point."""</span>
    points, …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Curating your <a href="https://querystash.com/">QueryStash</a> with Tags and extra metadata allows us to
make <a href="https://querystash.com/blog/search-your-stash">Search</a> really easy, to help you retrieve the query you need,
when you need it. However sometimes it makes more sense to physically curate related queries
together in one place. Just as you would with your files in a folder or music in a playlist,
specifically indicating that these things belong in the same place.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/collection_item.png">
</p>

<h2 id="introducing-collections">Introducing Collections</h2>

<p>Collections are specifically designed to help group content together. Everything from related
snippets like math formulas, to extensive analysis projects that involve many queries to generate
the results.</p>

<p>For now think of them exactly like you would folders, if it belongs together stash it in the
same place. The additional benefit is a query can belong to many collections, so if it makes
sense why not add it to multiple collections.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-collection">Create a Collection</h2>

<p>To get started navigate to the <a href="https://app.querystash.com/collections">Collections</a> page. 
Here you will find your blank canvas to start your collections journey.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/collection_start.png">
</p>

<p>Go ahead and click that big blue button above to create your first Collection. Alternatively
click the “New Collection” button on the right hand side. Hopefully this will be very familiar
territory for yourself as this is exactly the same as the new Query process.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/create_collection.png">
</p>

<p>Once you land at the New Collection page, you have a very short form to complete with some
essential information.</p>

<p>Complete the form with a Collection title and a brief description to encapsulate the purpose
of the collection. Don’t worry too much you can add to the description and change the title at
any point.</p>

<p>Hit save and your new Collection is ready to start adding to.</p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/add_to_collection.png">
</p>

<p>When you view your Stash or an individual query, you will notice a new folder icon has been
added to the query menu, click the button and view the list of Collections you have created.
Select any Collection to add the query.</p>

<p>Omce you have added a few queries head back to the Collections page and view your new curated 
Collection. Still haven’t created your first query? <a href="https://querystash.com/blog/your-first-query.html">View our guide.</a></p>

<p><img src="https://querystash.com/assets/img/app/collection_view.png">
</p>

<h2 id="whats-next-for-collections">What’s Next for Collections?</h2>

<p>Organising is really just the start of Collections, the end goal is really to enable the ability
to not only organise but tell stories. Imagine the full analysis project from SQL code, to output 
results tables, to interactive visualisations, all connected through commentary text.</p>

  <time datetime="2020-07-04T00:00:00+00:00">04 Jul 2020</time>
  <p>I heard a lot lately about using types in Haskell to describe function arguments in more details
(e.g. function takes a list that is non-empty) and thus achieve higher compile-time safety.
It sounded cool so I decided to research more about it and I created this blog post as a memo of
what I learned.</p>

<p>Resources I used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200212212525/https://andre.tips/wmh/generalized-algebraic-data-types-and-data-kinds/">Tutorial on GADTs and DataKinds by andre.tips</a>
    <ul>
      <li>explains GADTs well, but DataKinds not so much. I would recommend to start with this one.
  [The page seems to be down, so I linked to the Wayback Machine url.]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/04/26/basic_type_level_programming_in_haskell.html">Basic Type Level Programming in Haskell by Matt Parsons</a>
    <ul>
      <li>pretty extensive, but not so intuitive. Still the most complete intro (and pretty much
the only one) to the topic. Most of my examples below are taken from it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-type-level-programming">Why type-level programming?</h2>

<p>As I wrote above, my current understanding is that with it we can add more info into the type
signature of a function, making it “safer” in the compile time.
E.g. instead of just saying <em>“this function takes a list”</em>
we can say <em>“this function takes a non-empty list”</em>, or
<em>“this function takes Int which is &gt; 10 and &lt; 127”</em> (although this last one might be solved just by
creating an appropriate type, e.g. using TH?).</p>

<p>TODO: I would love to learn about more examples where this is used.</p>

<h2 id="example-a-function-that-accepts-only-a-non-empty-list">Example: A function that accepts only a non-empty list</h2>

<p>We want to be able to tell from its type whether a list is empty or not. To do that we will
create a new type which will have that information stored in it.</p>

<p>First, let’s see how we would create a “normal” list type on our own:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is a usual recursive definition of list (<code>Cons</code> stands for <em>Constructor</em>). Once there is
an instance of this type we can tell which type of elements the list contains (e.g. <code>List Int</code>
or <code>List (Maybe String)</code>), but nothing more than that. We cannot deduce from its type (which means
in compile time) whether it is empty or not.</p>

<p>We could of course check it in runtime and throw an exception if the list is empty, but we want to
be stricter than that. We want to ensure that program cannot even be compiled if an empty list is
provided where it shouldn’t be.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-we-missing">What are we missing?</h3>

<p>The problem with the “normal” list we defined above is that we are missing information in its type.
We have only one piece of
information and that is type of the elements within the list - we use type parameter <code>a</code> to declare
that. We can also use it to define functions that work only for a specific <code>a</code>. E.g. here is a
function that works only on a list of integers:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>sumListElements</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>This is guaranteed in compile-time. If we call this function with a list of e.g. <code>Bool</code>s, the
compiler will throw an error at us.</p>



<p>So here’s an idea - why don’t we just use the same mechanism again (having a type parameter) to
know whether a list is empty or not. If we added another type parameter to keep track of that,
our type (disregarding data constructors for now) would look like this:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Just as type param <code>a</code> means <em>any type</em> (e.g. <code>Int</code> or <code>MyType</code>), the same applies for <code>empty</code>.
E.g. we could have <code>List Int Double</code> or <code>List String Bool</code> or <code>List Int SomeCustomType</code>.
Just as we restricted function <code>sumListElements</code> above to work only when <code>a</code> is <code>Int</code>, we can use
<code>empty</code> in the same way.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to implement a safe version of <code>head</code> function - that means it accepts only a
non-empty list as an argument, otherwise it won’t compile. We will call it <code>safeHead</code>.</p>

<p>Ok, we introduced <code>empty</code> as another type parameter, but the question we are facing now is what
do we do with it? Which concrete types will take its place and how?</p>

<p>Lets introduce two new types:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>The interesting thing here is that we have only type constructors for these types and no data
constructors. That means we cannot create instances (values) of these types, but that is ok!
We need these types only at the type level, in function signatures. Such types are also called
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Empty_type"><em>uninhabited</em> or <em>empty</em></a>.</p>

<p>Now let’s imagine we have a way to correctly assign <code>Empty</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> to empty and non-empty
lists’ types. Then we could define <code>safeHead</code> as follows:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>safeHead</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
<span>safeHead</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>elem</span> <span>_</span> <span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>elem</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We wouldn’t even have to define a case for <code>End</code> since the type guarantees it can’t ever happen.</p>

<h3 id="assigning-correct-type-to-empty">Assigning correct type to <code>empty</code></h3>

<p>The main question that is left is how do we produce such lists with an extra type parameter, and
how do we make sure which type <code>empty</code> takes when? This is what we will look at now.</p>

<p>This is how our type <code>List</code> looks once we have added <code>empty</code> as a second type parameter:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Except adding that extra type parameter, nothing else changed. When I first saw this,
I was confused by
the fact there is a type parameter on the left side that doesn’t appear anywhere on the right side
as a data.
How is that possible, why would that make sense? (Ok, <em>there is</em> <code>empty</code> on the right side here, but
only as a part of a type designation and not as a part of data constructor. Which means there will
never be anything of type <code>empty</code> in some value of this type).</p>

<p>But turns out it does make sense, since we use it as a designation at the type level only, to show
that an
underlying value has a certain property (empty or non-empty in this case). Such types, which have a
type parameter(s) on the left side that don’t appear on the right are
also called <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Phantom_type"><em>phantom types</em></a>.</p>

<p>Let’s see now what happens if we create an instance of our new <code>List</code> and test its type in GHCi:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>emptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>emptyList</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>"haskell"</span> <span>End</span>
<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>nonEmptyList</span>
<span>nonEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>[</span><span>Char</span><span>]</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we can see, GHCi concluded that <code>a</code> is a string in <code>nonEmptyList</code>, but could not deduce anything
for <code>empty</code> in either case, since it is not used anywhere. So how can we solve that
and make sure that <code>empty</code> becomes <code>Empty</code> for <code>emptyList</code> and <code>NonEmpty</code> for <code>nonEmptyList</code>?</p>

<h3 id="gadts">GADTs</h3>

<p>Before we continue, let’s check types of our data constructors, <code>End</code> and <code>Cons</code> (since they are
functions as well, we can do that):</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>Cons</span>
<span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see they have no power to change or specify <code>empty</code> type param in any way. <code>End</code> will leave
it unspecified, while <code>Cons</code> will preserve it from the input list. Also, we have no way to change
these type signatures as they are automatically derived from <code>List</code> type definition.</p>

<p>This is exactly where GADTs come in. GADTs (<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT">Generalized Algebraic Data Types</a>) is a Haskell extension that lets us explicitly
define the type signatures of data constructors.</p>

<p>Before seeing GADTs in action, let’s first remind ourselves of the standard,
non-GADT definition of <code>List</code> we used above:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Now let’s rearrange it a bit and add types of data constructors in comments so we can more easily
reason about them:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>|</span>                   <span>-- End :: List a empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>   <span>-- Cons :: a -&gt; List a empty -&gt; List a empty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>As we mentioned, the types in the comments are automatically derived and we cannot control them. But
that is exactly what we want to do, and GADTs let us achieve that using the following syntax:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>{-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
    <span>Cons</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We can see it is very similar to our “rearranged” <code>List</code> definition above! What GADTs let us do
is write by ourselves types of data constructors (which were in the previous definition in the
comments), giving us control to specify them as we wish!</p>

<p>The difference in the syntax is that we have to add <code>where</code> after the type name and then
for each data constructor we specify its type signature.</p>

<p>Now we finally have the power to control <code>empty</code> type parameter (in <code>List a empty</code>)! We specified
that <code>End</code> will mark list as <code>Empty</code>, while <code>Cons</code> will mark it as <code>NonEmpty</code>. And this is exactly
what we wanted to do, because if we used <code>End</code> we know the list is empty, while if we used <code>Cons</code>
we know there is at least one element in it, which makes it non-empty.</p>

<p>Let’s see it in action! Using it stays the same as without GADTs, just that this time there will
be <code>empty</code> type param which assumes an appropriate type:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>End</span>
<span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>

<span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span><span>)</span>
<span>Cons</span> <span>5</span> <span>End</span> <span>::</span> <span>Num</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>Wohoo, this works now! We see we can construct values of this type and we will always know whether
it is empty or not. <code>safeHead</code> function we defined above will work on these without any problems.</p>

<p>One possible “downside” of GADTs is that it is a language extension we have to enable, thus making
our codebase a bit heavier (longer compilation time?) and less “standard”.</p>

<p>Sometimes we can avoid using GADTs with smart constructors. Let’s see what that is and how it would
work in this case.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Smart_constructors">Smart constructor</a> is simply a function that is used
to create a certain value instead of using its
data constructor directly. We typically do that (hide data constructors and expose smart
constructor functions) when we want to have extra control over the value creation. E.g. we want to
make some extra checks, or make sure an invalid value isn’t provided etc.</p>

<p>For example, we could provide a following smart constructor to create an empty list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>::</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>createEmptyList</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>And this works! By defining the type signature of <code>createEmptyList</code> we made sure that <code>empty</code> will
always assume the type of <code>Empty</code> when this function is called. Since <code>End</code> has a type signature
<code>End :: List a empty</code>, we just “casted” type param <code>empty</code> here into a specific type.</p>

<p>Let’s try to do the same for the other data constructor, adding an element to the list:</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>Empty</span>
<span>data</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>

<span>data</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>=</span> <span>End</span> <span>|</span> <span>Cons</span> <span>a</span> <span>(</span><span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span><span>)</span>

<span>addElemToList</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>empty</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>NonEmpty</span>
<span>add…</span></code></pre></figure></article></div></div>

The government issued advice and guidance in place of rules and restrictions. School and work went ahead. Many businesses stayed open.&nbsp;</p>  <p>But as of Monday,&nbsp;Sweden's per capita death rate from COVID-19 was the 15th highest in the world, or 13th if you exclude the tiny countries of Andorra and San Marino,&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/5800901/coronavirus-map/">according to data from Time magazine and Johns Hopkins University</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Now Sweden&nbsp;is shifting its policy. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/17/sweden-considers-local-lockdowns-shift-coronavirus-strategy/">According to the Telegraph</a>,&nbsp;starting Monday, the government has empowered regional health authorities — in consultation with the federal public health agency —&nbsp;to instruct citizens&nbsp;to stay away from crowded spaces like shopping malls, museum, gyms, and concerts, and avoid taking public transport or visiting the elderly. However, there will be no&nbsp;legal or financial consequences for non-compliance.</p>  <p>Einhorn,&nbsp;a virologist, author and filmmaker in Sweden,&nbsp;is one dozens of medical experts who have been critical of the country's COVID-19 response from the start.

They assumed that this would be like SARS; it would never sort of be a major problem in Sweden or outside of Southeast Asia. They were convinced it's only spread from symptomatic people, so like SARS, you could isolate the symptomatic people and stop the spread that way.</p>  <p>That was fair, you know, sometime in January. It was not fair in April or in May. So they stuck to that. And one could say that when the spread really …&nbsp;hit Europe and Sweden, they did the opposite of our Scandinavian and Nordic neighbours who went into lockdown, and we did not.</p>  <p><strong>There was an idea that we heard from coming from Sweden in the spring, and I guess it continued, that Sweden would attempt something called "herd immunity," that if enough people were to contract the virus, that eventually there would be a general immunity enough within the population that it would have a better effect than locking things down and keeping people from getting it. Is that what happened?</strong></p>  <p>It has been assumed that they were going for herd immunity, but they've been speaking through two sides of their mouths. On the one hand, they've been denying it. On the others, on the other hand, they said it would be a bonus.</p>  <p>They said that come fall, and the second wave, we will be much better protected than our Scandinavian neighbours who had 10 times less deaths than we did in relation to population. But it became very clear once broad testing of antibodies was being done that there was nothing close to herd immunity.</p>  <p>And so, of course, they realize that they can't go for herd immunity. It's going to kill too many people. I mean, it's already killed almost 6,000 people in a population of 10 million. So they are no longer going for herd immunity, which doesn't mean that they're prepared to say, "we were wrong and we're going to change our recommendations."</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768040.1603128896!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Anders Tegnell of the Public Health Agency of Sweden attends a news conference updating the country about COVID-19 on Oct. 9.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Claudio Bresciani/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>At the centre of all of this, as we have followed what's going on in Sweden, is a man named </strong><strong>Anders&nbsp;Tegnel, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, and he seems to be a bit of a rock star in your country for the decisions he made. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tegnell-tattoo-idUSKCN2292G7">People have tattoos of him on their bodies.</a> So why is he so popular?</strong></p>  <p>This is a combination of factors, and this deserves a long discussion. Part of it, I'm sure, is that when there's a national crisis, people want to believe in authority.</p>  <p>The other aspect is that he has a very calming demeanour. Even when the numbers were going through the roof, he kept saying that we're flattening out, we're hitting the peak. He had a way of sounding extremely calming.</p>  <p>And also, you know, 90 per cent of the deaths were in the elderly, so …&nbsp;most people didn't see it.</p>  <p><strong>And what do you think of&nbsp;Anders&nbsp;Tegnel?</strong></p>  <p>I have no opinions about him personally, but I think he has not handled this well and he keeps on not handling this well.</p>  <p>Just as an example, Sweden is [one of the only countries],&nbsp;together with Somalia, Yemen, Eritrea, Syria, Greenland and some Pacific islands, who have still no recommendations for face masks whatsoever. So, you know, he hates face masks. He says they don't help. He keeps saying there's no support for them.</p>  <p>In the spring, that could have been a fair assumption. But by now, there's the studies are overwhelmingly showing the benefit of face masks, especially when it's used in the whole population, because it protects against someone who is sick.</p>  <p>So if everybody wears it, face masks are extremely efficient. But if only 50 per cent wear it, it's not at all sufficient. But he will not even say that they're good. I mean, you have to understand, in the Swedish hospitals, the doctors and nurses do not wear face masks.</p>    <p><strong>Well, it seems that [U.S. President] Donald Trump and the people around him would agree with Anders&nbsp;Tegnel.&nbsp;But the rest of the world, at least in countries where they have policies, they are not doing that. So somebody is right and somebody is wrong.</strong></p>  <p>The interesting thing is that in Sweden, we have a social democratic government dominated by the Social Democrats, so …&nbsp;it's more of a left-wing policy. Whereas in the rest of the world, it's very much a right-wing <em>laissez faire</em> policy to have herd immunity, or to try to have herd immunity, or to not wear face masks. Freedom, you know?</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768036.1603128765!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/health-coronavirus-sweden-cases.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>A sign promoting physical distancing is pictured in the Gallerian in Stockholm, Sweden, May 12.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Henrik Montgomery/TT News Agency/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>There was <a href="https://time.com/5899432/sweden-coronovirus-disaster/">a freedom of information [request</a>, and] a bunch of emails that have been published by journalists in your country that show that Mr. Tegnel said that at one point that when it was suggested that 10 per cent of those who would get the disease would be the elderly and maybe they would die, 10 per cent might be "worth it," he apparently said.

So it hasn't benefited from it, and it has certainly not benefited from the herd immunity.</p>  <p><strong>Today we saw the announcement that citizens in Sweden should avoid places like shopping malls, museums, gyms, concerts, and avoid public transportation or visiting the elderly. So is there a shift perhaps in perception?</strong></p>  <p>There are policies. You know, it's not a completely<em> laissez faire</em>.

<![CDATA[Retool Funding Lesson: You Can Compete with Free When It's B2B]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>Retool has announced that it raised $50M from Sequoia only 2 years after launch for what is essentially a front-end builder. While explaining to a non-developer friend how you can build a business selling something that countless web developers can cobble together out of free open source components, I accidentally busted this rhyme:</p>

<p>You can compete with free,
when it comes to B2B,
because for businesses
no-charge isn’t free</p>

<p>Look at it from a business’s point of view. Let’s say they pay a web developer $100 / hour. If it takes that dev 10 hours to piece together a front end from React, Bootstrap, and several tends of thousands of Javascript packages, that app cost them $1000. The fact that they don’t pay for the open source components is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Now imagine they could get the same app with 2 hours of effort using a tool that costs $100 / month. That $100 tool ends up costing them $-700. Paying up starts to sound like a pretty good deal</p>

<p>There are lots of examples of this economic story playing out if you look for them. Any development team can replicate the essential elements of Algolia with Apache Solr or Elasticsearch, but Algolia is going strong. Open source CMS options abound, but Contentful raised an $80M series E recently.</p>

<p>The big caveat here is that this <em>does not</em> apply in the B2C world. Consumers are famously blind to total cost of ownership, both monetary and intangible (like giving up any semblance of privacy for a ‘free’ navigation app). Free really is nigh on impossible to beat when you are targeting consumers. And the false economy of cheap-but-fragile junk is so compelling that finding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife">things that won’t break in a couple of years is an armchair sport</a>.</p>

<p>Next time your trying to think of a business idea, ask yourself this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are businesses dependent on that they aren’t paying for directly but they are paying dearly for in employee hours?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever answer you come up with, it’s a million dollar idea.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Even though I’m not convinced that <a href="https://davidnoelromas.com/2020/05/13/working-in-public.html">working in public</a> is always useful, I am absolutely certain that being a prolific and also fairly decent (in that order) writer is always useful as an engineer.</p>

<p>Here I’m going to try explaining briefly <em>why</em> I think that is, and then provide some insight into <em>how</em> I approach writing in an engineering context.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>To get better at writing.</strong> Yes, I realize it’s a bit cruel to include this recursive reference at the top of a list. Nevertheless, if you do find yourself believing that writing is a high-leverage activity for engineers, the only way to get better at it is to write often.</li>
  <li><strong>Async is better.</strong> In order to collaborate on any project, we need to communicate with stakeholders. Written artifacts allow this to happen asynchronously, and possibly even over long periods of time. Asynchronous communication is better, not only for remote work but for <em>all</em> work, because (a) assuming that all relevant stakeholders can attend the same meeting at the same time in a big org is bonkers and (b) most (all?) people are not able to provide their best feedback off-the-cuff in a 30 minute meeting stuffed around a conference table.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write lots.</strong> This is the only surefire way to get better at writing, and it’s the main reason I keep things like blogs around. I write a ton at work, but it’s helpful to zoom out a bit periodically and write about different topics/for different audiences. I’m not an <em>amazing</em> writer (yet!), but I keep <a href="https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-7.html">sharpening the saw</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>LNO.</strong> My manager once pointed me to a <a href="https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1223816226918453253">presentation/Tweet storm</a> from a PM at Stripe which changed my approach to work forever. Basically, everything at work can be categorized into “leverage,” “neutral,” and “overhead.” “Leverage” tasks are those which you anticipate getting an outsized ROI on. “Neutral” tasks are those which you anticipate breaking even on. “Overhead” tasks are those which are necessary but low ROI. Your success at work depends on properly identifying which tasks go into which bucket, and investing your time and energy accordingly. My manager and I now have a shorthand that we sometimes use, especially in cases where it seems like we’re not seeing eye-to-eye on the amount of effort a task deserves. Instead of focusing on the concrete issue, we jump into a meta-discussion about how much leverage the task affords—this is usually at the heart of our difference. Once we agree on the importance of a task, it’s easy to agree on the amount of effort it deserves. Anyway, this is <em>extremely</em> important when it comes to writing, since any writing task is effectively unbounded. The LNO framework makes it easier to decide up-front how much effort a writing task deserves. For example, I treat most blog posts as “neutral” at-best, and therefore aim to spend no more than 30 minutes writing them.</li>
  <li><strong>Structure.</strong> A very effective way to get ideas onto a page quickly is to start with the outline and then flesh out each piece. That’s how I wrote this blog post—I wrote the introductory paragraph, and then I added “why” and “how” as headings, and then I added 1-3 word bullet points under each, and then I added a paragraph to those. If this was a “leverage” piece I probably would have started exactly the same way, but then spent more time editing afterwards.</li>
  <li><strong>Templates.</strong> There’s no reason to re-invent structure every time you write. I use all sorts of templates in my writing; some of them are formal enough that the templated structure is still visible in the final artifact (e.g. design docs which always have the same headings) and other times it would be difficult to tell that there was a prescribed structure initially. One framework that I’ve been investigating lately for technical/business writing is <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/how-to-job-guides/scqa/">SCQA</a>.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>The use of fiat currency in our modern society is so accepted that many people will go through their whole life without questioning why the dollar in their pocket has value, or for that matter, why it exists at all.</p>
<p>In this article,&nbsp;we shall seek to answer two basic questions. First, why does paper money exist? Second, why do we readily accept paper money in exchange for our goods and services?</p>
<p>Mainstream economics tends to answer both of these questions by referring to the role of money as a “medium of exchange”. In general terms, economists might argue that paper money exists because it forms a valuable role as a medium of exchange (barter economies are inefficient) and paper money has value because it is accepted as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>While it is true that “money is a medium of exchange”, this is the wrong answer to both of the questions posited above.</p>
<p>The view of The Money Enigma&nbsp;is that fiat money exists because it is a useful financing tool for society. When governments don’t wish to pay their bills by raising more taxes or by issuing more debt, they can simply create money.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason we accept fiat money in exchange for our goods and services is because, as a society, we recognize that money is a financial instrument. More specifically, fiat money represents a proportional claim on the output of our society. This is the way in which fiat money derives its value and this is the reason that fiat money can perform its functions as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.</p>
<p>In simple terms, <em>money is the equity of society</em>. Fiat money exists because it is a useful as a financing tool and it has value because it is a financial instrument (it is a special-form equity instrument of society).</p>
<p>The fact that fiat money is a “medium of exchange” is incidental to its nature. More specifically, fiat money does not derive value from its nature as a medium of exchange. Rather, money can only perform its role as a medium of exchange because it possesses the property of market value, a property that is derived solely from its nature as a financial instrument.</p>
<p>Those that claim that money has value because it is accepted as a medium of exchange are engaging in a circular argument. Why does money have value? It has value because it is widely accepted in exchange. Why is money widely accepted in exchange? It is accepted because it has value.</p>
<p>The problems created by this circular argument are largely ignored by most economists, despite the fact that this circular argument lies at the heart of Keynes’ liquidity preference theory. We will discuss the flaws in liquidity preference theory another time. For now, let’s take some time to explore the two simple questions we started with.</p>
<p><strong>Why does fiat money exist?</strong></p>
<p>The view implied by many textbooks is that fiat money exists because it is a useful medium of exchange. But was creating a medium of exchange the motivation of those who first issued fiat money?</p>
<p>Let’s put that question another way. Do you think that the first kings that issued fiat money did so because they felt that their society needed another “medium of exchange”? Was fiat money just part of a benevolent desire by those rulers to assist commerce? Were these rulers visionaries who saw the long-term benefits to trade of paper money?</p>
<p>The short answer to all three questions is “no”.</p>
<p>Paper money was introduced to pay the bills when the kings ran out of gold.</p>
<p>The kings in our early societies didn’t create paper money because they were worried that gold wasn’t fulfilling its role as an efficient “medium of exchange”. Gold and silver were doing just fine as a medium of exchange. Rather, the issuance of paper money was an act of survival: it offered a mechanism to pay the army when the kingdom was close to running out of gold.</p>
<p>However, there was a trick to this arrangement. In order for this new paper money to be accepted, the king had to convince the people that the money was “as good as gold”. More specifically, the money had to be issued with the explicit agreement that it could be exchanged for a fix amount of gold on request (for example, one ounce per dollar). If people believed that this promise was credible, then the paper money would trade at the same value as its gold equivalent. However, if this promise lacked credibility, then the value of the paper money would soon collapse.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in most cases, this system worked, at least for a while.</p>
<p>Fiat money was issued because it performed a unique role as a financing tool. If the kingdom couldn’t raise taxes and was reaching the limits of its borrowings, then issuing paper money that was backed by gold was an attractive way of financing public expenses.</p>
<p>The point is that fiat money is a financing tool. Originally, fiat money was issued as a financial instrument that promised the bearer a certain amount of gold or silver. This is why fiat money was accepted and why it was considered by all to possess the property of “market value”.</p>
<p>Over time, most modern societies have abandoned the gold standard. Most fiat money is no longer convertible into gold at request. But this hasn’t changed the reason money is issued. Money is a financing tool that. Money is still issued to pay for public activities that we, as a society, don’t wish to pay for with taxes or with the issuance of government debt.</p>
<p>Once you strip away all the technical language, the activities of our modern central banks are simple. When governments wish to manipulate financial markets (most notably, suppressing the interest rate by purchasing government debt), they have three basic choices to fund their debt purchases: raise taxes, issue debt or print money. Issuing debt and using the proceeds to buy back that debt defeats the purpose of the exercise. Raising taxes to buy government debt is not a popular move and is likely to be counterproductive, particularly when the economy is weak. Therefore, the government, through its monetary policy agency (the central bank), issues money to buy its debt. This action lowers the interest rate and everyone is happy.</p>
<p>Once again, nothing has changed. Fiat money is issued to pay for things (buying debt) that the government doesn’t wish to pay for by raising taxes or issuing debt. Fiat money exists because it is a financing tool “par excellence”.</p>
<p>What has changed over time is the way in which fiat money derives its value and this brings us to our second question.</p>
<p><strong>Why does fiat money have value?</strong></p>
<p>If we go back to our earlier example, the reason that fiat money had value in the days of the gold standard is obvious: money was backed by gold.</p>
<p>Gold is a real asset, which is to say that it derives its value from its <em>physical properties</em>.</p>
<p>Fiat money is not a real asset. Rather, fiat money is a financial instrument, which is to say that it derives its value from its <em>contractual properties</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Real assets versus financial instruments" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?resize=624%2C468 624w, https://i2.wp.com/www.themoneyenigma.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Real-assets-versus-financial-instruments.jpg?w=720 720w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>Paper money has no value in and of itself. However, paper money does represent something. In the case of early fiat money, paper money represented an explicit claim to a certain amount of gold or silver. The holder of paper money was a party to a contract that stated that the holder could exchange that piece of paper for something of more tangible value.</p>
<p>The mystery of paper money is why it continued to possess any value once the explicit gold convertibility feature was dropped. Why did paper money continue to have any worth once the explicit contract was rendered null and void?</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom is that money continued to have value because, by that time, it was accepted as a medium of exchange. The problem is that this creates the circular argument that we alluded to earlier.</p>
<p>Money is only accepted as a medium of exchange because it possesses the property of “market value”. If money did not have any value, then it would not function as a medium of exchange (if money had no value, you wouldn’t accept money from me in exchange for your goods/services).</p>
<p>If that basic fact is established, then we can’t also argue that money has value because it is accepted as a medium of exchange. Either money is a medium of exchange because it has value, or it has value because it is a medium of exchange. It can’t be both.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we need is something to break this circular argument. More specifically, we need a better model for explaining why fiat money possesses the property of “market value” when the explicit gold backing is removed.</p>
<p>As discussed, fiat money is not a real asset: it doesn’t derive value from its physical properties. Therefore, fiat money must be a financial instrument: it must derive its value from some sort of contractual arrangement.</p>
<p>The solution is to imagine that when the gold-convertibility feature was dropped, the explicit contract that governed fiat money was replaced by an implied-in-fact contract. In other words, when the gold-convertibility feature was removed, paper money no longer represented an explicit claim to something of value. But, it did still represent an implied claim to something of value: the output of society.</p>
<p>The view developed by The Enigma Series is that money is the equity of society. More specifically, money is a long-duration, proportional claim on the output of society. Money is an economic liability of society, even though it remains a legal liability of government and is issued by government on society’s behalf (society can not issue claims directly because “society” is not a legal entity).</p>
<p>The explicit contract that governed fiat money (gold-convertibility) was replaced by an implied-in-fact contract. This new contract, which is in essence an agreement between every member of society, states that money is a proportional claim on the output of society.</p>
<p>This is a complicated idea, but we can think of it in simple terms.</p>
<p>In essence, money is a much like a share of common stock. A business can issue common stock and each share becomes a proportional claim on the future cash flow of that business. All else remaining equal, …</p></div></div>

October 20, 2020 | https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/10/06/enabling-full-text-search">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>In this post, we will take a legacy application and improve its search
functionality. We will do this with only a few changes to the
application itself. Using a technique called change data capture (CDC)
we will listen for changes in a database and react to these
changes&nbsp;- write to a search index case. Before writing to the
search index, we will also enrich the data with a natural language
processing (NLP) step that extracts keywords from a text description.</p>
<p>We might want to use an external search index for various reasons,
especially:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to provide more feature-rich functionality than full-text search in a
relational database;</p></li>
<li><p>to scale the search independently of the database;</p></li>
<li><p>to add more functionality (keyword extraction) to the application
without
modifying it - making changes to a legacy application is sometimes
risky, or time-consuming, so taking this approach might be faster,
therefore cheaper.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this tutorial we will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use Hazelcast Jet - an open-source stream processing system - and its CDC
module to read changes made to the application database for further
processing in a Jet pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Jet pipeline, we will enrich the data with an NLP mapping step.</p></li>
<li><p>Write the results to an Elasticsearch index, using an Elasticsearch
connector, <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/14/jet-42-is-released">released in Jet 4.2</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-architecture.png" alt="Architecture"></p>
<h2>The Application</h2>
<p>We chose the <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring
PetClinic</a>
application. It is relatively well-known to many Java developers and is
rather similar to a typical enterprise application.</p>
<p>The application provides a management tool for managing pets, their
owners, and visits to vets. It allows searching for owners, but only
using the owner’s last name. We will make the search more feature-rich,
allowing us to search on first name, last name, pet names and keywords
extracted from descriptions of the visits.</p>
<p>First, let’s start a vanilla version of the application. Run the
following command to start MySQL database inside a Docker container, we
use the official MySQL image, which allows us to create a database for
the pet clinic application easily:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-mysql -it \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql \
  -p 3306:3306 mysql
</code></pre>
<p>Clone the pet clinic application source code from
<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic">Github</a> (this is a
fork of the official <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring PetClinic
repository</a> with a
branch containing the changes we will make later for your convenience).</p>
<pre><code>git <span>clone</span> https://github.com/hazelcast-demos/spring-petclinic.git
</code></pre>
<p>Start the pet clinic application from the command line by running the
following command:</p>
<pre><code><span>cd</span> spring-petclinic
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mysql
</code></pre>
<p>And wait for the following log message:</p>
<pre><code>2020-09-30 16:17:04.113  INFO 24847 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.s.petclinic.PetClinicApplication     : Started PetClinicApplication in 3.177 seconds (JVM running for 3.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owners in top-level menu</p>
<p>-&gt; Click Find Owner button to list all data</p>
<p>and you should see a screen similar to the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://jet-start.sh/blog/assets/2020-10-06-spring-petclinic-list.png" alt="Spring PetClinic Sample Application"></p>
<h2>Prepare for Change Data Capture</h2>
<p>In order to stream the changes from the MySQL database we need to modify
certain settings and grant more permissions to the <code>petclinic</code> user.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start MySQL client, enter the <code>mysql</code>
password for the root user:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it --rm --link petclinic-mysql:petclinic-mysql mysql mysql -hpetclinic-mysql -uroot -p
</code></pre>
<p>Run the following to grant privileges to the <code>petclinic</code> user to allow
listening to the database changes:</p>
<pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>USER</span> petclinic <span>IDENTIFIED</span> <span>WITH</span> mysql_native_password <span>BY</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> RELOAD <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>CLIENT</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>REPLICATION</span> <span>SLAVE</span> <span>ON</span> *.* <span>TO</span> <span>'petclinic'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ALTER USER</code> command changes the default authentication method to
one supported by the Jet CDC connector. The <code>GRANT</code> commands allow the
petclinic user to stream changes from the database in the same way as
during master-slave replication.</p>
<h2>Start Elasticsearch</h2>
<p>We want to enable full-text search across multiple fields, but not all
fields. With Elasticseach we need to create an index mapping that
copies fields into a single field, the field is then used for searching.</p>
<p>Run the following command to start Elasticsearch inside a docker
container:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name petclinic-elastic \
  -e discovery.type=single-node \
  -e cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled=<span>false</span> \
  -p9200:9200 elasticsearch:7.9.2
</code></pre>
<p>Create an Elasticsearch index mapping by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code>curl -XPUT -H <span>"Content-type: application/json"</span> -d <span>'
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "first_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "last_name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.name": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "pets.visits.keywords": {
        "type": "text",
        "copy_to": "search"
      },
      "search": {
        "type": "text"
      }
    }
  }
}'</span> http://localhost:9200/petclinic-index
</code></pre>
<p>The default setting of Elasticsearch analyzer is suitable for us. For
more elaborate configuration of the text analysis, you should look into
the Elasticsearch documentation or some other source.</p>
<h2>Hazelcast Jet Job</h2>
<p>Now that we have the Petclinic and Elastic set-up and working, we can
start the data pump - a Jet job reading change events from MySQL
database and writing into the Elastic index.</p>
<p>A Jet job is a pipeline of steps that read, modify, aggregate or store
data items. The job definition is written in Java and packaged as a jar
file. The jar file is deployed to a Jet cluster, which takes care of the
execution, scaling, fail-over and other operational aspects.</p>
<p>The job consists of 4 main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CDC Source connecting to MySQL database</p></li>
<li><p>A mapping step running the keyword extraction</p></li>
<li><p>A joining step reconstructing the document from change records from</p></li>
<li><p>different tables</p></li>
<li><p>Elasticsearch sink</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>CDC Source</h3>
<p>The configuration of the source is straightforward, just set the required
parameters:</p>
<pre><code><span>StreamSource</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> source <span>=</span> <span>MySqlCdcSources</span>
    <span>.</span><span>mysql</span><span>(</span><span>"mysql"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseAddress</span><span>(</span>databaseAddress<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePort</span><span>(</span>databasePort<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseUser</span><span>(</span>databaseUser<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabasePassword</span><span>(</span>databasePassword<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setClusterName</span><span>(</span>clusterName<span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setDatabaseWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>setTableWhitelist</span><span>(</span><span>"petclinic.owners"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.pets"</span><span>,</span> <span>"petclinic.visits"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use the source to read change events from MySQL into the pipeline:</p>
<pre><code><span>Pipeline</span> p <span>=</span> <span>Pipeline</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>StreamStage</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>ChangeRecord</span><span>&gt;</span></span> allRecords <span>=</span> p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
                                        <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>Keyword extraction</h3>
<p>The next step in the pipeline is to extract the keywords from the visit
description. We will use Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE)
algorithm, the implementation we use was originally published on
<a href="https://github.com/Linguistic/rake">Github</a>. The implementation is not
important for the demonstration, you could use any other Java library,
call a 3rd party service, e.g. via <a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/how-tos/grpc">grpc</a> or use our
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/docs/tutorials/python">python integration</a>.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>ServiceFactory</span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>?</span><span>,</span> <span>Rake</span><span>&gt;</span></span> keywordService <span>=</span> <span>ServiceFactories</span><span>.</span><span>sharedService</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>context<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Rake</span><span>(</span><span>"en"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

p<span>.</span><span>readFrom</span><span>(</span>mysqlSource<span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>withoutTimestamps</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
 <span>.</span><span>mapUsingService</span><span>(</span>keywordService<span>,</span> <span>PetClinicIndexJob</span><span>::</span><span>enrichWithKeywords</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The method <code>enrichWithKeywords</code> simply passes the description field from
the change record to the keyword extraction service and sets the results
into the keywords field of the Visit instance.</p>
<p>It is a common pattern to enrich an item in a pipeline with more
information.  Hazelcast Jet works with POJOs in the pipeline, so you
need to somehow compose the original item and the enriching information.
One option is to use tuples.  This works for a small number of fields.
Another option would be to use a domain-specific object holding all the
information - e.g. the <code>keywords</code> field.  If you are on Java 14 or
newer, you might want to give the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359">Records preview
feature</a> a try.</p>
<h3>Joining</h3>
<p>Change data capture sends changes to the database as individual records
(represented by
<a href="https://jet-start.sh/javadoc/4.2/com/hazelcast/jet/cdc/ChangeRecord.html">ChangeRecord</a>).
Each record represents a changed row in a database table. If a single
row is all that you need, you are good to go. You can see such example
in our <a href="https://jet-start.sh/blog/2020/07/16/designing-evergreen-cache-cdc">Evergreen Cache blog
post</a>.  But having a
single row to work with is not always the case - often you need to
aggregate either multiple records from the same table or join records
from different tables into a single aggregate record.</p>
<p>In our case, we need to join 3 tables into a single document, which we
then index into Elasticsearch. To perform the joining we will use
<code>mapStateful</code> step. This can be performed either globally or partitioned
on a grouping key. If all your records share a common key it is always a
good idea to do the grouping by the key, because the mapping state is
then evenly distributed across all nodes and the mapping operation
parallelized.</p>
<p>Our visit record contains the pet ID but not the owner ID, in such case,
so we don’t have a single grouping key for all records. There are two
options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>perform the stateful mapping globally, which has the advantage of
having a single state - the joining logic is simpler and the pipeline
more straightforward. The obvious disadvantage is that such a solution
is not scalable because the state may not fit onto a single member and
must be performed by a single thread;</p></li>
<li><p>create two separate mapping steps - one grouped on the owner ID and
the other on the pet ID. This is a trade-off between simplicity and
scalability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are several observations which hold for both implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the mapping state must cover all data from the beginning, unless there
is a domain-specific rule that would allow eviction of old items;</p></li>
<li><p>the records might arrive in any order, even if there is a foreign key
between the records in the database, the order is not guaranteed, this
is a property of CDC.</p></li>
<li><p>once the object is emitted from the join step, it must not be
modified, otherwise the later stages might see it in inconsistent
state, causing issues which are hard …</p></li></ul></span></p></div></div></div>

What is your background? what is your current position?</h2><p id="b291">Iâ€™ve always been interested in systems programming, and after obtaining my CS degree I got the opportunity to start a PhD at Ghent University, Belgium, right when Julia was first released around 2012. The language seemed intriguing, and since I wanted to gain some experience with LLVM, I decided to port some image processing research code from MATLAB and C++ to Julia. The goal was to match performance of the C++ version, but some of its kernels were implemented in CUDA Câ€¦ So obviously Julia needed a GPU back-end!</p><p id="7f14">That was easier said than done, of course, and much of my PhD was about implementing that back-end and (re)structuring the existing Julia compiler to facilitate these additional back-ends. Nowadays Iâ€™m at Julia Computing, where I still work on everything GPU-related.</p><h2 id="8f7f">What is JuliaGPU? What is the goal of the project?</h2><p id="43d9">JuliaGPU is the name we use to group GPU-related resources in Julia: Thereâ€™s a <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU" rel="noopener">GitHub organization</a> where most packages are hosted, a <a href="https://juliagpu.org/" rel="noopener">website</a> to point the way for new users, we have <a href="https://github.com/JuliaGPU/gitlab-ci" rel="noopener">CI infrastructure</a> for JuliaGPU projects, thereâ€™s a Slack channel and Discourse category, etc.</p><p id="ceaa">The goal of all this is to make it easier to use GPUs for all kinds of users. Current technologies often impose significant barriers to entry: CUDA is fairly tricky to install, C and C++ are not familiar to many users, etc. With the software we develop as part of the JuliaGPU organization, we aim to make it easy to use GPUs, without hindering the ability to optimize or use low-level features that the hardware has to offer.</p><h2 id="5da7">What is GPU computing? How important is it nowadays?</h2><p id="4de0">GPU computing means using the GPU, a device originally designed for graphics processing, to perform general-purpose computations. It has grown more important now that CPU performance is not improving as steadily as it used to. Instead, specialized devices like GPUs or FPGAs are increasingly used to improve the performance of certain computations. In the case of GPUs, the architecture is a great fit to perform highly-parallel applications. Machine learning networks are a good example of such parallel applications, and their popularity is one of the reasons GPUs have become so important.</p><h2 id="f596">Do you think Julia is an appropriate language to efficiently use GPU capabilities? Why?</h2><p id="775f">Juliaâ€™s main advantage is that the language was designed to be compiled. Even though the syntax is high-level, the generated machine code is<br>compact and has great performance characteristics (for more details, see <a href="http://janvitek.org/pubs/oopsla18b.pdf" rel="noopener">this paper</a>). This is crucial for GPU execution, where we are required to run native binaries and cannot easily (or efficiently) interpret code as is often required by other languageâ€™s semantics.</p><p id="b90b">Because weâ€™re able to directly compile Julia for GPUs, we can use almost all of the languageâ€™s features to build powerful abstractions. For example, you can define your own types, use those in GPU arrays, compose that with existing abstractions like lazy "Transpose" wrappers, access those on the GPU while benefiting from automatic bounds-checking (if needed), etc.</p><h2 id="824e">From a Python programmer perspective, how does CUDA.jl compare to PyCUDA? Are their functionalities equivalent?</h2><p id="cf3f">PyCUDA gives the programmer access to the CUDA APIs, with high-level Python functions that are much easier to use. CUDA.jl provides the same, but in Julia. The `hello world` from PyCUDAâ€™s home page looks almost identical in Julia:</p><pre><span id="a986">using CUDA</span><span id="03e4">function multiply_them(dest, a, b)<br> i = threadIdx().x<br> dest[i] = a[i] * b[i]<br> return<br>end</span><span id="9e7d">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="5833">dest = similar(a)<br>@cuda threads=400 multiply_them(dest, a, b)</span><span id="1372">println(dest-a.*b)</span></pre><p id="396f">Thereâ€™s one very big difference: "multiply_them" here is a function written in Julia, whereas PyCUDA uses a kernel written in CUDA C. The reason is straightforward: Python is not simple to compile. Of course, projects like Numba prove that it is very much possible to do so, but in the end those are separate compilers that try to match the reference Python compilers as closely as possible. With CUDA.jl, we integrate with that reference compiler, so itâ€™s much easier to guarantee consistent semantics and follow suit when the language changes (for more details,<br>refer to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03112" rel="noopener">this paper</a>).</p><h2 id="5cf6">Are the packages in the JuliaGPU organization targeted to experienced programmers only?</h2><p id="6590">Not at all. CUDA.jl targets different kinds of (GPU) programmers. If you are confident writing your own kernels, you can do so, while using all of the low-level features CUDA GPUs have to offer. But if you are new to the world of GPU programming, you can use high-level array operations that use existing kernels in CUDA.jl. For example, the above element-wise multiplication could just as well be written as:</p><pre><span id="9c1f">using CUDA</span><span id="476a">a = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))<br>b = CuArray(randn(Float32, 400))</span><span id="efdf">dest = a .* b</span></pre><h2 id="4c26">Is it necessary to know how to code in CUDA.jl to take full advantage of GPU computing in Julia?</h2><p id="208b">Not for most users. Julia has a powerful language of generic array operations ("map", "reduce", "broadcast", "accumulate", etc) which can be applied to all kinds of arrays, including GPU arrays. That means you can often re-use your codebase developed for the CPU with CUDA.jl (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965997818310123" rel="noopener">this paper</a> shows some powerful examples). Doing so often requires minimal changes: changing the array type, making sure you use array operations instead of for loops, etc.</p><p id="672d">Itâ€™s possible you need to go beyond this style of programming, e.g., because your application doesnâ€™t map cleanly onto array operations, to use specific GPU features, etc. In that case, some basic knowledge about CUDA and the GPU programming model is sufficient to write kernels in CUDA.jl.</p><h2 id="1a33">How is the experience of coding a kernel in CUDA.jl in comparison to CUDA C and how transferable is the knowledge to one another?</h2><p id="6a08">Itâ€™s very similar, and thatâ€™s by design: We try to keep the kernel abstractions in CUDA.jl close to their CUDA C counterparts such that the programming environment is familiar to existing GPU programmers. Of course, by using a high-level source language thereâ€™s many quality-of-life improvements. You can allocated shared memory, for example, statically and dynamically as in CUDA C, but instead of a raw pointers we use an N-dimensional array object you can easily index. An example from the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/using-shared-memory-cuda-cc/" rel="noopener">NVIDIA developer blog</a>:</p><pre><span id="ef8a">__global__ void staticReverse(int *d, int n)<br>{<br> __shared__ int s[64];<br> int t = threadIdx.x;<br> int tr = n-t-1;<br> s[t] = d[t];<br> __syncthreads();<br> d[t] = s[tr];<br>}</span></pre><p id="9cb0">The CUDA.jl equivalent of this kernel looks very familiar, but uses array objects instead of raw pointers:</p><pre><span id="996c">function staticReverse(d)<br> s = @cuStaticSharedMem(Int, 64)<br> t = threadIdx().x<br> tr = length(d)-t+1<br> s[t] = d[t]<br> sync_threads()<br> d[t] = s[tr]<br> return<br>end</span></pre><p id="9a14">Using array objects has many advantages, e.g. multi-dimensional is greatly simplified and we can just do "d[i,j]". But itâ€™s also safer, because these accesses are bounds checked:</p><pre><span id="3d65">julia&gt; a = CuArray(1:64)<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> â‹®<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64</span><span id="0d9c">julia&gt; @cuda threads=65 staticReverse(a)<br>ERROR: a exception was thrown during kernel execution.<br>Stacktrace:<br> [1] throw_boundserror at abstractarray.jl:541</span></pre><p id="c17a">Bounds checking isnâ€™t free, of course, and once weâ€™re certain our code is correct we can add an "@inbounds" annotation to our kernel and get the high-performance code we expect:</p><pre><span id="6846">julia&gt; @device_code_ptx @cuda threads=64 staticReverse(a)<br>.visible .entry staticReverse(.param .align 8 .b8 d[16]) {<br> .reg .b32 %r&lt;2&gt;;<br> .reg .b64 %rd&lt;15&gt;;<br> .shared .align 32 .b8 s[512];</span><span id="09c9">mov.b64 %rd1, d;<br> ld.param.u64 %rd2, [%rd1];<br> ld.param.u64 %rd3, [%rd1+8];<br> mov.u32 %r1, %tid.x;<br> cvt.u64.u32 %rd4, %r1;<br> mul.wide.u32 %rd5, %r1, 8;<br> add.s64 %rd6, %rd5, -8;<br> add.s64 %rd7, %rd3, %rd6;<br> ld.global.u64 %rd8, [%rd7+8];<br> mov.u64 %rd9, s;<br> add.s64 %rd10, %rd9, %rd6;<br> st.shared.u64 [%rd10+8], %rd8;<br> bar.sync 0;<br> sub.s64 %rd11, %rd2, %rd4;<br> shl.b64 %rd12, %rd11, 3;<br> add.s64 %rd13, %rd9, %rd12;<br> ld.shared.u64 %rd14, [%rd13+-8];<br> st.global.u64 [%rd7+8], %rd14;<br> ret;<br>}</span><span id="4489">julia&gt; a<br>64-element CuArray{Int64,1}:<br> 64<br> 63<br> 62<br> â‹®<br> 3<br> 2<br> 1</span></pre><p id="3cee">Tools like "@device_code_ptx" make it easy for an experienced developer to inspect generated code and ensure the compiler does what he wants.</p><h2 id="164a">Why does having a compiler have such an impact in libraries like CUDA.jl? (How was the process of integrating it to the Julia compiler?)</h2><p id="e360">Because we have a compiler at our disposal, we can rely on higher-order functions and other generic abstractions that specialize based on the arguments that users provide. That greatly simplifies our library, but also gives the user very powerful tools. As an example, we have carefully implemented a `mapreduce` function that uses shared memory, warp intrinsics, etc to perform a high-performance reduction. The implementation is generic though, and will automatically re-specialize (even at run time) based on the arguments to the function:</p><pre><span id="9da7">julia&gt; mapreduce(identity, +, CuArray([1,2,3]))<br>6</span><span id="c680">julia&gt; mapreduce(sin, *, CuArray([1.1,2.2,3.3]))<br>-0.11366175839582586</span></pre><p id="52e8">With this powerful `mapreduce` …</p></div></div></section></div>

<h2><strong>A waterfall of old-schoolness&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p>I worked as a developer using Waterfall for exactly 9 months. I was 22 years old and it was my first programmer job and first corporate environment. This place was old school. Like suit-wearing, personal cubicle type old school. Our CEO would hold all-hands meetings where everyone was required to stand the whole time and he would call people up to give speeches at random because he believed everyone should be good at public speaking.&nbsp;</p>

<figcaption>22 year old Dan was NOT good at public speaking 🙂&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>







<p>At one offsite event, the CEO designated me as the company Complaint Manager. During the 4-day event employees were directed to give me their complaints. Of course my friends dropped anonymous and hilarious complaints because they knew that, at the end of each day, I was going to be called up to the stage to repeat back all of the complaints. What?!? Super old school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One time, I was sent to work at a client’s office for a week, just so they could visibility see my team working on their project. And I mean that in the most literal sense. We didn’t have any meetings or recent project updates, they just wanted to make sure we were actually working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I never saw a single line of my code in production during my 9 months I spent working there. I actually remember learning that my project was finally being sent to QA for testing the week I left. After 9 months. Old. School.</p>



<p>But I didn’t know any better at the time. I hadn’t heard of Agile yet, and no one told me we were doing Waterfall. Luckily I got out of there and found a job at Cloudlock where I learned about Agile and eventually worked my way up to VP of Engineering. But I’ll never forget my first year as a Waterfall programmer.</p>



<p>So does methodology matter? Absolutely. But…&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>We do agile… But</strong></h2>







<p>If you ask a software developer&nbsp; what methodology they follow, 95% of us will say we do agile…but, usually followed by some version of Scrum or Kanban. While this sounds like a worldwide consensus, the reality is that every dev team I’ve worked on or managed has had a different development process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During my time as VP of Engineering at Cloudlock, I looked after 75 developers across 5 teams. Each team had their own unique process. There were team leads who had been working in software development for 25+ years and others that had <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/promoted-from-dev-to-team-lead-8-things-they-didnt-tell-me/">just gotten promoted</a>. The younger leads liked having a more strict process to follow, whereas the more senior managers had a process they had customized over the years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of those teams built amazing software even though their methods differed per team. Why? Because software development is not a zero sum game. Just because one team is successful using Agile Scrum doesn’t mean another team will be less successful using Agile Kanban. Or Scrumban. Or SAFe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a lot of options out there so, instead of focusing on methodology, I find it makes sense to start with what you’re trying to do and work backwards.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>A bespoke development process – The GigSmart dev team&nbsp;</strong></h2>







<p><em>“You got rid of teams?!?”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>I recently caught up with my friend Chris Downard, VP of Engineering at GigSmart, to chat about dev methodology changes in light of current events. I was completely taken aback when the first thing he said to me was that he just got rid of teams in his engineering department.&nbsp;</p>







<figure><picture>

<img src="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png" alt="" srcset="https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-1024x488.png 1024w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-300x143.png 300w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology-768x366.png 768w, https://linearb.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-Blog-Methodology.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">
</picture>
</figure>







<p>I’m not personally strict about following this or that development method, but getting rid of teams felt a little extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris: “It naturally evolved that way. Because of this remote culture that we adopted very rapidly, we just found that the back end people tended to support each other on their backend tickets; whether or not it was on their direct team or a direct feature they were working on. They were helping each other, committing to each other’s code, etc. So we kept the team thing going up until last month, and we were measuring that way, so we just eliminated it because it didn’t make sense anymore.”</p>



<p>Getting rid of teams works for Chris for two reasons. He runs a small-ish team of 14 developers and the team uses a Kanban style framework. If there are 3 or 4 features in flight, each team member is assigned to one as their dominant project, but they’re all on one team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the classic Scrum ceremonies are still followed, but he’s working on making them more effective as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do one large standup and it takes us 15 minutes to get through. People give their standup updates in order based on their dominant feature. So the first set of people who go, are the ones who are working on Feature A, and the second group that goes are all working on Feature B.”</p>



<p>On top of no teams and restructuring their daily, Chris says they work in sprints but use a Kanban board to increase speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The product team loves that because if they decide that something is suddenly really hot because sales has run into this or that, we can address it immediately.”</p>

<h3><strong>Why does GigSmart work this way?&nbsp;</strong></h3>







<ul><li>Chris believes in continuous improvement based on team feedback.</li></ul>







<p>When he runs sprint retros, anything that engineering brings up that isn’t working, they have a conversation about. He brings in product and they chat about ways to make it better, and then they test it. And if it doesn’t work, he readjusts, and tries to fix it. Since he started at GigSmart, there hasn’t been a 4 week period where their process has stayed the same.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="2"><li>GigSmart’s most valuable outcome is speed.</li></ul>







<p>The methodology, process, or ethos that drives your team needs to be purpose built to achieve the outcome you want. At GigSmart they’re defined outcome was high quality and speed. As an on-demand staffing platform, they choose to prioritize hotfixes and bugs. Other companies might need to be more predictable, quality-driven, stable, consistent, etc. based on their business type and needed outcome.</p>







<ul start="3"><li>GigSmart is culture-driven&nbsp;</li></ul>







<p>“Build better, more engaged engineering teams… That’s probably what my actual official job description is. So culture really matters.” <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/our-dev-culture-is-based-on-bushido-samurai-code-my-interview-with-the-vp-of-engineering-at-gigsmart/">Chris and GigSmart CTO,&nbsp; Jason Waldrip, modeled their team cultural values</a> on the ancient samurai code of Bushido. 8 values that they’ve written down and strive to live and work by every day.&nbsp;</p>







<ul start="4"><li>GigSmart is data-driven</li></ul>







<p>Measuring is not enough, you have to measure with a purpose. You get what you measure. Everyone is familiar with this saying. Chris takes it a step further and actually encourages the team to look data about how they work in all of their day-to-day practices and ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By defining his company’s most valuable outcome and listening to his developers, Chris has created a development process that is bespoke to his team today. Just like a custom tailored suit, his development method cannot be easily used by another company. It had to be made up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<h2><strong>Make up your own dev methodology: 4 guiding ideas</strong></h2>

<p>Sometimes I just like building my own thing from the ground up. It’s why I started <a href="https://linearb.io/">LinearB.</a> Do you NEED to create your own development method? Definitely not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s much easier to start with Scrum or Kanban and adapt from there. But times, they are a changin’, and maybe this is a good year to go through the exercise of redefining how you work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After we started full-time remote back in March, my co-founder, Ori Keren, and I did just that. We created <a href="https://linearb.io/blog/asynchronous-development/">Asynchronous Development</a>, a development methodology designed around async communication and purpose-built for hybrid remote teams. It’s our favorite parts of Agile. A little bit of Scrum. A lot of what Ori and I learned over the years that really works for us. And a big dose of where we think the future of software development teamwork is headed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hundreds of teams are now following the Async Dev methodology. If we can make up our own dev methodology, you can too!&nbsp;</p>







<p><strong>Here’s 4 guiding ideas that will help you make up your own dev methodology</strong></p>







<ol><li><strong>Know your “why”&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>







<p>What matters to you? If it’s aligning to your company’s most important business goals, do you&nbsp; know what they are? Start-ups tend to want lots of new features as quickly as possible. More mature companies like predictability and quality. Find out and work backwards from there.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="2"><li><strong>Don’t be dogmatic</strong></li></ol>







<p>Forget about the rules and just ask yourself… “How do we really want to work?” Ask your people. Especially your out-of-the-box thinkers. The more crazy ideas you throw in the mix, the more discussion you’ll create and the more you’ll end up with something that is really bespoke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, the Agile manifesto says face-to-face communication is the most efficient way to transfer information. Is that still true for your team?</p>







<ol start="3"><li><strong>Retro your current process</strong></li></ol>



<p><strong><br></strong>Ask… “Why are we doing all of these things we do every day?” Do you really need a daily stand-up? Do you really need two week sprints? Are you realy getting value from them? The answer may be yes. But I bet if your team will have a lot of ideas of how they could be more dev-friendly and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>







<ol start="4"><li><strong>Bring data to the conversation&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>







<p>After you’re done exploring all of the pain from step 3, see if you can prove or disprove any of the assumptions and anecdotes with actual data. This might be the hard part, actually. The type of data you need is not necessarily accessible in your Git or project management system. If you need help, check out LinearB.

<p><strong>What’s your made up methodology?</strong></p>







<p>I know many of you have already customized your own dev methodology. I’d love to hear about it! What pieces of existing methods did you use? What new things did you invent? What is special about your approach? Please …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">


<p>In one particular context.</p>


<p>A while back, a colleague wanted to make a major change in the design of a system, the sort of change that was going to take a year or more, and many tens of person-years of effort. They asked me how to justify the project. This post is part of the email reply I sent. The advice is in context of technical leadership work at a big company, but perhaps it may apply elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right solution?</strong></p>

<p>I like to pay attention to ways I can easily fool myself. One of those ways is an <em>availability heuristic</em> applied to big problems. I see a big problem that needs a big solution, and am strongly biased to believe that the first big solution that presents itself is the right one. It takes intentional effort to figure out whether the big solution is, indeed, a solution to the big problem. Bold action, after all, isn't a solution itself.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes, in one of his more exuberant or desperate moods, Pa would go out in the veld and sprinkle brandy on the daisies to make them drunk so that they wouldn't feel the pain of shriveling up and dying. (André Brink)</p></blockquote>

<p>Because I am so easily fooled in this way, I like to write my reasoning down. Two pages of prose normally does it, building an argument as to why this is the right solution to the problem. Almost every time, this exposes flaws in my reasoning, opportunities to find more data, or other solutions to explore. Thinking in my head doesn't have this effect for me, but writing does. Or, rather, the exercise of writing and reading does.</p>

<p>The first step is to write a succinct description of the problem, and what it means for the problem to be solved. Sometimes those are quantitative goals. Speeds and feeds. Sometimes, they are concrete goals. A product launch, or a document. Sometimes, it's something more qualitative and harder to explain. Thinking about the problem bears a great deal of fruit.</p>

<p>Then, the solution. The usual questions apply here, including cost, viability, scope and complexity. Most important is engaging with the problem statement. It's easy to make the exercise useless if you disconnect the problem statement from the solution.</p>

<p>It is important you feel comfortable with the outcome of this exercise, because losing faith in your own work is a sure way to have it fail. Confidence is one valuable outcome. Another one is a simpler solution.</p>

<p><strong>Is it the right problem?</strong></p>

<p>An elegant solution to the wrong problem is worse than no solution at all, at least in that it might fool people into thinking that the true problem has been solved, and to stop trying. You need to deeply understand the problem you are solving. Rarely, this will be an exercise only in technology or engineering. More commonly, large problems will span business, finance, engineering, management and more. You probably don't understand all of these things. Be sure to seek the help of people who do.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Once I think I understand multiple perspectives on a problem, I like to write them down and run them by the people who explained the problem to me. They'll be able to point out where you're still wrong. Perhaps you're confusing your net and operational margins, or your hiring targets make no sense, or your customers see a different problem from you. This requires that the people you consult trust you, and you trust them. Fortunately, non-engineers in engineering organizations are always looking out for allies and friends. Most are, like engineers, only too excited to explain their work.</p>

<p><strong>Engage with the doubters, but don't let them get you down</strong></p>

<blockquote><p>Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you (Tom Lehrer)</p></blockquote>

<p>You will never convince everybody of your point of view. By now, you have two powerful tools to help convince people: A clear statement of the problem that considers multiple points-of-view, and a clear statement of the solution. Some people will read those and be convinced. Others would never be convinced, because their objections lie beyond the scope of your thinking. A third group will have real, honest, feedback about the problem and proposed solution. That feedback is gold that should be mined. Unfortunately, separating the golden nuggets of feedback from the pyrite nuggets of doubt isn't easy.</p>

<p>The doubters will get you down. Perhaps they think the problem doesn't exist, or that the solution is impractical. Perhaps they think you aren't the person to do it. Perhaps they think the same resources should be spent on a different problem, or a different solution. You'll repeat, repeat, and repeat. Get used to it. I'm still not used to it, but you should be.</p>

<p>Again, writing is a tool I reach for. "Today, I'm doubting my solution because..." Sometimes that doubt will be something more about you than the project. That's OK. Sometime it'll be about the project, and will identify a real problem. Often, it'll just point to one of those unknown unknowns that all projects have.</p>

<p><strong>Meet the stakeholders where they are</strong></p>

<p>Most likely, you're going to need to convince somebody to let you do the work. That's good, because doing big things requires time, people and money. You don't want to be working somewhere that's willing to waste time, people or money. If they're willing to waste time on your ill-conceived schemes, they'll be willing to waste your time on somebody else's ill-conceived schemes.</p>

<blockquote><p>May your wisdom grace us until the stars rain down from the heavens. (C.S. Lewis)</p></blockquote>

<p>The best advice I've received about convincing stakeholders is to write for them, not you. Try to predict what questions they are going to ask, what concerns they will have, and what objections they will bring up and have answers for those in the text. That doesn't mean you should be defensive. Don't aim only to flatter. Instead, tailor your approach. It can help to have the advice of people who've been through this journey before.</p>

<p>The previous paragraph may seem to you like <em>politics</em>, you may have a distaste for politics, or believe you can escape it by moving to a different business. It is. You may. You can't.</p>

<p>Leadership willing to engage with your ideas and challenge you on them is a blessing.</p>

<p><strong>Build a team</strong></p>

<p>You need to build two teams. Your local team is the team of engineers who are going to help you write, review, test, deploy, operate, and so on. These people are critical to your success, not because they are the fingers to your brain, but because the details are at least as important as the big picture. Get into some details yourself. Don't get into every detail. You can't.</p>

<p>Your extended team is a group of experts, managers, customer-facing folks, product managers, lawyers, designers and so on. Some of these people won't be engaged day-to-day. You need to find them, get them involved, and draw on them when you need help. You're not an expert in everything, but expertise in everything will be needed. Getting these people excited about your project, and bought into its success, is important.</p>

<p>Finally, find yourself a small group of people you trust, and ask them to keep you honest. Check in with them, to make sure your ideas still make sense. Share the documents you wrote with them.</p>

<p><strong>Be willing to adapt</strong></p>

<p>You will learn, at some point into doing your big project, that your solution is bullshit. You completely misunderstood the problem. You may feel like this leaves you back at the beginning, where you started. It doesn't. Instead, you've stepped up your level of expertise. Most likely, you can adapt that carefully-considered solution to the new problem, but you might need to throw it out entirely. Again, write it down. Be specific. What have you learned, and what did it teach you? Look for things you can recover, and don't throw things out prematurely.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aside from software development, I also enjoy studying other related fields like marketing, project management, and product management.</p><p>Any reasonably sized software needs planning to be executed properly and after you "finish it" (a software product is never actually "done"), you need to market it to the public in order to make sales.</p><p>In this article, I will describe the process I took to become a Project Management Professional (PMP) by the Project Management Institute (PMI), one of the most sought certifications, not only in project management but in the market as a whole.</p><p>I was able to start my studies and take the test successfully in 2 months, studying between 3 and 4 hours a day, every day, weekends included, and get the results below:</p><p>Overall performance:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-overall-performance.png" alt="Initial"></p><p>Performance by domain:</p><p><img src="https://renanmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/pmp-exam-breakdown.png" alt="Initial"></p><h2>What is the PMI and the PMP?</h2><p>The PMI (Project management institute) is the main organization when you think about project management.</p><p>Project Management varies a lot from place to place, from project to project, and from industry to industry, but there are some standards across all of those that are considered general best practices.</p><p>The PMI publishes the PMBoK (Project Management Body of Knowledge), which is a guide of best practices in project management.</p><p>The PMBoK is <strong>not</strong> a methodology, the project team needs to decide which processes will be applied according to their needs.</p><p>The PMBoK is usually updated every 4 or 5 years with new practices and a review of the current ones.</p><h2>PMP Certification requirements</h2><p>To apply for the test, you have to meet some criteria as described by the official PMI page:</p><ul><li>A four-year degree</li><li>36 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p><strong>OR</strong></p><ul><li>A high school diploma or an associate’s degree (or global equivalent)</li><li>60 months leading projects</li><li>35 hours of project management education/training or CAPM® Certification</li></ul><p>You can find everything you need to know about the application and the certification process itself on the official page of the exam at <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">Project Management Professional (PMP)®</a>.</p><h2>What do you need to prepare</h2><p>I had 3 things at hand to prepare:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.pmi.org/pmbok-guide-standards/foundational/pmbok">The PMBoK</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PMP-Exam-Prep-Eighth-Updated/dp/1932735658">Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</a></li><li>An exam simulator</li></ul><h3>The PMBoK</h3><p>This is PMI’s official resource to study. In a sense, it contains everything you need regarding topics.</p><p>The problem is that the PMBoK alone is a little too dry to study for the exam and it doesn’t have exercises to practice.</p><p>This is simply because the PMBoK is a reference book, not a study guide.</p><p>The best way to get a copy is to register as a PMI Associate. As an associate, you get a free copy of the PMBoK and you also get a good discount on the exam fee.</p><h3>Rita Mulcahy’s PMP Exam Prep</h3><p>This is the book you want to have with you as your best friend.</p><p>Unlike the PMBoK, Rita’s book is a written course to help you organize ideas and absorb the topics of the exam with questions at the end of each chapter.</p><p>This one is a must, although kind of expensive, but not so much if you compare it with a live or online course that might cost you thousands of dollars instead of a few hundred like the book.</p><p>And the book has a huge advantage compared to a course: you can resell the book to somebody else and recover most of the investment you made or you can even buy a used copy from someone and save a buck.</p><h3>Exam simulator</h3><p>I did the exam back in 2018 and the simulator I used is no longer available, so I won’t recommend any specific simulator because I only recommend things I have used and can guarantee they actually work.</p><p>You can search for a "PMP exam simulator" on the internet and find lots of them.</p><p>Look for reviews to find a good one, these might be pricey, but they are worth it if you want to pass the exam.</p><p>A good simulator should allow you to practice questions by specific areas, so you can focus on one at a time when studying.</p><p>And, of course, they must have a good enough amount of questions so you can practice at least 2 complete exams, similar to the one you are actually going to take on the test day.</p><h2>How to study</h2><p>You might not be able to take the exam in 2 months and that’s ok! Actually, most people take between 3 and 6 months of study before taking the exam.</p><p>I will describe the process I used to study, each person has a rhythm and different constraints in life, so adapt this to a schedule you can actually keep.</p><p>1 – Read Rita’s book in parallel with the PMBoK, then answer the questions at the end of each chapter of Rita’s book.<br> 2 – Once a week, at least, answer questions on the exam simulator by area. Do not attempt to mix questions of many areas at first, let each one sink in.<br> 3 – Review the areas in which you are not scoring well in the simulator. You don’t need a perfect score and a good simulator will tell you where you should focus to get better.<br> 4 – Repeat steps 1,2, and 3 until you finish all the chapters in Rita’s book.<br> 5 – As soon as you feel comfortable, try as many complete exams simulator as you can, I would say something between 2 and 4 are enough.</p><p>I did 2 complete exams, on two different days, a week before the test.</p><p>You mustn’t let anyone distract you, lock yourself in a room and simulate the environment of the test so you get a feel of how to behave on the test day and how to manage your time appropriately.</p><h2>The exam day</h2><p>If you followed all steps described before and had good scores on the simulator, don’t worry, you are good to go!</p><p>Just one last tip: don’t get stuck on a question.</p><p>The exam is 4 hours long and has 200 questions, this means you have, on average 1.2 minutes per question!</p><p>Some questions will feel easier, some will feel harder, that’s normal, no one has all the answers, if you feel stuck on one question mark it for later and review it at the end if you have some time left.</p><p>Prepare well, keep calm, and good luck!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><h4><em>Manage the content of your Next.js apps through a free Git-based CMS</em></h4><p>If you’re starting a new React project, you might want to consider <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> and <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>. In this article, we take a look at why this would be a great choice and walk through the process of setting up a new project using these technologies.</p><h2>Why Next.js?</h2><p>As I stated in <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-set-up-next-js-with-typescript-5f912766c88">a previous article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“There are many important details you need to consider when you start a new project with React. Your code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.</p><p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">Create React App</a> can be a nice tool to handle this for you and give you a massive head start, but what about code-splitting, pre-rendering for performance, and SEO or server-side rendering?</p><p>To build a complete React application, you need more than CRA provides you with. You can save yourself some time by using Next.js, a React framework that provides a solution to all of these problems.”</p></blockquote><p>If you want to read more about CRA vs. Next.js, check out <a href="https://codeburst.io/stack-choices-create-react-app-vs-next-js-f0f3c4db7083">Stack choices: Create React App vs Next.js</a>.</p><h2>Why Netlify CMS?</h2><p><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a> is an open-source Git-based content management system. It is based on client-side JavaScript and handles content updates directly in Git. Because all content is just stored in your Git repository, you don’t need to have anything hosted on a server. It’s completely free and a great fit to combine with Next.js to build landing pages or blogs that are manageable through a nice UI.</p><h2>Let’s Begin</h2><p>Let’s begin building our landing page with some basic text to get familiar with Netlify CMS. You can find the source code of this part of the tutorial <a href="https://github.com/jakeprins/nextjs-netlify-cms">on GitHub</a> or check out <a href="http://serverless.page/">serverless.page</a> for a complete boilerplate that also includes features like authentication and billing.</p><h3>Set up your project</h3><p>You can start by creating a new Next.js project with <code>npx create-next-app</code>. In this example, we are going to use TypeScript. You can follow <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-set-up-next-js-with-typescript-5f912766c88">this tutorial</a> on how to set up Next.js with Typescript.</p><h2>Using Markdown Files for Our Content</h2><p>Netlify CMS works with markdown files, and it’s a great way to manage the content of your landing page or blog. Let’s begin by creating a markdown file that will have some data we want to show on our home screen.</p><p>Make a <code>content</code> directory that will hold all our markdown files. Next, create a <code>pages</code> directory and a markdown file called <code>content/pages/home.md</code>. This file will hold the data that we want to show on our home page. Let’s start by adding a title, description, and image for the “hero” section of our landing page:</p><pre><code><span>--</span><span>-</span><span>
</span><span>hero_title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Build</span><span> a </span><span>SaaS</span><span> faster </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>
</span><span>hero_description</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Serverless</span><span> </span><span>SaaS</span><span> is aiming to be the perfect starting point </span><span>for</span><span> your next </span><span>React</span><span> app to build full</span><span>-</span><span>stack </span><span>SaaS</span><span> applications</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Visit</span><span> serverless</span><span>.</span><span>page</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> more info</span><span>.</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>--</span><span>-</span></code></pre><p>Next, we need to tell webpack how to load markdown files. Let’s use <code>frontmatter-markdown-loader</code> for this. Start by installing that package as a dev dependency:</p><pre><code><span>yarn add frontmatter</span><span>-</span><span>markdown</span><span>-</span><span>loader </span><span>-</span><span>D</span></code></pre><p>Next, create a new <code>next.config.js</code> file at the root of your project with the following content:</p><h3>Create the home page</h3><p>Cool, now let’s add some code to the index page to make it our home page.</p><p>In <code>pages/index.tsx</code>, add the following:</p><p>Let’s have a look at what’s going on here. The most important part is the exported <code>getStaticProps</code> function. If you export an <code>async</code> function called <code>getStaticProps</code> from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by <code>getStaticProps</code>.</p><p>On our page, we import our markdown file called <code>home.md</code> and pass it a <code>content</code> prop to our component. Our home page can now use the <code>hero_title</code> and <code>hero_description</code> attributes of the markdown file.</p><p>Let’s try it out and see if it’s working:</p><pre><code><span>yarn dev</span></code></pre><p>You should see your amazing hero section, ready to be styled and managed with your upcoming CMS.</p><h2>Implement Netlify CMS</h2><p>There are different ways to add Netlify CMS to your project. We are going to use the official npm package:</p><pre><code><span>yarn add netlify</span><span>-</span><span>cms</span><span>-</span><span>app</span></code></pre><h3>Add the configuration</h3><p>Before we can initialize our CMS, we need to create a config file. Create a <code>cms</code> directory at the root of your project and paste the following configuration to your <code>cms/config.js</code>:</p><pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  cms_manual_init</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>,</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Netlify CMS has different options on how to handle authentication. We are going to use this config file to tell Netlify CMS that we want to use the GitHub for this. For repositories stored on GitHub, the <code>github</code> back end allows CMS users to log in directly with their GitHub account. Note that all users must have push access to their content repository for this to work.</p><p>If you haven’t done already, now would be a good time to <a href="https://github.com/new">create your repository on GitHub</a>, add the name of your repo to the config file, and push your code to GitHub. Go ahead — I’ll wait.</p><p>Good, but before we move on, let’s take a look at the most important setting of our configuration: the <code>collections</code>. This determines how content types and editor fields in the UI generate files and content in your repository.</p><p>Inside <code>collections</code>, we create a <code>pages</code> collection that has some settings for the <code>home</code> page. For now, we only added the <code>hero_title</code> and <code>hero_description</code> fields. You can set which <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets/#header">widget</a> to use for the given property.</p><p>You can read about all other configuration options <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options">in the documentation</a>.</p><h3>Initialize the CMS</h3><p>Next, let’s create an admin page for our CMS. Add the following code to <code>pages/admin.tsx</code>:</p><pre><code><span>import</span><span> </span><span>dynamic</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>'next/dynamic'</span><span>;</span><span>

</span>
<span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>AdminPage</span><span>;</span></code></pre><p>Now you should be able to navigate to <a href="https://localhost:4202/">http://localhost:3000/admin</a> and see a GitHub login button. Hit the button and see your nice new CMS!</p><img alt="Blank CMS" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*sCq_bD6q9UjrCg-YhKpL_A.png" width="1058" height="369"><h3>Try it out</h3><p>Cool, now try it out! Select “Home” and you will see the edit page. You can edit the <code>hero_title</code> and <code>hero_description</code> properties and click the <code>publish</code> button. When you publish, Netlify CMS is making a commit to your repository with the changes you just made. You can take a look at the last commit after you have published some changes.</p><p>Now, all you have to do is <code>git pull</code> to get those changes locally and navigate back to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. You will see that the home page contains your changes. Sweet!</p><h2>Adding Images</h2><p>Most hero sections contain a pretty image. Let’s use the <code>image</code> widget to add an image to our hero section. Go to your <code>cms/config.js</code> file and add the following object to the <code>fields</code> array:</p><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  label</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Hero Image'</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>  name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'hero_image'</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>  widget</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'image'</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Next, we could simply add an image to our <code>public/img</code> folder and add it to our <code>home.md</code>, but to demonstrate how Netlify CMS works, we are going to use the CMS to do it.</p><p>First, we need to upload an image to our integrated media library. On the dashboard of the CMS, click the “Media” link in the top navbar and upload an image. After that, navigate to the edit screen of the home page.</p><p>You should now see the added <code>hero_image</code> field with a button that says, “Choose an image.” You can now select your uploaded image and publish the changes.</p><p>Great, we should now have a new commit to our repo with the new changes. If our application was already in production, we could see the changes live, but since we want to see these changes locally, we need to first pull them from GitHub.</p><p>After you have run <code>git pull</code>, there is really only one thing left to do, which is adding the image to our home page:</p><pre><code><span>...</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>img src</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>attributes</span><span>.</span><span>hero_image</span><span>}</span><span> alt</span><span>=</span><span>'hero image'</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>...</span></code></pre><p>Now, run <code>yarn dev</code> and go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a> to see your added image!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Netlify CMS is a very useful library you can add to your Next.js apps. It’s just a client-side React application, and it uses Git to store content in your own repository. This has some nice benefits: You don’t need to host your CMS separately and it fits perfectly in your Git workflow. This is great for managing the content of a landing page or blog post.</p><p>If you are looking for a complete boilerplate, check out <a href="http://serverless.page/">serverless.page</a>.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>We have covered a lot in this tutorial, but we have only seen the basics of how Netlify CMS works in a Next.js application.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <div>
  <div>
    <p>Due to the nature of the app here, I want to start this blog post with a disclaimer:</p>
    <p>This describes a <em>minor</em> security flaw in the app which has no impact on its ability to function as part of a track &amp; trace system. I also want to be explicitly clear that this bug does not have any privacy impact whatsoever. Lastly, there is nothing nefarious about this bug. It's a mistake (largely on the part of a third-party dependency) and nothing more, one that is easily (and commonly) made.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>The NHS COVID-19 Android app, the official contact tracing app for England and Wales, uses signed JWT tokens for its “scan into a venue” feature but does not properly validate the signatures, meaning anyone could have forged their own venue QR codes.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is due to a mixture of JWTs being fundamentally difficult to verify correctly, and a particularly awful JWT library API.</p>

<p>I was able to discover the vulnerability from reading the source code, and getting the relevant app code running on my computer in a test harness to experiment with it.</p>

<p>I reported the vulnerability to the NHS team who fixed it very quickly.</p>

<h2 id="the-full-story">The Full Story</h2>

<p>It all started, as many things do, with <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361">a Tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>okay i actually really wanted to know and its a JWT with</p><p>like</p><p>the whole dang address</p><p>and the name of the place just for shits and giggles <a href="https://t.co/1vx0bTD9zi">pic.twitter.com/1vx0bTD9zi</a></p></div>— laura mcflurry (@freezydorito) <a href="https://twitter.com/freezydorito/status/1309606987198607361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2020</a></blockquote>


<div><p>For those of you who don't know, these QR codes are for venues (such as pubs and bars) to display so customers can check in via the NHS (National Health Service) mobile app. This makes it faster and more convenient to track who was at the venue, in case they need to be contacted in the event someone else there tested positive for Coronavirus.</p></div>

<p>For whatever reason, the NHS venue QR codes are JWTs, and they are cryptographically signed.</p>

<p>Like anyone in security, as soon as I heard the letters “JWT” I thought: “I wonder if they got the signature checking correct”.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: they didn’t:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle.png"><img src="https://www.zofrex.com/assets/nhs-app-check-in-barnard-castle-thumb.png" alt="A screenshot of a mobile phone app: Green check mark. Title: Successful check-in. Large text: Barnard Castle Eye Testing Facility. Smaller test: 30 Sep 2020, 12:53. Thank you for scanning. You have now checked in! You'll be automatically checked out at midnight or when you scan another official NHS QR code. Button: Back to home. Link: Cancel this check-in."></a></p>

<h2 id="background-jwts--signing">Background: JWTs &amp; Signing</h2>

<p>In case you don’t know what a JWT is, it’s an entirely unnecessary and rather over-complicated spec for encoding data in JSON format and: cryptographically signing it, so it cannot be altered; encrypting it, so it cannot be read; both; or – popularly (if accidentally) – neither.</p>

<p>This post is about signed JWTs, and forging signed JWTs, so I’m not going to mention encryption any more. From here on in, every time I say “JWT” I mean “unencrypted, but possibly signed, JWT”.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know everything about JWTs to follow along here, but you do need to know this much: A JWT consists of three parts: a , a <span>payload</span>, and a <span>signature</span> (optional). Here’s an example:</p>

<pre>.<span>eyJuYW1lIjoiem9mcmV4IiwibWVzc2FnZSI6ImhlbGxvLCB3b3JsZCEifQ</span>.<span>40IhxsQj3rVqfQSpdzZTroSs1onXrTJUsy6yC1SadK0</span></pre>

<p>Each part is Base64 encoded, which isn’t important here, and decoded it looks like this:</p>

<pre>.<span>{"name":"zofrex","message":"hello, world!"}</span>.&lt;<span>inscrutable crytographic soup&gt;</span></pre>

<p>The header tells whoever is verifying the JWT which cryptographic algorithm was used to sign it (“alg”), and optionally an identifier for the key it was signed with (“kid”).</p>

<p>There are a number of problems that JWTs are shoe-horned into being a solution for, and one very common one is for verifying data that is passed between services by an untrusted user. For example, service A produces a token and gives it to a user, who then presents the token to service B. Because the token is round-tripping through the user, it is important to make sure they haven’t altered it (or created it themselves), and the token really was generated by the first service.</p>

<p>In the context of the NHS App, “service A” is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/create-coronavirus-qr-poster">website that generates QR codes for venues to display</a>, and “Service B” is the NHS COVID-19 app. There are actually multiple untrusted users carrying the QR code from service A to service B: the venue owner who prints out the QR code and sticks it up on the wall, and any customers who scan the QR code with their phone. Because of the cryptographic signature, the app can verify that the QR code it scans really was created by the official website.</p>

<p>That’s the theory.</p>

<p>In security and cryptography circles, JWTs used in this way are practically synonymous with “alg=none” bugs. Remember that “alg” field in the header earlier? One of the options is “none”. This, as you may have guessed already, means no verification occurs. This has proven to be the single biggest footgun in the JWT specification, as despite seemingly being a very obvious trap to avoid, many JWT libraries out there hide these details from users and make it very easy to accidentally allow the “none” algorithm.</p>

<p>The bottom line here is that this is <a href="https://www.howmanydayssinceajwtalgnonevuln.com/">hilariously and depressingly common</a>, and well worth double-checking if you are investigating any system that uses JWTs or, heaven help you, building one. That’s why this was my first thought upon learning the NHS app uses JWTs, and why I wanted to check if they made this specific mistake.</p>

<h2 id="lets-take-a-look">Let’s Take A Look</h2>

<p>Both the NHS apps (Android and iOS) <a href="https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/article/KA-01157/en-us?parentid=CAT-01028&amp;rootid=CAT-01024">are open source</a>, so it’s very easy for someone like me –&nbsp;more accustomed to reading/writing source code than reverse engineering – to take a look. A quick search for “JWT” in each repo later and we find:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-ios-ag-public/blob/a15cebbda5c073f1e0f7b266105110d0d88a7b27/NHS-COVID-19/Core/Sources/Domain/CheckIn/Model/QRCode.swift">The iOS app</a>:</p>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(I’ve omitted code not relevant to the signature checking)</p>

<p>This looks fine. Sure, it’s a little bit weird to do the key checking yourself rather than defer to a JWT library for it. But on the other hand, it’s extremely obvious reading this code that it’s doing the right thing, at least as far as alg=none avoidance goes (I cannot vouch for the cryptography, however. I’m just an alg=none expert).</p>

<p>The key part here is that the signing algorithm is hardcoded to P256, so setting alg to “none” in the JWT itself will have no effect on verification. Additionally the key to use is also hardcoded: it’s passed in to the class via the constructor. The “kid” (key id) field in the JWT is <em>checked</em>, but ultimately thrown away. The JWT is not trusted to choose the algorithm or the key, and in that sense this is a great example of how to safely use JWTs, if you do absolutely have to use them.</p>

<p>Lastly, the payload of the JWT is not decoded or used at all until after the signature is verified. This isn’t really relevant to the alg=none issue, but it is good practice in general to only access signed data after verifying that it hasn’t been tampered with. In cryptography, this protects you from <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">clever cryptographic attacks</a>. With JWTs it ensures you don’t accidentally use attacker-provided data for any decisions in your code if the signature fails, and has a side-benefit of creating a layered defence to exploiting the JSON parser (historically a decent source of bugs).</p>

<p>Anyway, this code looks fine. Great! <a href="https://github.com/nhsx/covid-19-app-android-ag-public/blob/2e37797b9b7b5db5b393280a9ef8b93a19af4964/app/src/main/java/uk/nhs/nhsx/covid19/android/app/qrcode/QrCodeParser.kt">On to Android</a> (again, I’ve omitted irrelevant code):</p>

<p>Phew, there’s a lot more going on here! Let’s break it down:</p>

<p>We start in the <code>parse</code> function and after some basic data juggling, we parse the JWT. Then we check if the signature is correct, and if it isn’t, we bail:</p>

			<p><em>Abstract: A few weeks ago, Orca Security published a comparison between the Orca Cloud Security Platform and a few other cloud security tools—including a&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">comparison with Palo Alto Networks Prisma</a>. In response, Palo Alto Networks sent a <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cease and desist letter</a>, demanding the comparison be removed immediately. Here is my response. I urge you to see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDnqJTEi6ynvsGkSJHYeEmhz6_NfzKgbf">the videos in question</a>&nbsp;and if you, like me, believe the cybersecurity community deserves transparency and vendors shouldn’t be allowed to prevent publishing reviews or benchmarks via legal threats, then please share this post. You can also leave your own comments down below.</em></p>
<p><strong>To: Palo Alto Networks</strong></p>
<p><strong>CC: The cybersecurity community</strong></p>
<p><strong>Subject: The Cybersecurity community demands transparency, not legal threats&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Security has always been about transparency. The concept of security by obscurity was frowned upon as early as 1851—even before the invention of electricity—when&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Charles_Hobbs">Alfred Hobbs</a>, a Massachusetts-based locksmith, demonstrated how then state-of-the-art locks could be picked. He explained that exposing the information would make the public more secure, as rogues already knew the deficiencies. The public needed to be educated, and he’d pursue better locks. Today’s locks are more advanced, but the principle is the same.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity community preaches about many products. All come with their own advantages and disadvantages, capabilities, and limitations. I believe that the only way practitioners can choose the tools that fit their environments best is by viewing factual evidence—not by relying solely on marketing materials. This is why we launched our&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/cloud-security-solutions/">Cloud Security Punch-Out! Series</a>, where we deploy a few tools—including Orca Security—on the exact same environment and share the results with viewers who deserve to see them. I urge you to take&nbsp;<a href="https://orca.security/prisma-cloud-security/">a look at the one we did with Palo Alto Networks;</a>&nbsp;as you’ll see we don’t hide those areas where Palo Alto Networks shines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Palo Alto Networks is now trying to use legal threats to prevent us from publishing&nbsp;these video&nbsp;reviews. In <a href="https://orca.security/wp-content/uploads/PANW-Legal-Letter-Cease-Desist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its letter</a>, Palo Alto Networks does not point to any factual inaccuracies in the reviews of its products’ performance. Instead, it premises its threats on flimsy, boilerplate contract terms that prohibit reviews and comparisons of its products and hollow trademark allegations purporting that Palo Alto Networks is sponsoring the videos.</p>
<p>It’s outrageous that the world’s largest cybersecurity vendor (its products being used by over 65,000 organizations according to its website), believes that its users aren’t entitled to share any benchmark or performance comparison of its products. According to its boilerplate contract terms that prohibit “disclosing, publishing, or otherwise making publicly available any benchmark, performance, or comparison tests” of its products, you’re in violation even if you publish the results of an internal comparison of Palo Alto Networks against other products as part of your procurement process. The same goes for the hundreds of Palo Alto Networks reviews on various sites that include G2 Crowd, Capterra, and Gartner Peer Insights. It means that only benchmarks approved by Palo Alto Networks can be published.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks appears oblivious to the fact that the New York Attorney General’s office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/2003579195misc2d3841519">sued and won an injunction</a>&nbsp;against McAfee from enforcing its contractual restrictions against publishing reviews or comparisons of its products without its consent more than 17 years ago. In enacting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45b">Consumer Review Fairness Act</a>, Congress has also prohibited businesses from including contract terms that prohibit consumers from reviewing products or services they purchase.</p>
<blockquote><p>Palo Alto Networks, do you think your products are flawless or that the bad guys will follow along, not openly talking about products’ deficiencies? If the answer is no to both, then why resort to legal threats to remove such benchmarks and comparisons? I refuse to accept a world where any vendor believes it has the right to prevent the free flow of information, and control which product reviews are made publicly available.</p></blockquote>
<p>I urge you to make your products better and focus your marketing efforts on demonstrating that, rather than throwing away money on ill-conceived gag efforts. Such action doesn’t benefit anyone. If you believe we missed something in our test, then tell us so we can make adjustments—we’ll happily integrate your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p>We could contract an objective third party to conduct additional tests. You could conduct your own tests with Palo Alto Networks and Orca Security’s products, then let the audience see and decide for themselves. All such actions would be far more beneficial to the industry, permitting both companies to learn and improve our products for the sake of customers.</p>
<p>As we all recently learned too well,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/news/sunlight-inactivates-the-airborne-virus-that-causes-covid19">sunlight is the best disinfectant</a>. The cybersecurity community deserves better than a vendor’s lack of transparency while wielding dubious legal methods. Palo Alto Networks is the worlds’ largest cybersecurity vendor; with great power comes great responsibility. Your products are great—but nothing is perfect, and the public should have free access to all of the facts.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br>
Avi Shua, CEO and Co-Founder<br>
Orca Security</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I find myself with a bit of excess time on my hands, now that I’m between jobs. Given that, I’ve found a few more challenging pedals to tear into and analyze.</p><p>First of these: the Boss GE-7 graphic equalizer pedal. This is a real standard, no-frills EQ pedal, and a real common selection among guitarists.</p><p>If you haven’t had a chance to look at the writeups for other pedals I’ve analyzed, those are available here:</p><ul><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-boss-ge7-equalizer/">Simulating the Boss GE-7 Graphic Equalizer in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-schaller-tremolo/">Simulating the Schaller Tremolo Pedal in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-dunlop-crybaby/">Simulating the Dunlop Crybaby Wah Pedal in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/ltspice-proco-rat/">Simulating the ProCo RAT Distortion Pedal in LTSpice</a></li><li> <a href="http://cushychicken.github.io/posts/ltspice-tube-screamer/">Simulating the TS808 Tube Screamer in LTSpice</a></li></ul><p><strong><em>Also!</em></strong> I’d love to help analyze a particular pedal you’re interested in learning about. Got a particular effect you know and love? Send me a schematic and I’ll see what I can do.</p><p>​</p><p>If you’d like to follow along at home, the LTSpice schematic, as per usual, is <a href="https://github.com/Cushychicken/ltspice-guitar-pedals">up on GitHub</a>. This time, I’d recommend you pull down a copy. This design is too big to show the whole thing in detail in one picture!</p><p>The GE-7 input stage is a AC coupled noninverting amplifier, set for 10x gain, and biased to a 4.5V operating point through R49. This bias is maintained at AC through C24 coupling to the 4.5V bias rail. Introduces a Zero into the circuit near 2.2kHz - high frequencies are <em>greatly</em> amplified</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The input amp here is nominally a Hitachi preamp circuit optimized for low input noise. I’m substituting an LT1211 here, as the precise part it’s not essential for understanding circuit function. I had suspected that maybe the HA1457W was a better performer on some audio parameter - THD, or perhaps input noise - but inspection of the datasheet shows that’s simply not the case. Even with a 12.5 [nV/rtHz] noise rating, the LT1211 measures out to an input voltage noise of 7.8 uVrms across a 2Hz - 22kHz bandwidth. On its worst day, even accounting for gain, that would still whip the HA1457W’s <em>typical</em> noise rating of 53uV.</p><p>I’d be curious to understand how this pedal measures out at -100dB A-weighted noise, but that’s a task for another day - one where I’ve got an AP and a spare EQ pedal handy.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020161132368.png" alt="GE-7 Input Buffer"></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I’m substituting the LT1211 here as a stand-in for the nominal uRC4558. I’ve done this before in the TS808 model with some success - the opamp isn’t doing anything special besides providing a high impedance input/low impedance output for subsequent stages.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603221036690.png" alt="GE-7 Volume Level Stage"></p><p>The level sweep is controlled by a low-corner RC filter (R3 + C2 with fc = 7.2Hz) connected to the center wiper of a potentiometer. Short the wiper to the Vol_Input node, and that lowpass filter shunts most of the energy at Vol_Input to GND.</p><p>Short the wiper in the opposite direction to the inverting opamp node, and something interesting happens. At signal frequencies (i.e. above 7.2Hz), the opamp starts to see a 5:1 divider formed by R54 and R3. The result of this is a ~15dB boost at the Vol_Level output.</p><p>Without this potentiometer, the GE-7 volume level stage is a pretty standard unity gain buffer. With the added RC filter on the potentiometer tap, however, it’s a cheap and easily controllable level stage.</p><h2 id="equalizer-summing-amp">Equalizer Summing Amp</h2><p>The equalizer stage starts with a relatively simple summing amplifier…</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020154212484.png" alt="image-20201020154212484"></p><h2 id="equalizer-bank-1">Equalizer Bank</h2><p>…but branches out rapidly into a rather large bank of Sallen-Key filters.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603220690131.png" alt="Image"></p><p>We’ll zoom into the first of these Sallen-Key filters so we’re not trying to read from high altitude.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603220733649.png" alt="Image"></p><p>A slightly less academic term for this topology of Sallen-Key filter is a <em>gyrator</em>. Gyrators are opamp circuits that simulate inductors. The following diagram is a really simple first-pass approximation of what this looks like. (I got lazy and didn’t connect the opamp rails. Sue me.)</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603221751243.png" alt="Gyrator Equivalent Circuit"></p><p>You’ll note that this RLC circuit forms a convenient little second-order bandpass filter. Adding another resistor to the input inverts this behavior, making it a <em>bandstop</em> or <em>notch filter.</em></p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020153829183.png" alt="Bandpass to Notch"></p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020153932147.png" alt="Frequency - Bandpass vs Notch"></p><p>Having taken that little detour into gyrators, we can apply what we know about this gyrator circuit with what we know about a linear pot shorting two terminals in an opamp buffer.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603222862594.png" alt="Image"></p><p>The connection to the linear potentiometer is easier to see with a little redraw, and some annotations. Look familiar?</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020154924404.png" alt="Redraw - RLC EQ with Summing Amp"></p><p>The idea here is that this is <em>basically the same circuit</em> as the input volume control. You’re just changing out the volume level’s first order RC wiper for the equalizer’s second order RLC wiper.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020155056333.png" alt="Equalizer vs Volume Level"></p><p>As a result, you get approximately the same behavior:</p><ul><li>Short the gyrator RLC to Eq_Input, and you cut that frequency bank by ~15dB</li><li>Short the gyrator RLC to Eq_Feedback, and you boost that frequency bank by ~15dB</li></ul><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020163611692.png" alt="Value Sweep - 100Hz Gyrator"></p><p>The steps above show the possible frequency cuts or boosts for the 100Hz EQ bank. The behavior is essentially the same for all of the other filter banks - they are just shifted in frequency to the center of the RLC circuit.</p><p>A valid question after all of this simulation rigamarole: why bother? Why not just get a regular old inductor instead of dealing with all of this gyrator nonsense?</p><p>It’s a good question. It wouldn’t be done this way unless there was a good reason to do so. Let’s look at the 200Hz gyrator notch for our answer:</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603222814960.png" alt="Single Inductor"></p><p>The equivalent inductance here, from our earlier equation, is: \[L = R_{1} * R_{2} * C_{2} = 82[k\Omega ]*330[\Omega]*33[nF] = 0.89 [H]\]</p><p>An inductor rated to 0.89 Henries is a <em>huge</em> inductor, both in value and in physical size. Take, for example, the common mode chokes in any given AC/DC power supply. These are <em>big</em> inductors, typically rated in the tens of millihenries, and will easily occupy a 2 centimeter cube. I couldn’t even begin to estimate they physical size of an inductor that’s rated an order of magnitude higher than these. (I’ll leave that as an exercise to you, the reader, to find on DigiKey.)</p><p>In any case, a 2 cubic centimeter part is not gonna fly in an effects pedal. Remember - there are six of these circuits in the GE-7, which has an enclosure size of 13 cm by 7 cm by 5.5cm. I’d be surprised if you could get six inductors that size in the <em>box</em> - and, since we’re looking at the 200Hz notch, that’s not even the biggest inductor value in the design!</p><p>Besides size, you have to remember tolerance values. It’s hard to source big inductors with tighter tolerances than 20%. On the other hand, it’s easy (and cheap) to source 1% resistors and 5-10% capacitors. Correspondingly, it’s way easier to use those tighter-tolerance parts to yield a tighter-tolerance notch.</p><p>I’d also wager that, on net, it’s way cheaper to design with gyrators than with inductors. Chip vendors typically give price breaks at roughly logarithmic volumes. Thus, the faster you can buy 1k, 5k, or 10k pieces of a given silicon device, the cheaper your per-unit design becomes. That gets way easier when you’re buying multiple components per assembly. By using three dual TL022 opamps per design, it’s easier to get a scalable cost savings in your pedal designs. You only need to build ~350 GE-7s to achieve a cost savings from 1k volume pricing of TL022s. You’d likely need to sell a thousand pedals to get a price break from a similar inductor vendor - provided, of course, that those inductor vendors give pricing breaks at 1k volumes!</p><p>The bypass circuitry is a common design from Ibanez and Boss effects pedals.</p><h2 id="jfet-swithces">JFET Swithces</h2><p>A pair of JFETs AC coupled to the outputs of U2 (equalizer output) and U9 (the dry input signal) form the switch bank that determines whether the pedal output is Equalizer, or simply Bypass.</p><p>One channel is activated at a time by pulling either Effect_Gate or Bypass_Gate to GND. That shorts the corresponding output Bypass_Switch, and sends the audio signal to the output stage.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/Image-1603220859201.png" alt="Image"></p><p>Full disclosure: I typically cut out J2 and short Effect_Out to Bypass_Switch for the purposes of simulation. The reason? I’m lazy, and I haven’t taken the time to figure out a way to automatically disable the control circuitry in LTSpice when the sim starts up. I’d love to know a method for this if you have a trick up your sleeve.</p><h2 id="bistable-switch">Bistable Switch</h2><p>This is the control for JFETs J2/J3.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020163134819.png" alt="Bistable Switch"></p><p>It’s designed so that a specific startup sequence occurs when power is applied to the pedal:</p><ul><li>The base of Q1 is pulled up to V9P0 thru D1. This turns on Q1, pulling Effect_Gate low and shuts off J2.</li><li>Q1 turning on, in turn, pulls down the base of Q2. This shuts off Q2, pulling Bypass_Gate high.</li></ul><p>All this means is that, when power is applied, the pedal naturally comes up in Bypass mode. You have to trigger the switch to turn the equalizer on.</p><p>Full disclosure: I don’t know a great way to have this trigger Sw_Activate in the simulation startup. Like I said in the previous section, I typically cut out the JFETs when simulating. I’d love to spend a little time analyzing the click/pop of that circuit switchover once I figure out a good way to do so.</p><p>The output buffer is a bog-standard AC coupled emitter follower, of the kind we’ve come to know and love. R63 + C31 + R62 form a lowpass filter with fc = 2.2kHz. This forms a pole that compensates the zero at 2.2kHz from the input stage, flattening the pedal’s frequency response above 2.2kHz.</p><p><img src="http://cushychicken.github.io/assets/images/image-20201020164430482.png" alt="GE-7 Output Buffer"></p><p>The <a href="https://www.hobby-hour.com/electronics/s/ge7-equalizer.php">Hobby Hour Schematics page</a> has a big list of effects pedals that I’ve been sourcing schematics from. I used that page as a reference for this schematic design and its component part numbers.</p><p>I also had a look in my copy of Douglas Self’s <em>Small Signal Audio Design</em> for a good explanation of graphic EQ circuits. If you’ve got a copy laying around, it’s on pages 447-450 of the Second Edition.</p><p>If you don’t have a copy of Self’s book, you can always have a look at Rod Elliot’s page on <a href="https://sound-au.com/articles/gyrator-filters.htm">active filters using gyrators</a>. It’s an epic and thorough read on the topic.</p><p>Further reference for AC coupling Sallen Key filters (a.k.a. gyrators) was taken from TI’s app note, <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa096/sloa096.pdf">More Filter Design on a Budget</a>. A handy reference for the cheapskate audio hobbyist, along with <a href="https://nanopdf.com/download/filter-design-on-a-budget_pdf">its predecessor</a> (served here by NanoPDF, as apparently the original was taken down by TI).</p><p>The Geofex forum also has a great description of <a href="http://www.geofex.com/Article_Folders/bosstech.pdf">the dry/effect chain switching in Ibanez and Boss …</a></p></div></div>

<p>I’ve been in and around eng hiring for the past 13 years, as an engineer, a recruiter, and a founder of a technical recruiting marketplace (interviewing.io). Over the course of those 13 years, I’ve become increasingly disgruntled at the state of hiring, and now I’m mad enough to write this blog post.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever been on either end of the table, you’re probably mad at the state of hiring, too. Whether you have given it a lot of thought or whether you just feel it deep down, something about the whole process feels off.</p>



<p>But we’ve been doing it this way for so long that we probably take much of how hiring works as gospel, and it’s really hard to tease apart all the different components of the process and examine why they are the way they are. In this post, I’d like to challenge many of the things we assume about hiring, and, perhaps most importantly, I’d like to lay out my platonic ideal for how eng hiring should work. It’s a simple axiom, really:</p>



<p><em>It should be easy for smart people to talk to other smart people.</em></p>



<p>Or, another way to put it … if I’m a good engineer, it should be easy for me to talk to a hiring manager at a company I might be interested in, at a time of my choosing. But that’s simply not possible today. Despite the refrain that we’re in a candidate’s market and that there’s a shortage of good candidates, which should mean that candidates should have the power to call the shots, today’s hiring process couldn’t be further removed from this ideal. And it’s not just broken for a specific type of candidate. It’s broken for <em>everyone.</em></p>



<p>If you’re reading this, you might be an engineering manager, a senior engineer with stellar credentials, a recent bootcamp grad, an engineer from a background traditionally underrepresented in tech, or some combination of these. <strong>What’s truly messed up about the status quo is that, regardless of which of these groups you fall into, your journey will be unnecessarily unpleasant. Though the degree of unpleasantness will not always be the same, it’s not about race, seniority, pedigree, or gender … or even which side of the table you’re on. Hiring, in its current incarnation, is broken for everybody.</strong></p>



<p>Why? Let us go then, you and I, into the bowels of the status quo.</p>



<h2>A candidate and a hiring manager, never the twain shall meet</h2>



<p>Let’s say that I’m a competent generalist engineer who looks good on paper, and I’m thinking that it’s time to look for a new job. What happens next? The idea of having to mount a full-on job search is so daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could try some job boards to see which companies are out there. But what would I filter on? I know a lot of programming languages but am not set on having to work in a specific one. How can I tell if I’ll hit it off with the team? I’m applying via a job board to a position I know next to nothing about — will anyone even respond?</p>



<p>Suppose I find some companies where I might want to work. If I’m lucky enough to know someone there, I’ll have to get them to refer me, even though that may not actually do much to speed things along. And if I don’t know anyone there, applying will be an exhausting long shot. Odds are no one will look at my application, and having to redo my resume — or worse, write cover letters — seems like the most tedious kind of busywork.</p>



<p>I guess I can always dig through the recruiter spam I’ve gotten. But do those recruiters still work at the company? If they do, how long will it actually take to get into the process?</p>



<p>Breaking character for a moment, a friend of mine recently got this recruiting email from Google, who has elevated gaslighting to an art form: somehow the fact that it takes two months to get through their process has become a <em>selling point.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="319" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-750x319.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-450x191.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail-768x327.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Fwd__Hello_From_Google__-_aline_interviewing_io_-_Interviewing_io_Mail.png 1004w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>Once I do get into the process, why do I have to endure the same intro call ten times with different recruiters who can’t tell me anything about what I’d be working on at any level of depth?</p>



<p>Do I join some platform, create a profile that I copy-paste everywhere (with writing that was just as painful as the aforementioned resume/cover letter) and sort of hope that decent companies contact me … only to have to begin the same recruiter calls over and over again, as above?</p>



<p>Will I have to take some quizzes that drill me on obscure syntax or make me solve toy problems that have no bearing on my engineering ability before I even get to have the aforementioned inane conversation with a recruiter?</p>



<p><strong>If I’m actually good at my job, why can’t I just set up some conversations with companies I think are cool and see if it’s a fit? Why do I have to subject myself and others to an endless parade of vapid conversations and the inevitable busywork that precedes them?</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the truth. Even if I look good on paper and am well-connected, hiring still sucks because of all the noise, uncertainty, and time wasted … but at least I have options. They might not be exactly the right options for me, but at least they exist. On the other hand, if I’m an engineer without a pedigree or a network, my choices are extremely limited, no matter how good I am. Recruiters aren’t reaching out to me, I’m not well-networked enough to have friends refer me, and I <em>definitely </em>don’t hear back when I apply.</p>



<hr>



<p>Let’s take a look at the other side of the table. Let’s say I’m an eng manager who needs to hire more competent generalists for my team. Having worked as both an eng manager and a recruiter, I can tell you that what happens next isn’t particularly inspiring.</p>



<p>As an eng manager, I sit down with a recruiter and try to explain what I’m looking for. Nine times out of ten, I want a <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/06/05/smart-and-gets-things-done/">smart person who can get shit done</a>. But, after a farcical game of telephone, somehow those criteria get warped into years of experience with a specific technology or requirements about where the candidate went to school. I also end up with an uninspired, sterile job description that fails to capture the imagination of any candidates who might unwittingly stumble upon it.</p>



<p><strong>My recruiter then goes to any number of sourcing tools of which LinkedIn Recruiter is the ubiquitous, lackluster market leader. They type in keywords I didn’t ask for and filter on credentials I don’t care about to come up with the same homogenous list of candidates every other recruiter at every other tech company is chasing.</strong></p>



<p>They then contact these candidates en masse with generic copy about my team and the hard problems we’re solving. They celebrate single-digit response rates and spend the minimal time left over to give a cursory glance at candidates applying directly.</p>



<h2>Why is hiring broken?</h2>



<p>So therein lies the ineffectual dance. This is the process we’ve come to accept. As far as I can tease out, the axioms that underlie today’s recruiting best practices go something like this (some of these were told to me verbatim when I was starting out as a recruiter, even):</p>



<ol><li><strong>Thou shalt not engage with active candidates. After all, in this market, strong candidates aren’t looking. Good recruiters build relationships so that when a good candidate does decide to enter the market, the recruiter is there, behind the next doorway, ready to spring!</strong></li><li><strong>Engineering time is expensive, so it’s critical to do as much top-of-funnel filtering as possible to make sure that it’s spent on the right candidates.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Are these axioms wrong? The sad truth is … not really. I’ve written in a <a href="http://blog.alinelerner.com/the-unvarnished-unbundled-guide-to-hiring-tools/">previous post about how market forces rule everything around me</a>, and recruiting best practices are no exception. In an economy with a surplus of jobs and a shortage of talent, it follows that the best talent is going to be harder to find, engineering time will be expensive, and recruiters in their current incarnation are, dare I say it, a necessary evil. <sup><a href="#footnote_0_2455" id="identifier_0_2455" title="From what you’ve read up until this point, you might think that I hate recruiters and find them useless. Not so, dear reader! I hate bad recruiters. And, unfortunately, most of them are bad. What’s sad is that the good ones, instead of spending time on tasks for which they’re uniquely qualified and well-suited, are instead stuck at the top of the funnel sourcing engineers whose qualifications they don’t have the domain expertise to evaluate and selling them on roles they don’t have the domain expertise to describe. The best recruiters I’ve worked with are singularly amazing at shepherding candidates through the process, tirelessly stewarding a company’s employer brand, advising hiring managers on the best ways to close, keeping an analytical eye on the funnel to identify issues before they even arise, and much more.">1</a></sup></p>



<p>The data supports our current world view. According to Lever (one of the two application tracking systems widely used by startups, Greenhouse is the other), here’s a breakdown of how many candidates from each source it takes to make a hire. Note that here, larger numbers are bad — for many companies, internal referrals are the best source and inbound applications are the worst.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="375" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-750x375.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-450x225.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2-768x384.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/graphLever2.png 1008w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.lever.co/recruiting-resources/articles/recruitment-process/</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking at this data, you can see why recruiters simply ignore online applications. The same dynamics also apply to platforms such as AngelList — like any jobs board, it’s noisy and probably full of candidates who don’t have much leverage (e.g., juniors/bootcamp grads and people requiring visa sponsorship).</p>



<p>As for the value of eng time, guarding it carefully isn’t exactly wrong either. In fact, if you look at what a typical hiring process looks like today, you’ll see that most of the time spent is by engineers conducting interviews.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Hiring process stage</strong></th><th>Who does it?</th><th>How long does it take?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Resume review</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>10-30 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Recruiter screen</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>45 min</td></tr><tr><td>Technical phone screen</td><td>Engineer</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Eng portion</td><td>Engineer</td><td>6 hours</td></tr><tr><td>Onsite – Recruiter portion</td><td>Recruiter</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>Offer</td><td>Recruiter OR Eng mgr</td><td>1 hour</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Engineering salaries are high, so given that most of the time spent on a single candidate is with engineers, it’s <em>rational</em> to put some recruiter gates at the top of the funnel to protect eng time. The idea is that recruiters will effectively screen out most candidates and only pass on the most promising ones to the eng team.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, when you look at an actual typical <em>funnel</em>, you’ll see that despite attempts to gate the top with recruiters filtering resumes and making intro calls, it’s not really working. Below is what a typical funnel looks like.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="750" height="89" src="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-750x89.png" alt="" srcset="http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-750x89.png 750w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-450x53.png 450w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42-768x91.png 768w, http://blog.alinelerner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2019-03-23-17.34.42.png 1092w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>



<p>If you <a href="https://blog.interviewing.io/you-probably-dont-factor-in-engineering-time-when-calculating-cost-per-hire-heres-why-you-really-should/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do the math</a> and look at how many hours are spent — not per candidate but per hire (more useful because hires are ultimately what we want) — you’ll see that despite attempts to save eng time, recruiters spend roughly 15 hours a hire <sup><a href="#footnote_1_2455" id="identifier_1_2455" title="If we add in time to review resumes, it’s an extra five hours (at most).">2</a></sup> and engineers spend about 40. In a process where you don’t make an offer 50% of the time and only convert those offers to hires 50% of …</p></div></div>

Luckily for me, AWS publishes this all here <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json</a>. When you go through this list, you’ll quickly see that AWS has a massive asset of IPv4 allocations. Just counting quickly I noticed a lot of big prefixes.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever wondered what all of the AWS network ranges are? You can find them all here:<a href="https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la">https://t.co/NBaBF6w0la</a><br>That's *a lot* of big prefixes!<br>4x /11, 14x /12, 30x /13, 78x /14, 184x /15, 278x /16</p>— Andree Toonk, Adelante! (@atoonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/atoonk/status/1316098702260359168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>However, the IPv4 ranges on that list are just the ranges that are in use and allocated today by AWS. Time to dig a bit deeper.</p><h3 id="ipv4-address-acquisitions-by-aws">IPv4 address acquisitions by AWS</h3><p>Over the years, AWS has acquired a lot of IPv4 address space. Most of this happens without gaining too much attention, but there were a few notable acquisitions that I’ll quickly summarize below.</p><h4 id="2017-mit-selling-8-million-ipv4-addresses-to-aws">2017: MIT selling 8 million IPv4 addresses to AWS</h4><p>In 2017 <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/05/mit-goes-on-ipv4-selling-spree/" rel="noopener">MIT sold half of its 18.0.0.0/8</a> allocation to AWS. This 18.128.0.0/9 range holds about 8 million IPv4 addresses.</p><h4 id="2018-ge-sells-3-0-0-0-8-to-aws">2018: GE sells 3.0.0.0/8 to AWS</h4><p>In 2018 the IPv4 prefix 3.0.0.0/8 was transferred from GE to AWS. With this, AWS became the proud owner of its first /8! That’s sixteen million new IPv4 addresses to feed us hungry AWS customers. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18407173</a></p><h4 id="2019-aws-buys-amprnet-44-192-0-0-10">2019: AWS buys AMPRnet 44.192.0.0/10</h4><p>In 2019 AWS bought a /10 from AMPR.org, the Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC). The IPv4 range 44.0.0.0/8 was an allocation made to the Amateur Radio organization in 1981 and known as the AMPRNet. This sell caused a fair bit of discussion, check out the <a href="https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2019-July/thread.html#102103" rel="noopener">nanog discussion here.</a></p><p>Just this month, it <a href="http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2020/october/sale-of-amateur-radio-amprnet-tcp-ip-addresses.htm" rel="noopener">became public knowledge</a> AWS paid $108 million for this /10. That’s $25.74 per IP address.</p><p>These are just a few examples. Obviously, AWS has way more IP addresses than the three examples I listed here. The IPv4 transfer market is very active. Check out this website to get a sense of all transfers: <a href="https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log#NRPM-8.3IPv4" rel="noopener">https://account.arin.net/public/transfer-log</a></p><h3 id="all-aws-ipv4-addresses">All AWS IPv4 addresses</h3><p>Armed with the information above it was clear that not all of the AWS owned ranges were in the <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json">JSON</a> that AWS published. For example, parts of the 3.0.0.0/8 range are missing. Likely because some of it is reserved for future use.</p><p>Combining all those IPv4 prefixes, removing duplicates and overlaps by aggregating them results in the following list of unique IPv4 address owned by AWS: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#all-prefixes</a></p><p>The total number of IPv4 addresses in that list is just over 100 Million (100,750,168). That’s <strong>the equivalent of just over six /8’s,</strong> not bad!</p><p>If we break this down by allocation size, we see the following:</p><pre><code>1x /8     =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
1x /9     =&gt; 8,388,608 IPv4 addresses
4x /10    =&gt; 16,777,216 IPv4 addresses
5x /11    =&gt; 10,485,760 IPv4 addresses
11x /12   =&gt; 11,534,336 IPv4 addresses
13x /13   =&gt; 6,815,744 IPv4 addresses
34x /14   =&gt; 8,912,896 IPv4 addresses
53x /15   =&gt; 6,946,816 IPv4 addresses
182x /16  =&gt; 11,927,552 IPv4 addresses
&lt;and more&gt;</code></pre><p>A complete breakdown can be found here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gist.github.com/atoonk/b749305012ae5b86bacba9b01160df9f#breakdown-by-ipv4-prefix-size</a></p><h3 id="putting-a-valuation-on-aws-ipv4-assets">Putting a valuation on AWS’ IPv4 assets</h3><blockquote>Alright.. this is just for fun…</blockquote><p>Since AWS is (one of) the largest buyers of IPv4 addresses, they have spent a significant amount on stacking up their IPv4 resources. It’s impossible, as an outsider, to know how much AWS paid for each deal. However, we can for fun, try to put a dollar number on AWS’ current IPv4 assets.</p><p>The average price for IPv4 addresses has gone up over the years. From ~$10 per IP a few years back to ~$25 per IP <a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/" rel="noopener">nowadays</a>. <br>Note that these are market prices, so if AWS would suddenly decide to sell its IPv4 addresses and overwhelm the market with supply, prices would drop. But that won’t happen since we’re all still addicted to IPv4 ;)</p><p>Anyway, let’s stick with $25 and do the math just for fun.</p><pre><code>100,750,168 ipv4 addresses x $25 per IP = $2,518,754,200</code></pre><p>Just<strong> over $2.5 billion worth of IPv4 addresses,</strong> not bad! </p><h3 id="peeking-into-the-future">Peeking into the future</h3><p>It’s clear AWS is working hard behind the scenes to make sure we can all continue to build more on AWS. One final question we could look at is: <em>how much buffer does AWS have?</em> ie. how healthy is their IPv4 reserve?</p><p>According to their <a href="https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json" rel="noopener">published data</a>, they have allocated roughly 53 Million IPv4 addresses to existing AWS services. We found that all their IPv4 addresses combined equates to approximately 100 Million IPv4 addresses. That means they still have ~47 Million IPv4 addresses, or 47% available for future allocations. That’s pretty healthy! And on top of that, I’m sure they’ll continue to source more IPv4 addresses. The IPv4 market is still hot!</p></div>

</div>
<p><em>"There are 10 types of people: those who understand binary, and those who don't."</em></p>
<p>I recently read <a href="https://gist.github.com/gretingz/bc194c20a2de2c7bcc0f457282ba2662">this writeup</a> about using Rust's type system to prove that 1 + 1 = 2, and was inspired to make a version of it with a more efficient representation.
To recap (but really, read that post first if you haven't already), they used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano</a> representation of the natural numbers, which is based on the <em>successor</em> function <code>$S$</code>:</p>
<pre><code>\begin{aligned}
1 &amp; = S(0) \\
2 &amp; = S(1) = S(S(0)) \\
3 &amp; = S(2) = S(S(S(0))) \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}
</code></pre>
<p>In this system, every natural number is defined as some finite recursive applications of <code>$S$</code>, terminating at zero.
This is simple, but also tremendously inefficient.
We need a representation of length <code>$O(n)$</code> just to represent <code>$n$</code>.</p>
<p>Positional systems, like the familiar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a> (base 10) system, have representations of length just <code>$O(\log n)$</code>.
This is <em>exponentially</em> better; we can write down numbers like 1,000,000 without pages and pages of <code>$S(S(S(\ldots$</code>
This extra efficiency should let us do some bigger calculations with our numbers-as-types.</p>
<h2><a href="#single-bit-operations" id="single-bit-operations">Single-bit operations</a></h2>
<p>We're going to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> rather than decimal, to simplify the case work.
If we were going to represent binary numbers at runtime, we could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug)]
enum Bit {
    Zero,
    One,
}

use Bit::*;
</code></pre>
<p>The simplest piece of arithmetic we can implement is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Half_adder">half adder</a>:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug)]
</span><span>enum Bit {
</span><span>    Zero,
</span><span>    One,
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>use Bit::*;
</span><span>
</span>fn half_adder(a: Bit, b: Bit) -&gt; (Bit, Bit) {
    match (a, b) {
        (Zero, Zero) =&gt; (Zero, Zero),
        (Zero, One)  =&gt; (One,  Zero),
        (One,  Zero) =&gt; (One,  Zero),
        (One,  One)  =&gt; (Zero, One),
    }
}

let (s, c) = half_adder(One, One);
println!("One plus One is {:?}, carry the {:?}", s, c);
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But we want to do all this at compile-time, not runtime, so we have to lift a few things up to the type level.
Values become types:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct Zero;
#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct One;
</code></pre>
<p>The type-level version of functions like <code>half_adder</code> are traits with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/generics/assoc_items/types.html">associated types</a>:</p>
<pre><code>trait HalfAdder {
    type Sum;
    type Carry;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The "parameters" to the function are passed through the <code>Self</code> type.
The "return values" are the associated types <code>Sum</code> and <code>Carry</code>.
We can "evaluate" the function by writing something like <code>&lt;(One, One) as HalfAdder&gt;::Sum</code>.
Note that <code>(One, One)</code> is a type here, not a value.</p>
<p>Finally, the type-level version of a <code>match</code> block is just different <code>impl</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>impl HalfAdder for (Zero, Zero) {
    type Sum = Zero;
    type Carry = Zero;
}

impl HalfAdder for (Zero, One) {
    type Sum = One;
    type Carry = Zero;
}

impl HalfAdder for (One, Zero) {
    type Sum = One;
    type Carry = Zero;
}

impl HalfAdder for (One, One) {
    type Sum = Zero;
    type Carry = One;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's test this implementation with some type annotations:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span><span>struct Zero;
</span><span>struct One;
</span><span>
</span><span>trait HalfAdder {
</span><span>    type Sum;
</span><span>    type Carry;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>impl HalfAdder for (Zero, Zero) {
</span><span>    type Sum = Zero;
</span><span>    type Carry = Zero;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>impl HalfAdder for (Zero, One) {
</span><span>    type Sum = One;
</span><span>    type Carry = Zero;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>impl HalfAdder for (One, Zero) {
</span><span>    type Sum = One;
</span><span>    type Carry = Zero;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>impl HalfAdder for (One, One) {
</span><span>    type Sum = Zero;
</span><span>    type Carry = One;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span>// Convenient shorthand
type HalfSum&lt;A, B&gt; = &lt;(A, B) as HalfAdder&gt;::Sum;
type HalfCarry&lt;A, B&gt; = &lt;(A, B) as HalfAdder&gt;::Carry;

// The type before the `=` has to match the value
let _: HalfSum&lt;One, One&gt; = Zero;
let _: HalfCarry&lt;One, One&gt; = One;

println!("It works!");
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We can implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Full_adder">full adder</a> on top of the half adder:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]

</span><span>        (Zero, One)  =&gt; (One,  Zero),
</span><span>        (One,  Zero) =&gt; (One,  Zero),
</span><span>        (One,  One)  =&gt; (Zero, One),
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span>fn full_adder(a: Bit, b: Bit, c: Bit) -&gt; (Bit, Bit) {
    let (d, e) = half_adder(a, b);
    let (f, g) = half_adder(c, d);
    let (h, _) = half_adder(e, g);
    (f, h)
}

let (s, c) = full_adder(One, One, One);
println!("One plus One plus One is {:?}, carry the {:?}", s, c);
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Or, at the type level:</p>
<pre><pre><code>

<h2><a href="#addition" id="addition">Addition</a></h2>
<p>To represent natural numbers at runtime as sequences of bits, we could do this:</p>
<pre><code>type Natural = Vec&lt;Bit&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>But there's not really a nice equivalent of <code>Vec</code> at the type level.
Instead, we can think a little more functionally and use a recursive linked list:</p>
<pre><pre><code>
<span>#![allow(unused)]
</span><span>fn main() {
</span><span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug)]
</span><span>enum Bit {
</span><span>    Zero,
</span><span>    One,
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span>use Bit::*;
</span><span>
</span>#[derive(Debug)]
enum Natural {
    Nil,
    Cons(Bit, Box&lt;Natural&gt;),
}

use Natural::*;

fn cons(bit: Bit, tail: Natural) -&gt; Natural {
    Cons(bit, Box::new(tail))
}

let zero  =                                 Nil;
let one   =                       cons(One, Nil);
let two   =            cons(Zero, cons(One, Nil));
let three =            cons(One,  cons(One, Nil));
let four  = cons(Zero, cons(Zero, cons(One, Nil)));

println!("{:?}", four);
<span>}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The bits are ordered from least to most significant.
This is backwards from our usual way of writing numbers, but it makes the implementation a bit easier.
Here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)#Ripple-carry_adder">ripple-carry adder</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">Cons cells</a> are just pairs, so we can use tuple types to represent type-level lists.
This is the only part that's easier to read at the type level :)</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug, Default)]
struct Nil;

type NatZero =                     Nil;
type NatOne  =               (One, Nil);
type Two     =        (Zero, (One, Nil));
type Three   =        (One,  (One, Nil));
type Four    = (Zero, (Zero, (One, Nil)));
</code></pre>
<p>Like before, let's make a trait for our ripple adder function:</p>
<pre><code>/// Given natural numbers A, B, and a carry bit C, computes A + B + C.
trait RippleAdder {
    type Sum;
}

type RippleSum&lt;A, B, C&gt; = &lt;(A, B, C) as RippleAdder&gt;::Sum;

<p>Welcome to the fortieth issue of <a href="https://www.racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> News.</p>

<p>Racket is in an exciting place and there was no place better to see that than in the community that joined Gather last weekend for RacketCon 2020. Due to the global pandemic, we did not manage to get together in-person but we still spent some time together discussing all things Racket and socializing in Gather’s virtual environment. This issue is packed with information including links to videos for all the talks in RacketCon. I can’t wait to see what next year will bring us - hope you are excited as I am.</p>

<p>Grab an espresso and enjoy!</p>

<p>Want to contribute to Racket? Don’t know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.</p>

<p>This week I (happily) had my plans squashed by our last “Call to Racket” champion <code>xxyzz</code>. I created issue <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3446">#3446</a> for this issue’s “Call to Racket” but before I could press “Publish” on this issue, <code>xxyzz</code> created PR <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/3447">#3447</a> to fix it (way to go <code>xxyzz</code> - thanks for the fix). Therefore I will once again issue a call to fix <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/3161">issue 3161</a>. If you are interested in fixing this but need some guidance, feel free to comment on the issue page. Will you be our next Champion?</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>





<p>This week’s project in the spotlight is <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/plot/index.html">Plot</a> by Neil Toronto, currently maintained by Alex Harsányi.</p>

<p>From the website:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>The Plot library provides a flexible interface for producing nearly any kind of plot. It includes many common kinds of plots already, such as scatter plots, line plots, contour plots, histograms, and 3D surfaces and isosurfaces. Thanks to Racket’s excellent multiple-backend drawing library, Plot can render plots as interactive snips in DrRacket, as picts in slideshows, as PNG, PDF, PS and SVG files, or on any device context.</p></blockquote>





<p>This issue’s featured paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ogGwX9bJH9ZvccFjvTWpZFY757T1z5Gr/view?usp=sharing">Corpse Reviver: Sound and Efficient Gradual Typing via Contract Verification</a> by Cameron Moy, Phúc C. Nguyễn, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, and David van Horn.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Gradually-typed programming languages permit the incremental addition of static types to untyped programs. To remain sound, languages insert run-time checks at the boundaries between typed and untyped code. Unfortunately, performance studies have shown that the overhead of these checks can be disastrously high, calling into question the viability of sound gradual typing. In this paper, we show that by building on existing work on soft contract verification, we can reduce or eliminate this overhead. Our key insight is that while untyped code cannot be trusted by a gradual type system, there is no need to consider only the worst case when optimizing a gradually-typed program. Instead, we statically analyze the untyped portions of a gradually-typed program to prove that almost all of the dynamic checks implied by gradual type boundaries cannot fail, and can be eliminated at compile time. Our analysis is modular, and can be applied to any portion of a program. We evaluate this approach on a dozen existing gradually-typed programs previously shown to have prohibitive performance overhead — with a median overhead of 3.5x and up to 73.6x in the worst case — and eliminate all overhead in most cases, suffering only 1.6x overhead in the worst case.</p></blockquote>

				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Sometimes I notice that some developers are quite good at giving good names to variables but they are not paying much attention to actual variable values. Usually, it happens in test cases. I absolutely got the reason why it happens: tests are written after the implementation, people are in rush and destructed by annoying static analysis issues, you name it.</p>
<p>Code is written for people and only then for machines. So when it comes to reading through the tests cases written in such manner we become confused. Take a look at this example (in pseudo-code):</p>
<pre><code>def processPaymentIfRegionIsValid
    String region = "region1";
    when(regionValidator).isValid("region1").itReturns(true);
    
    paymentProcessor.withRegionValidator(regionValidator).run(user);
    
    verify(paymentProcessor.processed).isTrue;
end
</code></pre>
<p>From implementation point of view test is valid and it does its job, but <code>region1</code> it's a real problem here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Poor readability. Ultimately <code>region1</code> value holds the same (none) meaning as <code>var1</code> for variable names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a fake value because it doesn't belong to the domain. It means that newcomers or people who are fresh to this domain will falsely assume that region1 is a possible value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It hides an example of real values. Usually, documentation is quiet in general and finding a list of possible regions could be a problem, which may require asking around people who have this knowledge. It will be better to use here instead of <code>region1</code> real value like <code>APAC</code> or even have separate test cases for every possible (supported) region value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To tackle all of mentioned issues is quite easy, just give it a good value:</p>
<pre><code>def processPaymentIfRegionIsValid
    String region = "APAC";
    when(regionValidator).isValid("APAC").itReturns(true);
    
    paymentProcessor.withRegionValidator(regionValidator).run(user);
    
    verify(paymentProcessor.processed).isTrue;
end
</code></pre>

Maybe you’re using Node.js or Python or any other dynamic language that uses JSON-like data natively or maybe you’re working with data that you’re pulling or serving from REST APIs. Either way, increasingly it seems like everything is ending up in JSON at some point.  Most of the time, this isn’t a problem, it’s just the way that we build software these days.  There’s just one problem, and that’s that Cassandra isn’t particularly good at JSON…</p>

<p>To double-click on that, the problem isn’t the JSON data format itself, although Cassandra doesn’t make JSON easy, it’s the way most devs use JSON when we’re building our apps.  Iterative development means that plans change.  The user registration form now needs a couple of more fields and the front-end dev went ahead and added them.  That API I’m calling returns some extra data.   Welcome to the loosely coupled world, it’s all fun and games until my app needs to send it to the database.</p>

<p>In the early days, Cassandra actually made this pretty simple to do, but as the project matured and added features like enterprise-friendly SQL-like query languages and better indexing, that meant that we needed the database to enforce a schema.  Over time, it became harder and harder to use Cassandra for things like JSON and other document-oriented use cases.</p>

<p>Enter Stargate - if there’s one thing you should know about the Stargate team it’s that our personal mission is to make Cassandra easy for every developer.  Figuring out how to give Javascript devs native JSON support without having to give up any of the reliability and scalability goodness of Cassandra was a challenge we couldn’t pass up.</p>

<p>This idea gave rise to the Stargate <strong>Documents API</strong>, which lets most Cassandra distros (Cassandra 3.11, Cassandra 4.0, and DataStax Enterprise 6.8), work with JSON through a REST API.</p>

<h2 id="api-features-and-design">API features and design</h2>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/tjake">Jake Luciani</a> and I started to create the bones of this API, we realized that Cassandra is nothing like a document store. Expressing data as rows is straightforward, but expressing trees of JSON data is really not. In addition, mapping that JSON data onto a table managed by Stargate and keeping both writes and reads reasonably fast adds an additional layer of complexity.</p>

<p>From here, we mapped out three main design components in order for this work:
Modeling Documents in Cassandra
Handling Reads and Writes
Figuring out Deletes</p>

<p>The rest of this blog walks through how we approached each design and resolved some hiccups along the way.
Modeling Documents in Cassandra with Document Shredding</p>

<p>The first thing that we had to decide  was the schema of the managed table that backs a document collection. Due to some great discussions with some Cassandra specialists, it was decided that when a user creates a document, a table will be created with a statement of the form:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>key</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>p0</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>…</span> <span>p</span><span>[</span><span>N</span><span>]</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span>
  <span>bool_value</span> <span>boolean</span><span>,</span>
  <span>txt_value</span> <span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>d</span>
  <span>bl_value</span> <span>double</span><span>,</span> <span>leaf</span> <span>text</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At this point is where we had to solve an unbounded data modeling problem. Because any JSON document that has a depth of [N] or less can be added to this table, each value in the JSON will get stored as a row in the table. So if I wanted to represent a document called “x” that has the JSON:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The document would be “shredded” into rows looking like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For data with an array, such as:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>"a"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>"b"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>"c"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>"d"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>}]}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>there would be two rows, like so:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>p0</th>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>dbl_value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>b</td>
      <td>null</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>c</td>
      <td>[0]</td>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Array elements are stored with square braces in the column.</p>

<h3 id="handling-reads-and-writes">Handling Reads and Writes</h3>

<p>The next problem that arose was that naïvely, updates to a document could require reading the document from the database, seeing what modification would have to be made, and then writing the updated data.  This “read-before-write” process is a notorious source of performance and consistency issues in most data stores.</p>

<p>Therefore, we resolved to avoid doing any read-before-write operations at all costs.</p>

<p>An interesting implementation detail that came up is that when you write some data to a document, the resulting write operation is just a simple batch with some inserts and deletes. In some cases, this can cause the document rows in the database to show two different states for the same JSON field.</p>

<p><em>And, upon reading the rows out, the Documents API reconciles conflicting information by accepting the data that has a later Cassandra write time (much like Cassandra itself!).</em></p>

<p>This allows us to write data really quickly while not compromising too much in reads either, as the reconciliation does not happen often and is also quite fast. It also gives us a very important core principle to our basic write and read operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every write to a single document is a single batch of statements, and</li>
  <li>Every read from a single document is a single SELECT statement.</li>
</ol>

<p>So writes and reads are squared away - but what about deletes?</p>

<h3 id="figuring-out-deletes">Figuring out Deletes</h3>

<p>Because of the distributed nature of the database, a deletion in Cassandra actually is very similar to an insert, but instead a “tombstone” is written at a particular write time to signify the death of a row.</p>

<p>Rest in peace… almost</p>

<p>Cassandra periodically (the frequency here depends on your compaction strategy and/or cluster load) does a compaction operation to remove tombstones and alleviate this pressure, so the only way to avoid overwhelming Cassandra is to make sure that the frequency of deletions is low enough.</p>

<p>This poses a problem for the Document API specifically because of arrays. Let’s walk through this one.</p>

<p>Imagine that you have an array at some key that is of length 100000. If you then issue a replace operation (via a PUT) and decide to replace that array with some other value, then all of those 100000 rows would be deleted, causing 100000 tombstones to be written.  This is an enormous number of tombstones to be written in one operation, and if you do that just a few more times, Cassandra will likely get super slow. So the structure of the data in each table needed one last major modification.</p>

<p>We said before that array paths are stored in the database with square brackets; for example the element at index 0 would be stored as [0]. That would mean a deletion of 100000 elements would look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>in</span> <span>(</span><span>'[0]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[1]'</span><span>,</span> <span>'[2]'</span><span>,</span> <span>…</span><span>,</span> <span>'[99999]'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Causing 100000 tombstones to be written. Instead of doing that, we decided to pad all array elements with leading zeros, so the element at index 0 would instead be represented as [000000], and the element at index 99999 would be [099999]. Doing this allowed us to change the deletion statement to:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>name</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>where</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>'[000000]'</span> <span>and</span> <span>p0</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>'[999999]'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Which causes only a single so-called “range” tombstone to be written, instead of 100000 cell tombstones (note that greater and less than works on strings in Cassandra and will compare lexically). It also relaxes the array length limit to one million elements, which is pretty neat! The time series below shows how the old vs. new implementation might behave, if you performed compactions every week:</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png"></p>

<p>So the new strategy is just safer for deletions; it would require an incredibly large amount of deletion with the new strategy to even come close to the theoretical tombstone limits!</p>

<h2 id="preliminary-look-at-api-performance">Preliminary Look at API performance</h2>

<p>⚠️ Before starting on this section, we want to mention that benchmarking is a great tool, but does not necessarily represent how a system will behave under real load, out in the wild. We also haven’t done comparisons on the same hardware with other document stores…yet. Alright, let’s get to it!</p>

<p>In order to test that the Document API is reasonably fast, we ran a benchmark test using a single Cassandra storage node and a single Stargate node (Stargate is the API that contains the Documents API). We then ran two different benchmarks, one that uses HTTP GET to repeatedly get random paths in a document, and another that performs HTTP POSTs repeatedly to create brand new documents.  Each of these actions got run 100000 times, and here are two graphs of the results.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, as there is no baseline to compare things against just yet, the benchmark was performed using only one requester at a time, with light concurrency (10 users at once), and with more concurrency (100 users at once). Note that it’s expected with only one backend node that higher concurrency would cause degradation in performance; you should have multiple nodes to service that degree of concurrent requests!</p>

<p>Here are the results for reads:</p>



<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1 user:</th>
      <th>10 users:</th>
      <th>100 users:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_1_User.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_1_User.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_10_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_10_Users.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_100_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_100_Users.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And for writes:</p>



<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1 user:</th>
      <th>10 users:</th>
      <th>100 users:</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_1_User.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_1_User.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_10_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_10_Users.png"></td>
      <td><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_100_Users.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_100_Users.png"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>From the above, we can see that the API performs pretty well at a reasonable level of concurrency for our setup.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s to the accidental security engineers. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.</p>

  <p>To every engineer who’s ever spent a day scratching their head, wondering how to comply with a new security policy.</p>

  <p>To all those lost sprints building annoying primitives that “<em>have</em> to exist somewhere already”.</p>

  <p>To all the stressful weeks of getting pulled off new features to help prepare for an audit.</p>

  <p>To every web app, Slack bot, CLI, and microservice that was hacked together to help roll out a new control, only to become a pain-in-the-ass to maintain.</p>

  <p>It was us. We’ve been the ones tasked with building this mess. Constantly trading off velocity and security. But no more. We’re going to solve this problem, together, once and for all.</p>

  <p>Enter: Sym.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="hello-sym">Hello, Sym</h2>

<p>Sym is the security workflow platform made for engineers, by engineers. We solve the intent-to-execution gap between policies and workflows by providing fast-moving engineering teams with the just-right primitives to roll out best-practice controls.</p>

<p>Our hand-crafted Terraform templates let you easily provision instances of common security controls, while our Python SDK unlocks ridiculously simple customization to meet your team’s needs and integrate with existing tools. We’ve got our sights set on fixing the “Build vs Buy” problem with security workflows… the problem being that both options currently suck.</p>

<p>I’m overjoyed and humbled to share that we’re not embarking on this quest alone. We’re off to the races with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/sym-raises-9m-series-a-for-its-security-workflow-platform/">$9M Series A led by Sunil Dhaliwal at Amplify Partners</a>, following hot on the heels of a $3M Seed led by Robin Vasan at Mango Capital and Andy McLoughlin at Uncork Capital.</p>

<p>They say “never meet your heroes”, but with participation from security &amp; technology executives at GitHub, Datadog, Atlassian, Google, Bugsnag, and Segment, alongside early design partners like LaunchDarkly, we’re sure glad we met ours!</p>

<p>We’re excited to unveil our vision to the world, and announce that we’ve partnered with some of the best investors, engineers, and leaders in the industry to tackle this mountainous problem space. Every single person behind Sym has experienced our struggle first-hand (phew, we’re not crazy!), and won’t rest until we solve it. Let’s do this!</p>

<h2 id="howd-we-get-here">How’d we get here?</h2>

<p>Story time! I met Adam and Jon when I was a freshman at MIT. I distinctly remember walking into the Startup Career Fair wondering how I could circumvent the “no freshmen” rule most companies seemed to have when hiring interns. A friendly senior had let me know to watch out for the scores that recruiters would scrawl on resumes before haphazardly throwing them on the pile. A week prior, I watched a Facebook recruiter scratch a “1” onto mine, circling the sad number repeatedly before smiling and telling me to have a nice day. My world fell apart. This week was going to be different.</p>

<p>After having a great chat with this guy named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Tenev">Vlad</a> (Robinhood wasn’t a Big Deal yet), I ran into Adam. He was the VP of Engineering at a Boston-based company called Localytics, and seemed as relieved as I was to be having a conversation. I hesitantly bought into his pitch, and scheduled a time to come onsite. Little did I know, that thoughtless commitment would totally change the trajectory of my life, and one day be responsible for the founding of Sym!</p>

<p>The first meeting was uneventful, or so I thought. I showed up 30 minutes late to a rather exasperated Adam lecturing me on the demerits of interview tardiness. Throughout the years, I’ve grown very accustomed to that frustrated expression 😅. Though I’m still notoriously late for most things in life, I’ve never again failed to be punctual for a job interview!</p>

<p>Against his better judgement, Adam brought me on as an early intern at Localytics. It was my first job, and he was my first boss. I learned the ropes (read: how to ignore everyone’s advice while minimally pissing them off), and got to collaborate on some <a href="https://eng.localytics.com/your-code-coverage-is-bad-and-you-should-feel-bad/">really fun projects</a>. Jon (our third cofounder) spent a lot of time reprimanding me.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the summer <del>fighting</del> working together, and ended with a particularly controversial project where, against the better judgement of basically everyone, I pumped out a heap of flaky Javascript code for saving reports, and then peaced out from the company ✌️.</p>

<p>I’m extremely grateful that over the span of a decade, I stayed in touch with these two. Our relationship evolved, from manager-intern, to mentor-mentee, to peers, to cofounders. When I stepped away from my last company to start Sym, those two were my first call. And boy, am I glad they were.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e009c90866e63034acc943efabdfa4a6457078d7/c6517/assets/hello-sym/map.png" alt="Map"></p>

<h2 id="evolution-of-sym">Evolution of Sym</h2>

<p>When Jon, Adam, and I sat down to build Sym, we wanted to solve a very simple problem: every engineering org we know in a heavily-regulated space was building the same damn tooling. Coming from healthcare and enterprise SaaS, we’d seen permutations of the same few workflows time and time again throughout our careers. A way to grant engineers temporary access to infrastructure? Check. A way to approve one-off queries? Check. Something to make quarterly risk assessments suck less? Check. Chat-Ops for approving outgoing deploys? Check.</p>

<p>The crazy thing was, these seemed to be ubiquitous across companies, compliance standards, even industries. Chatting with fellow founders about stuff I’d built to help keep my team productive would always result in one of two reactions: “<em>oh yea, we built the same thing! let’s trade notes…“</em>, or <em>“oh shit, we should have built this years ago”</em>. So we came up with a crazy idea: what if we just build all this stuff once, and put it out in the world for everyone to use. We were going to start with HIPAA-induced workflows. Sym: HIPAA in a box, for engineers. Of course, things rarely work out that simply.</p>

<p>We rapidly discovered something while talking to potential users: our hypothesis that everyone is building tools for the same workflows was a bit off. It wasn’t the case that everyone’s workflows were identical, but instead that they had the same <em>shared core</em>. It turns out, what most teams do is they start by building the same <strong>primitives</strong>, and then they layer on <strong>customizations</strong> that reflect existing processes and tools. So, we adjusted our approach to match this revelation.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dc4f6494be10e2dfb90dc745bd96e83fffad695e/7aa7d/assets/hello-sym/graph.gif" alt="Graph"></p>

<p>Today, Sym is a set of workflow templates (<strong>primitives</strong>) for engineering teams working on improving security posture, and a suite of integrations (<strong>customizations</strong>) that connect those templates to existing systems and policies. Our mission is to enable any team to effortlessly build unobtrusive security and governance workflows, so we make sure to meet developers where they are: our primitives are exposed as Infrastructure-as-Code, and our SDK captures last-mile variance in workflows. The tools we use to distribute Sym Workflows are Terraform and Python, but your organization doesn’t have to be familiar with either to use us.</p>

<p>With Sym, you can roll out many common security and governance workflows with ~30 lines of declarative config and a couple function body definitions. Our goal is for you to blow your InfoSec team away; bring speed, sophistication, and thoroughness to your controls, without losing a whole month each time. Beautiful dashboards with just-right reports will materialize, without a single tedious line of logging code.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b56882478ed2e08f51d3f70075e993d385a2eef/193db/assets/hello-sym/code.png" alt="Code"></p>

<p>We’re currently live (in production!) at a handful of public and private companies in the Healthcare and B2B SaaS spaces. Our initial workflows focus on governance and just-in-time access of cloud and app-level resources.</p>

<p>Our latest customer is locking down SSH access by rolling out <a href="https://compliance.dev/2020/03/23/aws-session-manager-ssh-tunnels-with-less-user-management/">AWS Session Manager tunnels</a> as the preferred way to connect to instances, with the IAM Role required to use SSM protected by Sym. This is one of many examples where we’re able to help infra teams adopt cutting-edge cloud offerings while increasing security posture. If this sounds like something that you’d like for your team, please <a href="https://symops.com/">reach out</a>!</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-x">But what about X?</h2>

<p>We’re in a crowded space! Luckily, we see the world with a unique lens. Sym brings an emphasis on developer experience, opinionated workflows that codify best practices, and an aspiration to be the bridge between Security and Compliance. The jury’s still out on whether we’re totally brilliant or totally out to lunch.</p>

<p>Our vision at Sym is to become the de-facto standard for implementing and showcasing security posture. Importantly, we’re not setting out to be a middleman levying a tax on the system. We saw enough of those in our healthcare days. Instead, we’re striving to improve the status quo for every stakeholder in the security equation; our place as the obvious-choice bridge between security and compliance will be an emergent property of the system we’re fighting to improve.</p>

<p>We’ve got a long way to go to make that vision a reality. In the interim, we’re tackling several problems plaguing our friends and colleagues.</p>

<h3 id="security-intent-to-implementation-gap">Security intent-to-implementation gap</h3>

<p>A security intent-to-implementation gap is endemic in our industry today. Experts are laying out guidelines, policies, and best-practices, only to be foiled by the gargantuan effort required to implement workflows that reflect these intents. And to be honest, we can’t really blame engineering teams for this. As an industry, we’ve learned not to roll our own crypto, because it’s so easy to shoot yourself in the foot, but can you imagine how many ways there are to screw up a Slack bot that issues temporary database credentials? Or how easy it is to forget to put MFA around an admin God-mode dashboard? Twitter hack, anyone?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2fa7f55e98cd8c615f0db83c6fd96236b49266a2/67dc7/assets/hello-sym/headlines.png" alt="Headlines"></p>

<p>Sensitive access workflows are the perfect example of a control that should be implemented once, and safely customized many times. This is where Sym is starting today.</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        <p>Football (or soccer to my American readers) is full of clichés: “It’s a game of two halves”, “taking it one game at a time” and “Liverpool have failed to win the Premier League”. You’re less likely to hear “Treating the number of goals scored by each team as independent Poisson processes, statistical modelling suggests that the home team have a 60% chance of winning today”. But this is actually a bit of cliché too (it has been discussed <a href="https://www.pinnacle.com/en/betting-articles/soccer/how-to-calculate-poisson-distribution">here</a>, <a href="https://help.smarkets.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115001457989-How-to-calculate-Poisson-distribution-for-football-betting">here</a>, <a href="http://pena.lt/y/2014/11/02/predicting-football-using-r/">here</a>, <a href="http://opisthokonta.net/?p=296">here</a> and <a href="https://dashee87.github.io/data%20science/football/r/predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling/">particularly well here</a>). As we’ll discover, a simple Poisson model is, well, overly simplistic. But it’s a good starting point and a nice intuitive way to learn about statistical modelling. So, if you came here looking to make money, <a href="http://www.make5000poundspermonth.co.uk/">I hear this guy makes £5000 per month without leaving the house</a>.</p>

<h2 id="poisson-distribution">Poisson Distribution</h2>

<p>The model is founded on the number of goals scored/conceded by each team. Teams that have been higher scorers in the past have a greater likelihood of scoring goals in the future. We’ll import all match results from the recently concluded Premier League (2016/17) season. There’s various sources for this data out there (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer">kaggle</a>, <a href="http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php">football-data.co.uk</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata">github</a>, <a href="http://api.football-data.org/index">API</a>). I built an <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/footballR">R wrapper for that API</a>, but I’ll go the csv route this time around.</p>

<p>We imported a csv as a pandas dataframe, which contains various information for each of the 380 EPL games in the 2016-17 English Premier League season. We restricted the dataframe to the columns in which we’re interested (specifically, team names and numer of goals scored by each team). I’ll omit most of the code that produces the graphs in this post. But don’t worry, you can find that code on <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/blogScripts/blob/master/Jupyter/2017-06-04-predicting-football-results-with-statistical-modelling.ipynb">my github page</a>. Our task is to model the final round of fixtures in the season, so we must remove the last 10 rows (each gameweek consists of 10 matches).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>epl_1617</span> <span>=</span> <span>epl_1617</span><span>[:</span><span>-</span><span>10</span><span>]</span>

<div><div><pre><code>HomeGoals    1.591892

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll notice that, on average, the home team scores more goals than the away team. This is the so called ‘home (field) advantage’ (discussed <a href="https://jogall.github.io/2017-05-12-home-away-pref/">here</a>) and <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1803416-is-home-field-advantage-as-important-in-baseball-as-other-major-sports">isn’t specific to soccer</a>. This is a convenient time to introduce the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution</a>. It’s a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of the number of events within a specific time period (e.g 90 mins) with a known average rate of occurrence. A key assumption is that the number of events is independent of time. In our context, this means that goals don’t become more/less likely by the number of goals already scored in the match. Instead, the number of goals is expressed purely as function an average rate of goals. If that was unclear, maybe this mathematical formulation will make clearer:</p>



<p> represents the average rate (e.g. average number of goals, average number of letters you receive, etc.). So, we can treat the number of goals scored by the home and away team as two independent Poisson distributions. The plot below shows the proportion of goals scored compared to the number of goals estimated by the corresponding Poisson distributions.</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/home_away_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We can use this statistical model to estimate the probability of specfic events.</p>



<p>The probability of a draw is simply the sum of the events where the two teams score the same amount of goals.</p>



<p>Note that we consider the number of goals scored by each team to be independent events (i.e. P(A n B) = P(A) P(B)). The difference of two Poisson distribution is actually called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellam_distribution">Skellam distribution</a>. So we can calculate the probability of a draw by inputting the mean goal values into this distribution.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of draw between home and away team</span>

</code></pre></div></div>



<div><div><pre><code><span># probability of home team winning by one goal</span>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/skellam_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, hopefully you can see how we can adapt this approach to model specific matches. We just need to know the average number of goals scored by each team and feed this data into a Poisson model. Let’s have a look at the distribution of goals scored by Chelsea and Sunderland (teams who finished 1st and last, respectively).</p>

<p><img src="https://dashee87.github.io/images/chelsea_sunderland_goals_python.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="building-a-model">Building A Model</h2>

<p>You should now be convinced that the number of goals scored by each team can be approximated by a Poisson distribution. Due to a relatively sample size (each team plays at most 19 home/away games), the accuracy of this approximation can vary significantly (especially earlier in the season when teams have played fewer games). Similar to before, we could now calculate the probability of various events in this Chelsea Sunderland match. But rather than treat each match separately, we’ll build a more general Poisson regression model (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression">what is that?</a>).</p>

A positive value implies more goals (), while values closer to zero represent more neutral effects (). Towards the bottom of the table you might notice that <code>home</code> has a <code>coef</code> of 0.2969. This captures the fact that home teams generally score more goals than the away team (specifically, =1.35 times more likely). But not all teams are created equal.

						<p>Science has two stark problems: replication and innovation. Many scientific findings aren’t reproducible. That is to say, you can’t be sure that another study or experiment on the same question would get similar results. At the same time, the pace of scientific innovation could be slowing down.</p>
<p>Does attempting to solve one problem make the other worse? Many have argued that policies seeking to avoid reproducibility issues will create a constrictive atmosphere that inhibits innovation and discovery.</p>
<p>Indeed, top policymakers are worried about just this. Along with other prominent philanthropists and academics, I attended a White House meeting on scientific reproducibility early in 2020 (just before COVID-19 really hit). One of the key questions on a sheet of paper that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy circulated for discussion was whether a tradeoff existed: Would efforts to improve reproducibility risk harming the creativity and innovation of federally-funded research?</p>
<p>I do <i>not</i> think there’s a contradiction between reproducibility and innovation. Contrary to common belief, we can improve <i>both</i> at once – by incentivizing failed results, and by funding “Red Teams” that would aim to refute existing dogma or would be entirely outside it.</p>
<p>First, though, let’s take a step back, and briefly review the evidence that significant areas of science could be more reproducible and innovative.</p>
<h2><b>Is science reproducible?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>Many people have written about scientific irreproducibility over the past several decades. But the issue became more prominent in the mid-2000s with the publication of what soon became one of the most downloaded research papers of all time: The 2005 piece “<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False</a>,” by Stanford’s John Ioannidis. (Disclaimer: he is a long-time grantee of Arnold Ventures, where I work.)</p>
<p>To be sure, Ioannidis’s finding was mostly theoretical; it’s not as if he actually redid “most” published research (i.e., tens of millions of studies). Instead, he showed that given the way most studies are carried out, if journals have even a slight bias towards positive results (and they most definitely do), then most of the results that end up getting published would inevitably be statistical flukes or the results of p-hacking.</p>
<p>His theoretical case has been confirmed by many empirical studies in fields from drug development to psychology. Pharmaceutical companies such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/483531a">Amgen</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3439-c1">Bayer</a> have reported that they are unable to reproduce 80+% of experiments from prestigious journals. To quote Bayer’s scientists, “projects that were started in our company based on exciting published data have often resulted in disillusionment when key data could not be reproduced.”</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://osf.io/ezcuj/">Reproducibility Project in Psychology</a>, which we funded, and which was carried out by our grantee Center for Open Science. That project organized well over 200 psychology labs around the world to systematically redo 100 experiments published in top psychology journals. It found that only about 40% could be reliably replicated (another 40% were inconclusive, and around 20% were decisively <i>not</i> replicated). Since <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716">those results were published</a> in 2015, the study has already been cited <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10200793109432081889&amp;as_sdt=5,44&amp;sciodt=0,44&amp;hl=en">over 4,400 times</a> according to Google Scholar. Many of the most famous results in psychology have turned out to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/16/a-real-life-lord-of-the-flies-the-troubling-legacy-of-the-robbers-cave-experiment">unreliable</a> and possibly fraudulent (such as Zimbardo’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/13/17449118/stanford-prison-experiment-fraud-psychology-replication">Stanford prison experiment</a>), and the best recent treatment of this issue is Stuart Ritchie’s 2020 book “Science Fictions.”</p>
<p>To be sure, the problem seems much less acute in harder sciences – e.g., physics, chemistry, cosmology – that have an established tradition of skepticism, replication, or even <a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Paper-MacCounPerlmutter2017ch15.pdf">blinding researchers</a> to their own conclusions. The bulk of the reproducibility and publication bias problem seems to be in social science and biomedicine. In many of those fields and subfields – such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19160345/">clinical trials in medicine</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.1092.pdf">high-throughput bioinformatics</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000090">neuroimaging</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661314000540">cognitive science</a>, <a href="https://www.niss.org/publications/deming-data-and-observational-studies-process-out-control-and-needing-fixing">public health and epidemiological research</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joes.12032">economics</a>, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-fault-in-our-stars-%3A-Measuring-and-correcting-Esarey-Wu/48403d5dce1f2972c7a91af3bb2d41635221cb3f">political science</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23696308/">psychiatry</a>, <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1019294">education</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124108318973">sociology</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Memos/Examining-Reproducibility/">computer science</a>, and <a href="https://dennybritz.com/blog/ai-replication-incentives/">machine learning and AI</a> – the published literature features too many false positives as well as conclusions that may well be p-hacked. It’s enough to make folks at the White House, NIH, and NSF worried about the quality of federally-funded science.</p>
<h2><b>Is science innovative enough?<br>
</b></h2>
<p>At the same time, numerous observers have pointed to an entirely different problem: science has grown less innovative these days. (And even if it hasn’t, we could always benefit from faster innovation.)</p>
<p>In a recent piece, Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, and Michael Nielsen, a theoretical physicist, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/diminishing-returns-science/575665/">made the case</a> that the rate of scientific advancement is slowing down in recent years per dollar spent. Based on surveys of noted leaders in physics, chemistry, and medicine, they concluded, “Over the past century, we’ve vastly increased the time and money invested in science, but in scientists’ own judgement, we’re producing the most important breakthroughs at a near-constant rate. On a per-dollar or per-person basis, this suggests that science is becoming far less efficient.”</p>
<p>Collison and Nielsen are <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26752.pdf">far from alone</a>. Cowen and Southwood <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/sites/brown.edu.academics.political-theory-project/files/uploads/Innovation%20%26%20scientific%20progress.pdf">argue</a> that “there is good and also wide-ranging evidence that the rate of scientific progress has indeed slowed down.” The 2019 <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf">paper</a>, “Are Good Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” argues that in semiconductors, agriculture, and medical innovations, “research effort is rising substantially while research productivity is declining sharply.”	<sup data-close="x" data-content="[1]">[1]</sup>
	<span>They attempted to replicate this analysis for “the internal combustion engine, the speed of air travel, the efficiency of solar panels, the Nordhaus (1997) ‘price of light’ evidence, and the sequencing of the human genome.” But they couldn’t do so because there was no accurate measure of the amount of R&amp;D on those issues.</span>
	 That paper concludes by predicting that “just to sustain constant growth in GDP per person, the U.S. must double the amount of research effort searching for new ideas every 13 years to offset the increased difficulty of finding new ideas.”</p>
<p>Of course, some of these assessments might be too <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">pessimistic</a>. But it is depressingly common to hear the world’s most innovative scientists lament that they would never have succeeded in today’s academic or funding system because their work was too outside the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roger Kornberg (a Nobel-winning biochemist) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/27/AR2007052700794.html">told the Washington Post in 2007</a> that his 1970s research on DNA “would never have gotten the necessary funding” if he had come along in the 2000s: “In the present climate especially, the funding decisions are ultraconservative. If the work that you propose to do isn’t virtually certain of success, then it won’t be funded.”</li>
<li>As <a href="https://www.kqed.org/forum/201310090930/cuts-in-federal-funding-hurt-scientific-research">reported</a> in 2013, “UC Berkeley molecular biologist Randy Schekman won the Nobel Prize for Medicine with two other scientists this week. But he says the kind of basic science research that led to his prize might have never gotten funded if he were applying for grants today.”</li>
<li>David Deutsch, who pioneered quantum computing, <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/982233180081029128">says</a> that he would never have gotten his “first research grant on quantum computers . . . under today’s criteria.”</li>
<li>Peter Higgs, the Nobel Laureate for whom the Higgs Boson is named, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/dec/06/peter-higgs-boson-academic-system">believes</a> no university would employ him in today’s academic system because he would not be considered ‘productive’ enough. . . . ‘Today I wouldn’t get an academic job. It’s as simple as that. I don’t think I would be regarded as productive enough.’”</li>
</ul>
<p>When so many top scientists say that their own work would never have passed muster in the current system, we must take stock of the current system. As prominent scientists <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6441/613">have asked</a>, “How successful would Silicon Valley be if nearly 99% of all investments were awarded to scientists and engineers aged 36 years or older, along with a strong bias toward funding only safe, non-risky projects?” Moreover, a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/06/07/science-holds-key-unlocking-economic-success/">common complaint</a> is that “scientists are forced to specify years in advance what they intend to do, and spend their time continually applying for very short, small grants” – hardly a system that would encourage innovation.</p>
<p>In short, we have evidence that US science funding is often fairly tame and incremental, that some of the most innovative science of the past would <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/19/723326933/billion-dollar-gamble-how-a-singular-hero-helped-start-a-new-field-in-physics?fbclid=IwAR28fazRNhzzT5ijMINwzZkNqlP6fEfBlI4OLyY-eesrUyOfbZfF7-P4qUc">never have been funded</a> by today’s bureaucracy, and that scientific review panels are <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/492034a">dominated by insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, innovation in science is imperiled. If Einstein had to navigate such a system, we might <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/could-einstein-get-published-today-11600974323">never have heard of relativity</a>. And even if innovation weren’t slowing down <em>per se</em>, we could still do better.</p>
<h2><b>What next?</b></h2>
<p>There are lots of ideas about how to improve scientific reproducibility in how federal research is funded. After all, quality control and assurance are hardly new ideas.</p>
<p>For example, we could require that data and computer code be shared openly so that others can scrutinize and rerun it. In too many cases to list, this sort of reanalysis has led to revisions, retractions, and even the discovery of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/how-a-gay-marriage-study-went-wrong">outright fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we could require that experiments and other empirical studies be pre-registered, so that the analysis and results are less likely to be cherry-picked later. We already do this for clinical trials in medicine, and a <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132382">review</a> of federally-sponsored clinical trials found that the rate of positive results went down dramatically as soon as researchers were required to pre-register their studies. We could do the same for much else in science. We could even move towards more widespread use of the Registered Reports format, in which journals accept an article for publication before the final results are even available.</p>
<p>It’s less obvious how to reform government funding so as to improve scientific <i>innovation</i>. Let’s try a thought experiment:</p>
<p>Imagine that you were the President 100 years ago, instead of Woodrow Wilson. Imagine that a time-traveling genie from the future tells you that over the …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="bfa7"><a href="https://www.opendoor.com/" rel="noopener">Opendoor</a>, the nation’s largest <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48852-wth-is-an-ibuyer/" rel="noopener">iBuyer</a>, is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200915005665/en/" rel="noopener">going public</a>. It is doing so via a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp II (NYSE: IPOB), which is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by investor <a href="http://www.socialcapitalhedosophiaholdings.com/index.html" rel="noopener">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>. Opendoor published an <a href="https://www.opendoor.com/w/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Opendoor-Overview_vPDF_02.pdf" rel="noopener">investor presentation</a> as part of its merger announcement in September, and last week the company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801169/000110465920112009/tm2030455-1_s41.htm" rel="noopener">filed its S-4</a> (similar to an S-1, but used for companies engaged in a merger process). The transaction values Opendoor at $4.8B (pre-merger value) and the company will receive north of $1B in proceeds ($600M <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe-deal.asp" rel="noopener">PIPE</a> and $414M via merger with IPOB). While the SPAC merger process is quite interesting on its own (good posts on the topic <a href="https://medium.com/@andyravreby/attack-of-the-spac-baafd47f6ecc" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://luttig.substack.com/p/spac-attack-everything-a-founder" rel="noopener">here</a>), this post will focus in on the Opendoor business, its progress to date and its prospects for the future.</p><p id="ce64">Opendoor, founded in 2014, transforms the process of selling a home into a seamless digital experience, eliminating uncertainty for sellers. Sellers can go to Opendoor.com, receive an offer for their home, sign and close on the date of their choice — a dramatic improvement over the traditional selling process which can take 100+ days. In return, Opendoor receives a 6–12% discount on the market value of the home. This model is remarkably consistent with the vision described in Opendoor’s <a href="https://thomvest.box.com/v/opendoor_a" rel="noopener">Series A presentation</a> (worth a read). In addition to the spread captured when buying and selling homes, Opendoor earns revenue via ancillary services related to the real estate transaction, including title insurance, escrow services and home financing solutions.</p><p id="357e">In 2019, the company sold 18,799 homes across 21 markets, generating $4.7 billion in revenue (up more than 160% from the prior year). While the growth of the business has been impressive, Opendoor remains several years from profitability, having posted net losses of $339 million in 2019 and $117 million through the first half of 2020. Opendoor has ambitious plans to reach nearly 38,000 annual home sales and $10 billion in revenue by 2023. The company expects to become EBITDA-positive (on a non-GAAP basis) by the second half of 2023.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5208/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png" width="2604" height="920" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*ObnBGEhbx1BQTn-FZpNgjg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eefd">While the core vision of the company is quite elegant (“building the digital one-stop shop to move” according to Opendoor founder Eric Wu), the path to realizing that vision is incredibly complex. It requires thousands of employees across dozens of markets, holding billions in home value at any given time. So what is Opendoor’s path to becoming a large <em>and</em> profitable company? Below I’ve outlined <strong>five key</strong> <strong>“things you need to believe”</strong> as the company marches down that path, as well as some thoughts around the Opendoor’s valuation relative to other public real estate companies.</p><h2 id="a8ea">1. Opendoor’s economies of scale drive down per-unit expenses &amp; box-out competitors</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5220/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png" width="2610" height="1154" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TeL-vfUdrz4KJzeQg9BcWQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="ee83">Opendoor has built a massive home buying and selling operation that involves more than 1,000 employees across 21 markets. The company sold nearly 19,000 homes in 2019 (about 70 transactions per business day) and purchased thousands more. That scale is quite impressive given the fragmented, hyper-localized nature of real estate. This scale gives the company some important advantages:</p><ul><li id="0749">Opendoor has more borrowing capacity, a higher advance rate, and a lower cost of capital than many of its iBuyer peers; according to the company’s S-4, Opendoor has access to $2.8B in senior credit facilities with a total weighted average interest rate of 4%. It also has mezzanine facilities (loans that are subordinate to senior debt) in place to bring its effective advance rate to 100%. This allows the company to scale home purchase volume without tapping its own balance sheet.</li><li id="8800">Opendoor has developed a third-party network of more than 10,000 subcontractors, managed by a centralized operations team. This model has led to a 50% reduction in spend per home over the last 2 years. Additionally, the company has been able to negotiate bulk discounts on home materials (more than 40% lower than retail prices). According to <a href="https://www.mikedp.com/" rel="noopener">Mike DelPrete</a>, Opendoor’s average repair costs are about 2–2.5% of home value, compared to an estimated 4% at Offerpad and 5% at Zillow.</li></ul><p id="d50b"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="32f4">While economies of scale have definitely kicked in at Opendoor, there are also quite large fixed costs associated with operating the business that require <em>even greater</em> scale to overcome. For instance, in 2019 the company sold 18,799 homes and generated $301M in gross profit; however, its total operating expenses as a percentage of gross profit exceeded 180%.</p><p id="5020">Additionally, as the company continues to scale home purchase volume, incremental returns to scale may be diminished. For example, there are limitations to the bulk discounts suppliers can offer, limitations to cost of capital improvements, and some areas in which costs will always scale in proportion to volume (i.e. property taxes, utilities and insurance). And with time, its fellow iBuyers may achieve similar economies of scale. Given this dynamic, we expect the company to pursue incremental revenue streams as a means of improving its margin profile (more on this later).</p><h2 id="8003">2. Accumulating advantages makes the Opendoor business better &amp; more defensible over time</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5884/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png" width="2942" height="1140" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*GxiLv46smTkJlgphk1k20A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="eced">In addition to cost advantages that come with scale, Opendoor has developed a set of <em>accumulating data advantages</em> that are more proprietary and durable in nature. This informs the price it offers prospective home sellers, as well as the renovations made on purchased homes in order to maximize ROI. From the S-4:</p><blockquote><p id="b5aa">We have conducted over 150,000 home assessments during which we collect over 100 data points on each home and its surroundings. These proprietary data points have led us to make over one billion annotations and corrections to Multiple Listing Services (“MLS”) and tax assessor data, as well as build out new, non-traditional geospatial data assets, such as power line ​proximity and road noise level. The additional home level data we collect from local vendors provides structured feedback on each home and further strengthens our data moat.</p></blockquote><p id="9893">This data asset leads to better pricing models that can assign specific values to home features (i.e. granite vs. tile countertops) as well as identify the areas in which home renovations may drive the highest return. Better pricing accuracy creates an important flywheel for the business: pricing accuracy improvements allow Opendoor to lower the fee it charges, which increases purchase volume, which in turn further contributes to its data asset and pricing accuracy. There are also accumulating advantages around brand which may improve Opendoor’s customer acquisition costs over time. It’s no surprise that despite the proliferation of iBuyers over the last several years, Opendoor remains the largest with 64% market share (as of 2019).</p><p id="eefe"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="14b6">As the chart above indicates, iBuyers in total capture about 0.7% of U.S. home sale volume (pre-COVID). In Phoenix, Opendoor has bought and sold homes for the last six years, completing thousands of transactions and refining its pricing and operational models along the way. In Q1 2020, Opendoor reached 4.1% market share in Phoenix before pausing home buying due to COVID-19.</p><p id="c9c2">While that’s certainty impressive scale in a single market, it’s also indicative of the potential limits to capturing even more share — a large subset of sellers may simply prefer to market their homes as opposed to selling to an iBuyer at a discount. The next chapter of Opendoor’s growth story may not come solely from better pricing models, but instead by building new products and services that cater to multiple customer segments.</p><h2 id="4df8">3. Opendoor will be able to increase gross profit per transaction via ancillary products and services</h2><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5224/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png" width="2612" height="1064" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*kon3TuiR4W6a9B454wG1aA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="6e55">Critical to the Opendoor strategy is its ability to attach additional products and services to its transactions. The company expects its gross profit per home to increase by about $8,000 in 2023, driven primarily by these ancillary revenue streams. In its investor presentation, Opendoor highlighted several service areas, including:</p><ul><li id="3bbb">Integrated title insurance and escrow services (via its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/opendoor-acquires-title-and-escrow-company-os-national-300912033.html" rel="noopener">acquisition of OS National</a> in 2019). 80% of Opendoor home transactions that closed during 2019 included the in-house title &amp; escrow service (in the markets in which the service was available). This represents $1,750 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="f807">The company recently launched <a href="https://opendoorhomeloans.com/?abad=true" rel="noopener">Opendoor Home Loans</a>, a tech-enabled mortgage platform for customers looking to buy or refinance a home, which is licensed in eight states. This represents $5,000 in incremental margin per home.</li><li id="7404">Opendoor plans to add additional services over time, such as home insurance, home warranty, moving and storage, and home repair and maintenance. It believes these services represent up to $7,500 in incremental margin per home.</li></ul><p id="695c">The roll out of multiple services allows the company to create incentives for bundling. For example, Opendoor may be willing to lower its home purchase fee (currently 6%-12%) if a customer agrees to finance their next home with Opendoor Home Loans, or purchases an Opendoor home insurance policy. Bundling may then improve seller conversion rates — according to Opendoor’s investor presentation, sellers are about twice as likely to sell their home at a 6% fee vs. a 12% fee.</p><p id="47cf">This strategy has been executed successfully by home builders for many years. For example, <a href="https://lennar.com/" rel="noopener">Lennar</a> has an in-house financing arm called Eagle Point, which is used by buyers to finance about 70% of Lennar’s home sales.</p><p id="8c30"><strong><em>Potential Challenges</em></strong></p><p id="f697">As the Lennar expample indicates, this strategy around attaching multiple revenue streams to a real estate transaction is not new — it’s common amongst real estate brokerages, home builders, and technology-enabled real estate companies like Zillow. While Opendoor has demonstrated that it can generate a high attach rate with title &amp; escrow, the company did not provide data around its mortgage business or buy-side services. Title &amp; escrow are typically viewed as commodity offerings and consumers are more likely …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>A few days ago I read an interesting article titled <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/09/922262686/your-technology-is-tracking-you-take-these-steps-for-better-online-privacy"><strong>“Your Technology Is Tracking You. Take These Steps For Better Online Privacy”</strong></a> by Laurel Wamsley, who properly outlined the steps which every person on the internet should use, but to sum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong passwords or passphrases for your accounts</li>
<li>Don’t use the same passwords</li>
<li>Use password managers</li>
<li>Use 2-factor authentication</li>
<li>Keep your phone and pc updated</li>
<li>Use a website instead of installing an app whenever possible</li>
<li>Use encrypted messaging apps</li>
<li>Turn off ad personalization</li>
</ul>
<p>And many other important details, I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>While I completely agree with all the steps mentioned in the article, the problem I see is that these steps are taken only by tech-people, because fixing privacy is getting more and more complicated. So, explaining to them to our loved ones is always harder and harder. Instead, I suggested them out-of-the-box easy to use solutions.</p>
<p>These solutions are the apps I personally use daily on all of my devices, they make much easier to manage my privacy and security on the internet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Creating a successful new business is hard in any industry, but in insurance itâ€™s an especially daunting challenge. You need a world-class team, a differentiated product, and deeply supportive and patient carrier partners. Even with all of that, you need a healthy serving of luck.</p><p>At Newfront, weâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate to have all of those ingredients. And while weâ€™re still a long way off from achieving our ambitions, today is an important milestone. We've spent the last three years focusing on building a strong business, and today we're announcing that <strong>weâ€™ve raised more than $100MM to date, most recently at a $500MM valuation</strong>. Founders Fund and Meritech Capital are our lead investors. A full list of investors is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abe-4">here</a>.</p><p>While our journey is far from over, this has certainly been a time for us to pause and reflect on how far weâ€™ve come. My own story with insurance began early in my career. I was lucky to help build two highly successful companies (Invitation Homes and Opendoor) and in both cases I was tasked with handling our property and casualty insurance. While happy to take care of something as critical as mitigating existential risk, I was stunned by the archaic and confusing process. I filled out mountains of paperwork, waited for weeks, and then received back wildly different options that were nearly impossible to compare. There was no clear dataset to help me understand which carriers to approach, which coverages to seek, or how peer businesses were buying. The process repeated each year, and was even worse when dealing with claims.</p><p>As a businessperson, it shocked me that the safety net so crucial to a functioning economy, innovation, and entrepreneurship could be so broken. I dug in and found that I wasnâ€™t alone in feeling the pain. My co-founder Gordon, an MIT grad who built a startup acquired by LinkedIn, had dealt with the pain of buying insurance for his company. For too many business owners, dealing with insurance has become an unpleasant, almost unbearable process. For insurance industry professionals, doing their jobs has become tedious, with the productivity gains made in other industries passing them by, forcing longer hours for lower pay. For industry leaders, attracting high-quality talent to the industry has become an existential challenge. I became obsessed with the idea of modernizing the industry by empowering the people at its core with purpose-built technology.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Gordon and I launched Newfront in 2017, a year in which several startups were attracting huge investments with a goal of eliminating insurance brokers. We were convinced that their approach was dead wrong. We had already spent countless hours with CFOs, GCs, risk managers, and business owners and concluded that skilled insurance brokers are a <strong><em>foundational requirement</em></strong> for high-quality risk mitigation. The problem wasnâ€™t the broker, it was the brokerage. The typical brokerage forced brokers to behave like data collection and paperwork processing machines, preventing them from deepening their skills or providing expert advice. The brokerages had abandoned their brokers. We resolved to do something about that.</p><p>But first we needed to learn what had gone wrong. Why had brokerages fallen so far behind the innovation curve? Why was the average net promoter score for brokerages sitting at a dismal 17 (with 100 being the best)? Why werenâ€™t brokers given the tools that they needed? It didnâ€™t take long to learn that many of these changes resulted from the rise of private equity within the industry. Over a dozen years, private equity funds had purchased thousands of brokerages around the United States with an exclusive focus on generating short-term gains for their investors, rather than long term value for clients. These funds, which operate on short investment windows, do not have the time or incentive to make material investments in technology, the client experience, or tools to support brokers.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Our model is different. We have the resources, commitment, and know-how to create the brokerage that is truly built for the 21st century. A brokerage where we build our own technology and software in-house, where innovation is our mantra, and where improving outcomes and experiences for our clients is an obsession. While weâ€™ve learned a great deal over the past three years (and made plenty of mistakes along the way!), our founding thesis hasnâ€™t changed -- <strong><em>that the future of our industry combines experts with technology to better serve clients</em></strong>.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Today we are a team of nearly 200, proudly serving over 5,000 clients across nearly every industry. While we are still only beginning our journey, our book already puts us in the top 100 brokerages in America. And weâ€™re just getting started.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, you probably realize that you have to wear many hats and simultaneously juggle many balls. Building and running a successful business requires you to be a developer, a marketer, customer support, and everything else that a business may need to survive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But let me ask you a question. Of all those hats I mentioned, which one you wear the most? Well, if you have a technical background and know-how to code -like myself-, I bet it's the developer's hat. If you are aware of this and don't mind, simply because you enjoy coding and building a profitable business is not your highest priority, you probably don't need to read the rest of this article.<br></p><p>However, if profitability&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;your priority, but coding still takes +90% of your time, then maybe it's worth pausing for a minute to ask yourself, why? For me, that's the case. Coding takes a big chunk of my time. I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it. So it seems like spending my time coding is a "choice", at least, this is what I thought.<br></p><p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/sunday-tldr/themed-days">implementing themed days (newsletter email)</a>, I set a deadline for myself on Saturday to post on Reddit to promote my startup, Hatchy. I procrastinated on that for two weeks by then, so I promised myself that I would post no matter what, and I won't care if the product was ready.<br></p><p>Saturday came, and I kept my promise. I posted, and I received some excellent feedback, but also some critics. That's normal; what was interesting to me is the feeling I had every time I opened Reddit or IndieHackers to check the comments. I felt sick, stressed like I'm about to go naked on stage to deliver a speech. It's my fear of public embarrassment. That bit was kind of clear to me, but what it has to do with coding? I didn't make the connection straight away, but later on I&nbsp;read this:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>As Voltaire once wrote, "The best is the enemy of the good."<p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they're not the same. When you're in motion, you're planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don't produce a result.</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that's motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that's action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that's motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that's action.</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn't matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you're looking to achieve.</p><p>If motion doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen.&nbsp;<strong>And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</strong>" </p><p>- Atomic Habits, James Clear</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>It was the "aha!" moment. Coding is my motion. It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress. You keep adding new features, fixing bugs, and re-styling your landing page, thinking to yourself how much progress you made. When I fact, you are just procrastinating on all the other important stuff.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In August, Chris McCormick shared a shocking post on IndieHackers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174" target="_blank">Only ~1% of 17,207 people who have joined Indie Hackers makes more than $2k MRR</a>. Of course, the data is not 100% accurate, but that doesn't discard that it's so hard and takes a long time for a solo founder to build a sustainable business. But maybe there is more to that than just the fact it's hard.<br></p><p>What if you are stuck on the "coding wheel"? What if it's taking so long not only because it takes time to build but also because you systematically slip into motion rather than taking action? What if you keep yourself busy coding to delay failure and, as a result, delay success?</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

Despite the current situation, this hasn’t changed much. At the time of this writing, I submitted 439 different proposals to 215 unique conferences in 2020.</p> <p>I already wrote <a href="https://blog.frankel.ch/advices-junior-conference-speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some advice for junior conference speakers</a>. As a follow-up, I’d like to offer my view on the organization of conferences, from my speaker’s point-of-view. While the online and the on-site experiences are quite different, most of my feedback applies to both.</p> <div> <h2 id="do-send-approval-letters">DO send approval letters</h2> <div> <p>Let’s start easy. Just send approval emails when you’ve made the decision. It feels weird to learn about one’s acceptance from the conference website.</p> <p>For the record, it’s not a theoretical point. It happened to me on more than one occasion. Weird.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-send-rejection-letters">DO send rejection letters</h2> <div> <p>It goes without saying, but we need to plan our speaking gigs. I’m talking about travel and accommodation, but not only. Time spent at the conference is time that is not spent somewhere else:</p> <ul><li><span>if one is an employee, one needs to ask one’s boss</span></li><li><span>if one is a consultant, one needs to let know the customer about one’s time away</span></li><li><span>if one speaks professionally, choosing between conferences set during the same timeframe</span></li><li><span>etc.</span></li></ul> <p>Letting rejected speakers know about their status <strong>as early as possible</strong> allow them to plan depending on their respective situations.</p> <p>Please provide the date limit for which you’ll send acceptance/rejection letters along with the Call for Papers…​ and stick to it! It feels unpleasant to have to reach out to organizers to query one’s status after the date has passed.</p> <p>On the other side, I understand organizers might want to keep some options in case selected speakers cancel their attendance. But then, please be upfront about it, and communicate it straightforwardly: let speakers choose whether they accept this option or not.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-offer-feedback-on-rejections">DO offer feedback on rejections</h2> <div> <p>I get it, organizing a conference is a lot of work. Really. However, sending a rejection email with the same auto-generated statement sends a bad signal. Here’s a sample of the email I receive:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>We’re sorry to inform you that your proposal <em>REDACTED</em> for <em>REDACTED</em> was refused.</p> <p>Do keep in mind that we received over <em>X</em> proposals and the available slots are very limited!</p> <p>We would like to thank you sincerely for your proposal and shown interest.</p> <p>If you’re interested in purchasing a ticket for the conference we are happy to offer you a <em>Y%</em> discount using the following URL.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>It feels as if you care no more about speakers, once you’ve rejected their proposal(s). And still, this year’s rejected speakers could be next year’s accepted speakers.</p> <p><strong>If</strong> the selection process has been transparent, why don’t you provide the data you based your decision on? A bare minimum is to provide the feedback upon request. But it’s better if you send it along with the rejection email.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="dont-force-presentation-templates">DON’T force presentation templates</h2> <div> <p>Some conferences want to provide a sense of unity to presentations. For that reason, they provide a presentation template that speakers need to apply to each slide of their deck. It’s not a good idea:</p> <ol><li><span>Most templates are <strong>not</strong> templates. They are just slide decks. Hence, every speaker needs to copy-paste one’s content into the provided "template", then adapt it. I believe that the time I spend on this can be better spent rehearsing or digging deeper, or whatever.</span></li><li><span>I know at least the following widespread presentation software/stacks: Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, Google Slides, and Reveal.JS. It means organizers need to provide templates for them. Again, don’t you have anything else to spend your time on?</span></li></ol> <p>If your marketing team thinks this is important, there’s a much easier way. Just set a border on the screen where you display the slides - see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwcjOhD91Q0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it in action</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-organize-a-speakers-dinner">DO organize a speakers' dinner</h2> <div> <p>Among the benefits of being a speaker is the networking part: you get to meet interesting people, talk to them, know them and sometimes, keep in touch. This is only made possible because organizers take some time (and money?) to organize a time for speakers to mingle together.</p> <p>It’s a big miss if there’s no such time…​ and it removes a huge benefit of speaking at conferences.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-provide-a-quiet-room">DO provide a quiet room</h2> <div> <div> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <i title="Note"></i> </td> <td> Obviously, the following items are not meant for online conferences. But the pandemics are not going to last forever. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </div> <p>Some speakers I know of travel <em>a lot</em>. Providing a room where they can rest is basic care.</p> <p>I didn’t use the term "speakers room", but "quiet room" on purpose: Speakers are not special snowflakes that need to be protected from the crowd. I’m not against a dedicated speakers' room if one is available. But the most important property is that it must be <strong>quiet</strong>.</p> <p>There’s one more requirement: provide enough power plugs so that speakers can recharge their laptops (and phones), for this conference - and potentially the next one(s).</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-provide-wifi">DO provide Wifi</h2> <div> <p>I benefit from a great mobile phone plan, with 25Gb data across all European countries plus several other countries. Otherwise, I know that not every mobile company has such a plan.</p> <p>For this reason, it’s useful to provide a free <strong>reliable</strong> Wifi. There should be one dedicated to speakers so that it can deliver data with acceptable speed. If the Wifi is open to everyone, the risk is that a lot of attendees will connect and make the network unusable. Note that it doesn’t prevent the conference to provide two Wifi networks, one for speakers and one for attendees.</p> <p>Extra points if the password is available on the badge, or in the speakers' room. While it seems to be a great idea to send the password by email, speakers receive a lot of emails, and there’s a high chance they will overlook it. The lesson here is that it’s not enough to give the right data, you should provide it at the right time.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-have-a-dedicated-speakers-registration-desk">DO have a dedicated speakers' registration desk</h2> <div> <p>I already wrote that speakers are not special snowflakes. Let me reinstate it here. And yet, we do have specific constraints.</p> <p>It’s not uncommon to rush directly from the airport to the venue, just in time for our talk. If we need to queue, we might be running late, which is bad for everybody: speaker, attendees, and organizers.</p> <p>Hence, a dedicated registration queue is more than appreciated, it’s necessary. Even better, give out the badges at the speakers' dinner, or send an email with a QR code ahead of time.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-have-a-dedicated-speakers-lunch-queue">DO have a dedicated speaker’s lunch queue</h2> <div> <p>For the same reason, I’d recommend having a dedicated speaker’s queue for lunch. In general, I am always stressed to be on time. This is worse if the conference scheduled my talk in the slot just after lunchtime: having to queue for ages and see the clock ticking won’t make my talk better, far from it.</p> <p>This is worse if the food is bad…​ Sorry, I’m French.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="dodont-rank-talks">DO/DON’T rank talks</h2> <div> <p>Ranking talks is good, depending on what one wants to achieve. In my experience, I’ve seen two reasons:</p> <div> <dl> <dt>Provide feedback to the speaker, in the spirit of continuous improvement</dt> <dd> <p>As a speaker, I care most about that. There’s always room for improvement, and I can get better if I get the right feedback. In that case, grades are useless: comments are the most useful way to get this feedback.</p> <p>Yes, I understand that most attendees won’t leave any comment at all, but I prefer a couple of worthwhile comments instead of all the room leaving good grades.</p> </dd> <dt>Competition</dt> <dd> <p>Who doesn’t want to have the best talk at a conference, or at least be in the top X? I, for sure, love when it happens. Yet, at the same time, I must admit it brings nothing but a nice rub on my ego.</p> <p>As conference organizers, if you want to provide a grading system, make it at least fair. For example, I’ve had experienced the following: the grading system discards the votes where there are less than 20 votes. That seems like a good idea because lower numbers mean they are not representative. Now, as conference organizers, you schedule the most well-known speakers in the biggest room, with a 300 seats' capacity. Other rooms have 50 seats' capacity. But it’s nearly impossible to have 20 votes out of 50 people - provided the room is full.</p> <p>As a consequence, only talks that took place in the 300 seats' room can compete. This is the poster child for self-fulfilling prophecies: the organizers were right to put those talks in this room!</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-expense-speakers">DO expense speakers</h2> <div> <p>This last point might be the most controversial. But what would be a conference without speakers? Shouldn’t they be cared for? This requires a bit of context.</p> <p>First, is the conference community-based or commercial? Or to put it more bluntly, is the conference’s main goal to make money, or not? In the first case, it stands to reason to help speakers by reimbursing their travels and accommodations expenses and even paying for their time. If community-based conferences that charge attendees a low fee can reimburse, what reason would money-oriented ones invoke not to?</p> <p>Then, there’s the profile of the speaker. Speaking is now my job, but before that, I took time off to speak at conferences. If I used my own free time to speak at your conference, why would I also pay for travel and accommodation?</p> <p>Some conferences consider themselves above that: they attract enough good speakers as it is. That’s fine…​ if you belong to that exclusive club. If not, then my advice would be to think about your speakers' compensation scheme and to be transparent about it.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="do-rotate-speakers">DO rotate speakers</h2> <div> <p>I understand that some speakers are so good that it’s a hard choice for conference organizers to do without them. These speakers attract attendees who are the measure of the success of a conference.</p> <p>On the flip side, for some conferences, only the names of the talk change from year to year. Speakers are the same. Think that it becomes perhaps boring to watch the same speaker, even the greatest ones, at one point or another.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <div> <p>Most of the advice above should be common sense. It feels redundant having to write it. But it’s not.</p> <p>If you’re a conference organizer, I’d be grateful if you took some …</p></div></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I recently spent quite a bit of time setting up an Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster on AWS. Creating all the required resources from scratch was a bit more involved than I’d hope for so it left me wondering if there was a better way for developers who want on-demand containers without having to set up and manage the networking infrastructure and resources required to start working with ECS.</p>
<p>So, I figured let’s give Azure Container Instances a try! I think it worked out pretty well. Let’s take a closer look, if you prefer the Tweet-consumable version of this, I also made a thread on my experience with it:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tweeting my first look at <a href="https://twitter.com/Azure?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@azure</a> container instances, I was fed up with having to literally create dozens of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AWS</a> networking resources to get a single ECS container running so let's see how <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Azure?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Azure</a> does it!</p>— Fernando (@fmc_sea) <a href="https://twitter.com/fmc_sea/status/1313634251196096512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>For this demo, I assume you already have an Azure subscription and you have the Azure CLI setup on your machine and that you have a little experience with Docker but I don’t directly use it in this guide.</p>
<h2 id="creating-our-first-azure-container-instance">Creating Our First Azure Container Instance</h2>
<p>The first thing we do is to create a resource group that our container will be put in. We can do this from the Azure CLI with:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az group create <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--location westus
</code></pre></div><p>Then I just create the container? After coming from ECS that seems… too easy? But let’s try it using the default image that Azure gives us in the docs and trying to claim my snazzy <code>fernando</code> subdomain:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container create <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld <span>\
</span><span></span>--dns-name-label fernando <span>\
</span><span></span>--ports <span>80</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For me, the command stalled for about 60 seconds before it provided a <code>- Running ...</code> prompt to me. Seems like a weird experience to wait on a CLI command, I’d expect it to register the command and then I could check on the status but I supposed this isn’t a bad thing as I’m probably going to want to know when it finishes.</p>
<p>Presumably there’s some sort of <code>--dont-show-me-the-status-just-create-it-and-ill-check-later</code> flag I don’t know about to solve problems with scripting this out. What’s that you say? It’s <code>--no-wait</code>? Ahh. Well, yeah I suppose that makes more sense.</p>
<p>One confusing part is that the documentation says I’m supposed to check on the result with this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container show <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--query <span>"{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>--out table
</code></pre></div><p>So this part was a bit confusing. Do I need to wait and then run the command? Or can I just wait as it seems like it’s ready when it finishes?</p>
<p>When I do run the show command it returns the ProvisioningState of my container:</p>
<pre><code>FQDN                               ProvisioningState
---------------------------------  -------------------
fernando.westus.azurecontainer.io  Succeeded
</code></pre><p>HAH! I totally snagged the <code>fernando</code> subdomain - Sorry other Fernandos in the West US - I GOT HERE FIRST! With this provisioned, let’s check it out.</p>
<p><img src="https://fernandomc.com/images/azure-container-instances/azure-container-instance-demo-app.png" alt="Screenshot of Azure Container Instance Demo App"></p>
<p>A beautiful, pretty boring demo app. But there is some magic in that I only had to run <strong>two commands</strong> to get it up.</p>
<p>Getting this same damn thing with AWS ECS took me about twenty minutes of configuring a VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Internet Gateway, ECS Cluster and Task and some other things I probably forgot.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-our-azure-container-instance">Customizing Our Azure Container Instance</h2>
<p>Ok so what if I want something more interesting in here though. I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia">Theia</a> recently for other tinkering so let’s see how hard it is to get a custom Docker image up as a Container Instance.</p>
<p>We could probably just run the same commands as before and replace the image name with the Docker image name I want right? Let’s give it a shot:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container create <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--image theiaide/theia-python:latest <span>\
</span><span></span>--dns-name-label fernando-theia <span>\
</span><span></span>--ports <span>80</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After 3 minutes and 35 seconds (yes I timed you Azure Container Instances team!) the CLI told me the container instance was up and running. To get the new domain name again I used:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container show <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--query <span>"{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>--out table
</code></pre></div><p>And here we are:</p>
<pre><code>FQDN                                     ProvisioningState
---------------------------------------  -------------------
fernando-theia.westus.azurecontainer.io  Succeeded
</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, I clearly don’t know how to use Theia at all so loading the container at that URL timed out. Possibly because I need to configure a different port.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, there is no <code>az container update</code> which is mildly confusing but I supposed I can just try the create command again with a new port number and hope for the best!</p>
<pre><code>az container create \
--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances \
--name fmc-theia-container \
--image theiaide/theia-python:latest \
--dns-name-label fernando-theia \
--ports 3000
</code></pre><p>I love it when guesses work out! It appears like this operation worked and it only took ~10 seconds as opposed to the actual creation of the container instance which was a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="checking-azure-container-instance-logs">Checking Azure Container Instance Logs</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, even though my configuration now appears to expose TCP traffic on port 3000 I’m still unable to get any response. Let’s see what’s happening under the hood:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container logs --resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container
</code></pre></div><p>Ahh the logs! Here’s what’s going on:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">yarn run v1.22.4
$ /home/theia/node_modules/.bin/theia start /home/project --hostname<span>=</span>0.0.0.0
root INFO Configuration directory URI: <span>'file:///root/.theia'</span>
root INFO Configuring to accept webviews on <span>'.+.webview..+'</span> hostname.
root WARN The directory referenced by local-dir:/root/.theia/plugins does not exist.
root WARN The directory referenced by local-dir:/root/.theia/extensions does not exist.
root INFO Theia app listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000.

... There were more logs but I cut them out because you can only look at so many lines

root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"xml@1.39.1-prel"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-builtin-xml/extension"</span>
root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"yaml@1.39.1-prel"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-builtin-yaml/extension"</span>
root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"EditorConfig@0.14.4"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-editorconfig/extension/out/editorConfigMain.js"</span>
root INFO Deploying backend plugin <span>"python@2020.1.58038"</span> from <span>"/home/theia/plugins/vscode-python/extension/out/client/extension"</span>
root INFO Deploy plugins list took: 337.3 ms
</code></pre></div><p>Basically, it appears like Theia is configured with 0.0.0.0 with port 3000 and from the command I ran earlier I know port 3000 should be exposed? This, in combination with the long list of installation logs and out means that in all likelihood I just didn’t wait long enough for all these dependencies to install.</p>
<p>After visiting the link again I now have the Theia container running and functioning as I expected:</p>
<p><img src="https://fernandomc.com/images/azure-container-instances/theia.png" alt="Screenshot of Theia container running in my browser"></p>
<p>It comes prebuilt with Node and Python, perfect for some messing around with and integrating in later projects.</p>
<h3 id="custom-port-mapping">Custom Port Mapping</h3>
<p>But what if I’m not a fan of making myself go to port 3000 when I visit this? In other systems I might be able to set up some port mapping from port 3000 to port 80 so I can visit the domain without the port suffix.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it appears in <a href="https://feedback.azure.com/forums/602224-azure-container-instances/suggestions/34082284-support-for-port-mapping">this Azure Feedback post</a> that there is no support for anything other then symmetrical port mapping. This means I either have to modify my container or be satisfied with port 3000. Ahh well! Another day.</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up</h2>
<p>Finally, time to make sure I clean up my resources so I’m not paying for them:</p>
<p>Delete the theia container group:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container delete <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-theia-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances
</code></pre></div><p>Delete the first demo container group:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az container delete <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-container <span>\
</span><span></span>--resource-group fmc-rg-container-instances
</code></pre></div><p>Delete the resource group:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">az group delete <span>\
</span><span></span>--name fmc-rg-container-instances
</code></pre></div><p>Remember to answer <code>y</code> to those prompts.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I found getting started here pretty fun. I do have some option questions that I might dive into in later posts. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the distinction between containers and container groups? How do these function together/separately?</li>
<li>Are there other resources here that I need to be aware of in order to clean them up after? (Hopefully no?)</li>
<li>How do I integrate applications in these containers with other Azure services?</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall though, I find this model of deploying containers a lot more intuitive and simple to get started with. Do you want to see more about Azure or about Azure Container Instances? Leave a comment below or reach out to me and let me know!</p>

                    <h3>VED-X: A Versatile Event Detection Framework</h3>
               </p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>VED-X is a novel Few Shot Learning framework capable of learning specific visual events (as opposed to objects only)
                        using only a few samples. To train a model that can recognize an event, the user needs to provide only a few positive
                        samples (snapshots of when the event is happening) and a few negative samples (snapshots of when
                        the event is not happening.) The trained model can then recognize the event
                        with a good accuracy and if the model makes a mistake (false positive/false negative), the
                        user can flag the mistake. The user's feedback is then incorporated into the model and the model keeps
                        getting better over time.</p>
                    <p>First, watch some of <strong><a href="#examples"><u>our pre-recorded demos</u></a></strong> to see how it works.
                        Then run a live experiment using a webcam (on desktop) below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The model learns your event of interest based on your given samples only. At a high level,
                        it tries to guess your event of interest by finding the most distinct aspects of the
                        positive samples that are not present in the negative samples. So the main
                        distinction between your positive and negative samples must be your event of interest.
                    </li><li>The trained model is capable of generalizing to a good degree. In other words, it is robust to
                         some variations it has not seen in the training samples. However, depending on the event, some
                         variations might reduce the accuracy. Adding more diversity to your samples increases
                         the model's robustness to new variations.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the main difference between your positive and negative samples is your event of
                        interest, otherwise the model might focus on a different aspect. For example, if your event is
                        "person riding a bike" and in most of your negative samples, there is no person or bike, the model may think
                        "person appearing" or "bike appearing" is your event of interest.
                    </li><li>Your event of interest&nbsp;must be visible in all your positive samples. Currently, we are streaming at
                        a low resolution (400px by 400px), so your event must be clearly visible at that resolution.</li>
                    <li>We recommend using Chrome or Firefox to run a live demo. Some functionalities may not work as
                        expected on some of the other web browsers.</li>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the model incorporate temporal behavior?<br>Currently, the model is limited to static events,
                        i.e. events that can be characterized by only one snapshot. We have found this covers most visual
                        events of interest.</li>
                    <li>Can I train a model to recognize a specific person?<br>The model is not capable of learning
                        the distinct facial features very accurately but it can distinguish between people with different
                        appearances.</li>
                    <li>Can the models run at the edge?<br>It would be
                        possible to deploy the models at the edge depending on the hardware specifications and the desired performance.</li>
                    <li>How can I access the API?<br>Please, email us at founders@visualone.tech for access to the API.

<p>Docker is an OS-level virtualization technology that can help you build and run containers. It makes it easy to package your code into containers with all the necessary components to run anywhere with Docker Engine installed. Unlike virtual machines, containers do not require you to install Guest-OS. Containers run on a single operating system using much fewer resources than virtual machines, making containers a much lighter weight solution.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, Docker allows you to package your application with all the dependencies into a container. Docker also keeps track of each container image you build and versions them for you, much like version control systems such as Git. And since every container is a standardized portable file, you can be sure that your application will run 100% the same on any machine.</p>

<p>With Docker, the headache of managing your application in different environments, such as development and production, is significantly reduced. Because a docker image contains the complete runtime environment and dependencies for your application to run, it solves the dreaded developer problem of “it works on my machine.”</p>

<p>A Docker Container Image is a portable, executable package containing your application code, runtime, libraries, and everything required for your application to run smoothly and securely. Many people use the words image and container interchangeably; however, they are not the same thing. You can think of an image as a blueprint for architectural design or a meal recipe.</p>

<p>A Docker Container or simply Container is the result or finished product of your blueprint or recipe. In technical terms, It’s the name given to a running instance of your docker container image. You can launch multiple container instances from one container image, much like how you can create several meals using the same recipe.</p>

<p>Suppose a container is a result or final product of a recipe or blueprint. In that case, Dockerfile is the instructions on how to put that final product or recipe together. Dockerfile contains the complete instructions on how Docker should build your container image, which resources and assets to include, the ports that the container exposes, etc. It’s a step by step definition file on how to construct a container image.</p>

					<div>
						<p>The question of how scientific advances flow through to practical applications is central to our understanding of progress, and guides research funding policy.</p>
<p>The tone on this issue for the second half of the 20th century was set in 1945 by Vannevar Bush’s landmark report “<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm">Science, the Endless Frontier</a>”. One theme, already widely accepted in American industrial culture and given official voice in Bush’s report, was that basic research, although not guided by practical uses, is nonetheless necessary for long-term progress:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basic research is performed without thought of practical ends. … The scientist doing basic research may not be at all interested in the practical applications of his work, yet the further progress of industrial development would eventually stagnate if basic scientific research were long neglected.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the early 1950s, the newly created National Science Foundation was justifying its mission based on an explicit model of technological development as a flow from basic research through to development. Quoting from the NSF’s <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1952/annualreports/ar_1952_sec2.pdf">second annual report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technological sequence consists of basic research, applied research, and development… each of the successive stages depends upon the preceding. Unlimited expansion of effort toward applied research and development, without corresponding support for basic research, will defeat the entire effort by limiting technological progress to minor improvements and refinements of obsolete processes and equipment.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is an important truth in this “linear model” of innovation. But there is also much more interaction between science and invention than a naive interpretation of the model would imply.</p>
<p>The truth in the model is that science is, in an important sense, the foundation for invention. The <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/why-ac-won">electric power industry</a> would not have been possible before the science of electromagnetism: Michael Faraday’s 1831 discovery that a moving magnet creates a current in a nearby wire is the law that the electric generator, deployed widely decades later, depends on. Plastics were not created until chemistry was well-established: the first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was created by a Belgian-American chemist, Leo Baekeland, after <a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakelite.html#invention-of-bakelite">careful experimentation</a> inspired by the potential of phenol-formaldehyde compounds established by previous researchers.</p>
<p>Technological development is possible through ad-hoc tinkering, but without a scientific base, such development eventually plateaus. Sanitation reformers made only limited progress against disease before the germ theory, because they were guided only by perceptible qualities such as the look, smell, and taste of the water supply. The understanding that microbes were the cause of disease refined their understanding of the goal and gave them new ways to measure the success of their efforts. It was after this, for example, that <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/draining-the-swamp">chlorination was added to water treatment</a>, and pasteurization to food processing.</p>
<p>Practical applications often flow naturally from science: a deeper understanding of nature suggests possible uses. But science does not flow from applications, because it is not obvious <i>what </i>science might apply to a given problem. As <a href="https://gemenne.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/nelson-basic-economics-of-scientific-research.pdf">Richard Nelson pointed out</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is seriously to be doubted whether X-ray analysis would ever have been discovered by any group of scientists who, at the turn of the century, decided to find a means for examining the inner organs of the body … It seems most unlikely that a group of scientists in the mid-nineteenth century, attempting to develop a better method of long-range communication, would have developed Maxwell’s equations and radio.</p></blockquote>
<p>The impact of science on invention is long-term and often impossible to foresee. There are some times, certainly, when scientific pursuits have obvious applications: when Robert Koch identified the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis, he must have known that this would someday help us prevent or cure the disease. But when Bohr peered into the structure of the atom, or when Rutherford and Curie investigated the nature of radiation, it is doubtful that they expected their work to lead to nuclear power or MRI scans.</p>
<p>Investments in science, then, if motivated by long-term progress, cannot be prioritized by immediate practical impact. It requires, in Bush’s words, “the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown.”</p>
<p>However, in the naive interpretation of this model, the stages are fully distinct, non-overlapping, and separated by a clean handoff. Science is pursued out of pure curiosity, with no thought of applications. It discovers elegant natural laws, which are crisply formulated, written down, and then thrown over the transom to engineering. Invention is then a straightforward process of deductively applying these laws to practical problems.</p>
<p>But the relationship between science and invention is not one-way. It is reciprocal.</p>
<p>Invention is rarely, if ever, a pure deduction from established physical laws. Inventors tinker, often right at the boundaries of scientific knowledge—where the best opportunities are. Edison famously tested thousands of materials as filaments for his light bulb to find one that would last long enough to make the bulb economical. Charles Goodyear <a href="https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/charles-goodyear">experimented for many years</a> to create an improved form of rubber that would not become soft in the heat or brittle in the cold, finally hitting on pressure-treating with sulfur as the key process to create what he would call “vulcanized”&nbsp;rubber. Even today, drugs are discovered by screening thousands of compounds against a target.</p>
<p>Science, of course, often <i>guides</i> this experimentation. Edison was specifically <a href="http://edison.rutgers.edu/lamp.htm">looking for a high-resistance material</a>; he knew from his understanding of the physics of electric circuits that a high-resistance bulb would require less power. Drug compounds, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2790789/">including some early antibiotics</a>, are discovered by modifying “side chains” of a known molecule. Without scientific background knowledge, pure tinkering often has too many possibilities to explore; science narrows the search.</p>
<p>Sometimes when an invention is produced by tinkering, science cannot explain its operating characteristics, or even why it works at all. Aspirin was first marketed in 1899, but its mechanism of action <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20631416/">wasn’t explained until 1971</a>. These cases can inspire new theories or even entire new fields. The field of thermodynamics was created in the 1800s in part to explain the working of heat engines, such as the steam engines that had been invented in the previous century. A better scientific understanding of technology then helps us optimize or expand it. The first vaccine, for smallpox, was <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/smallpox-and-vaccines">invented in 1796</a>, but no one was able to replicate this success for any other disease until almost ninety years later, after the advent of the germ theory.</p>
<p>When the right researchers are brought together in the right environment, this iterative process combining both science and engineering can even be driven forward by the same people, in the same lab, on a single project. A dramatic example is <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/transistors-science-and-invention">the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs</a>. Researchers went back to the drawing board multiple times to improve the theory of semiconductor physics, in order to explain their experimental results. Each improvement to the theory let them make the next advance in engineering: from failed prototypes, to the first working “point-contact” transistor, to the improved “junction” transistor that became the standard design.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest researchers were those who were able to pivot rapidly from discovery to invention, or vice versa, as the opportunity arose. The master of this was <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/louis-pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, a pioneer of microbiology. Some of his greatest scientific discoveries came from projects with purely practical, commercial goals. His work to improve the processes of wine, beer, and vinegar makers led to the discovery of anaerobic metabolism and the role of microbes in fermentation; his assistance to the growers of silk worms gave him observations that ultimately led to the germ theory of disease. At other times, while engaged in scientific research, Pasteur was able to seize on an accidental discovery when he saw its practical applications. This is how a botched experiment with chicken cholera led to <a href="https://www.vbivaccines.com/wire/louis-pasteur-attenuated-vaccine/">the first laboratory-created vaccines</a>, including a vaccine for rabies.</p>
<p>So the “clean handoff” model is wrong. Instead, we should replace it with a “gap” model. Science gives inventors a conceptual framework: a toolbox of categories, principles, and equations that provide fertile ground for practical experimentation. But through experimentation, inventors can discover working solutions outside the bounds of what has been fully explained by science. They can’t get <i>too </i>far ahead of scientific understanding—Bell Labs would never even have created a semiconductor research group if physics hadn’t first identified semiconductors as a material.</p>
<p>But if the distance between known science and a desired invention is short enough, they can cross the gap. They can bridge the gap with their own experiments, extending scientific knowledge; or they can leap over it, ending up with an invention that works for reasons yet to be explained. Leaping the gap can actually pull science forward, giving it new phenomena to explore and new motivation to do so.</p>
<p>As a consequence, influence does not flow in one direction only, from science to invention. Invention feeds back into science, and rapid progress can come from a tight integration of the two.</p>
<p>Our assumptions about how research happens guide how we fund, organize, and manage it.</p>
<p>The great corporate laboratories of the early 20th century, which integrated basic research and product development under one roof, <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-american-rd-lab/">have gone into decline</a>. Today the people, projects, and institutions who do science and invention are more separate than they were in those days. Startups and venture capitalists mostly don’t do …</p></div></div></div>

<p>John McCain was in a wistful mood.</p>



<p>It was the spring of 2017 and I was visiting him for what would turn out to be the final time in his Senate office on Capitol Hill.</p>



<p>After catching me up on the latest in our home state of Arizona, McCain turned to another of his passions: Europe. The senator had just returned from a swing through the Balkans (spending time in one of Tito’s hunting lodges, among other places) and he was worried that neither Washington nor the Europeans were paying enough attention to the security situation there and the broader region, especially regarding the threat posed by Russia. What about the Germans, I asked, knowing how frustrated McCain had been with Berlin’s stance on Russia over the years. (In 2015, McCain, enraged over Berlin’s refusal to help arm Ukraine, <a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-02/ukraine-angela-merkel-john-mccain-kritik-waffen?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com" target="_blank">said</a> Angela Merkel’s course reminded him of “the policies of the 1930s,” a reference to the U.K.’s ill-fated appeasement strategy towards Hitler). </p>



<p>McCain, who never abandoned the vernacular of his fighter-pilot days, cracked a mischievous smile.</p>



<p>“The fucking Germans,” he laughed. “What is there to say?”</p>



<p>Were he still alive, McCain would no doubt have plenty to say about the foreign policy trajectory of Merkel’s government in recent years.</p>



<p>Since McCain’s death in 2018, Germany has refused to back the U.S. on just about every major foreign policy front, whether concerning China, Russia, Iran, Israel or the broader Middle East.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Berlin continues to fall short of NATO defense spending targets and the defense ministry’s procurement practices — in recent days it had to scrap plans to order a new standard-issue <a href="https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/bundeswehr-selects-haenel-mk-556-assault-rifle-to-replace-g36" target="_blank">assault rifle</a> over a patent dispute — remain a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-biggest-enemy-threadbare-army-bundeswehr/">comedy of errors</a>.</p>



<p>It’s tempting to blame this new transatlantic divide on Donald Trump, his <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/donald-trump-nato-not-obsolete-237166" target="_blank">questioning</a> of NATO’s purpose and his bizarre love-hate <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/24/how-trump-made-war-on-angela-merkel-and-europe" target="_blank">obsession</a> with both Merkel and Germany, the land of his forebears.</p>



<p>McCain, no fan of Trump’s, would no doubt join that chorus. But he would also likely point out that the underlying divisions predate Trump and cut to a more fundamental question: Whose side is Germany on anyway?</p>



<p>No one on either side of the Atlantic is even trying to paper over the deep differences in the relationship anymore. I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/MKarnitschnig/status/1313770388392943616?s=20" target="_blank">asked</a> Christian Lindner, the leader of Germany’s Free Democrats, an ostensibly pro-American party, what his expectations for the German-American partnership were. His reply: “What transatlantic relationship are you referring to still?”</p>



<p>With German-American relations at their lowest ebb since World War II, McCain’s frustration with German policy offers a reminder that the American transatlantic establishment’s exasperation with Germany runs deep and is bipartisan. Trump’s outrageous taunts have prompted many Germans to forget that Barack Obama also pressured Berlin to spend more on defense. Indeed, the first president to criticize the Europeans as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/world/middleeast/obama-criticizes-the-free-riders-among-americas-allies.html" target="_blank">free riders</a>” was Obama.</p>



<p>That history suggests that hopes among many in Berlin that U.S.-German ties will somehow revert to the earlier norm if Joe Biden (a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2ab413939e3747215da2c34dcbd323cf" target="_blank">close friend</a> of McCain’s over decades) wins the presidency aren’t just overblown: They’re a fantasy.</p>



<h3>No going back</h3>



<p>One big reason there is no going back is Washington’s focus on China, one of the few areas of bipartisan consensus across the American political divide.</p>



<p>“As U.S. foreign policy becomes increasingly focused on strategic competition with China and subordinates relationships with long-standing allies to that overriding priority, Europe will be faced with difficult choices — whoever is president,” Chatham House’s Hans Kundnani recently <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2020/10/us-foreign-policy-priorities/02-transatlantic-relations" target="_blank">observed</a>.</p>



<p>Yet there’s a more prosaic explanation for why there’s no turning back the transatlantic clock: Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, it has become increasingly difficult to explain to Americans why the country even needs to be in Europe.</p>



<p>This is particularly true of the American military presence in Germany, where the U.S. has anchored its European engagement for decades. Trump’s attacks on Berlin’s modest military spending may trigger outrage in Germany, but in the U.S., they are viewed as among his less controversial outbursts.</p>



<p>That might be because, like Obama before him, he has a point. Why should the U.S. continue to bear the financial brunt of protecting Europe’s richest country? That question becomes even tougher to answer when considering Germany’s continued engagement with Russia — such as via the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/why-germany-cant-say-no-to-nord-stream/">Nord Stream 2</a> gas pipeline — despite the loud objections of the U.S. and other allies.</p>



<p>Last month, Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to the U.S. who is now chairman of the Munich Security Conference, the annual powwow of the transatlantic alliance, <a href="https://www.ardmediathek.de/daserste/video/anne-will/giftanschlag-auf-nawalny-aendert-deutschland-jetzt-seine-russland-politik/das-erste/Y3JpZDovL25kci5kZS8wYzM2ZTdlZi0yMzUzLTRkNjAtOTlkNC04MDJiODE0YWI0NjU/" target="_blank">cautioned</a> against canceling Nord Stream 2 in the wake of Russia’s suspected poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent.</p>



<p>Halting the project would “unleash a triumphant yowl in the Trump administration,” Ischinger told a prime-time audience on German television.</p>



<p>In other words, it was more important to keep Germany’s word to Russia than to hand Trump the appearance of a win, especially after the threats Washington had been making for months to sanction anyone connected with the project. Never mind that the U.S. is supposedly Berlin’s closest ally, with troops and nuclear arms based in Germany to protect it from, of all countries, Russia.</p>



<p>So far, the German government has followed Ischinger’s advice and shown little inclination to abandon the pipeline, a move Berlin worries would further provoke Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>Part of the German calculus in resisting U.S. pressure is a conviction that the U.S. needs Germany almost as much as Germany needs the U.S. </p>



<p>Trump’s “approach comes with damaging consequences, more so for the U.S. than for Germany,” Norbert Röttgen, the chairman of the German parliament’s foreign affairs committee and a conservative candidate to replace Merkel, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-chancellor-candidate-norbert-rottgen/">told</a> me recently, referring to Trump’s decision to reduce the number of U.S. troops in the country by about one-third. “It’s difficult to work with that kind of irrationality.”</p>



<h3>Questionable calculus</h3>



<p>Yet the core of this argument — that the U.S. needs its German presence to “project power” and to carry out <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/catos-letter/endless-war-middle-east" target="_blank">endless wars</a> in the Middle East — is rooted more in the realities of the administration of George W. Bush than what U.S. strategy is likely to look like in the years to come as Washington redirects its focus and resources on the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Despite that strategic shift and the deep tensions in the German-American relationship, saying “Auf Wiedersehen” is far from straightforward. The transatlantic lobby – an alphabet soup of German and American think tanks populated by a motley assortment of academics, retired generals and ambassadors, some on the payroll of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex" target="_blank">military-industrial complex</a>” —&nbsp;is intent on preserving the relationship, come what may. The same is true for many in Congress, including Republicans.</p>



<p>Some observers believe the best way forward would be to “redefine” NATO, by shifting more of the burden to Europe. While Washington has made some progress on this front in recent years, prodding other members to devote more resources to their militaries, the U.S. still accounts for about 70 percent of NATO members’ total defense spending.</p>



<p>“You have to get out of the mindset that this is a protectorate type of relationship … it is corrosive for both sides,” said Dan Hamilton, a prominent American voice on transatlantic affairs who has spent decades rotating between academia and diplomacy on both sides of the Atlantic. “It gives the Americans this kind of patronal attitude towards the Europeans and means the Europeans don’t have to do much.”</p>



<p>Though many Europeans would no doubt welcome that kind of partnership, it’s far from clear that Germans would. Germany, though it has spent more recently, remains a laggard on defense. Indeed, the country’s military is so beset with dysfunction after years of neglect that it is difficult to see a fundamental improvement anywhere on the horizon. Less than half of Germans think military spending should go up, according to a recent <a href="https://securityconference.org/assets/01_Bilder_Inhalte/03_Medien/02_Publikationen/MSC_Germany_Report_10-2020_De.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> by the Munich Security Conference. </p>



<p>Public perceptions of the U.S. in Germany have rarely been worse. Only 26 percent of Germans have a “positive” view of the U.S., according to a Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/09/15/us-image-plummets-internationally-as-most-say-country-has-handled-coronavirus-badly/" target="_blank">study</a> released last month, the lowest rate in any country except Belgium. That contrasts with favorability ratings for the U.S. of between 40 percent and 45 percent in Spain, Italy and the U.K. </p>



<p>A similarly low percentage of Germans (27 percent) considers the U.S. to be the country’s most important military ally, the Munich Security Conference study found. Roughly half of Germans said France is the country’s most important ally.</p>



<p>On a purely objective basis, the findings are staggering. Whether Germans like it or not, the country’s reliance on the U.S. for its security is to all intents and purposes total. </p>



<p>Even if the U.S. goes through with the troop withdrawal, the country will have more troops in Germany than in almost any other country in the world. Their presence — whether their primary purpose is to protect Germany directly or not — adds to the security umbrella also guaranteed by America’s nuclear arsenal.</p>



<p>Though German economic reliance on the U.S. has waned somewhat with China’s rise, America remains Germany’s biggest export market and a key manufacturing hub for the likes of BMW and Siemens. </p>



<p>Most commentators attribute Germans’ dismal opinion of the U.S. to their visceral dislike of Trump. But that’s only part of the story. Americans who believe most Germans feel they still owe the U.S. any gratitude for rehabilitating the country after World War II and for paving the way for reunification are kidding themselves. Even the country’s elites view America as a “frenemy” at best. The recent social …</p></div></div>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>It’s a tool that allows you to enter pinyin and optionally a tone number and shows only the <em>commonly used</em> Chinese characters with this pronunciation.</p>

<p>It allows you to switch between the top 3500 character list (frequently used) or the top 6500 (relatively common),</p>

<p>Some other features include showing or hiding all pinyin pronunciations for the characters, and showing or searching by the index of the character from the source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a>.</p>

<p>It currently only deals with simplified characters, because that’s what the source deals with and what I’m trying to learn.</p>

<p>Note that this is not a comprehensive Chinese learning tool. To learn Chinese you need to learn words, not just characters. Characters are just one layer in the Chinese language, and even full understanding of all Chinese characters would not mean you’ve learned the language.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-made-this">Why I made this</h2>

<p>While learning Chinese, I wanted to get an understanding of which Chinese characters are actually in common use. If you look in a dictionary for a list of Chinese characters, you will get a bewildering amount of characters. Dictionaries try to be comprehensive. Fortunately, most of these are only in historic use.</p>

<p>I wanted to remove the forest of irrelevant (for my purposes) characters and find get a list of ones actually worth investing time into.</p>

<p>I made this to get an overview and easily be able to answer questions like “how many common characters share this pronunciation?”.</p>

<p>I also wanted it to work without having to wait for a web page to load for each query. I made it work using a fully offline search (you download the data when loading the page itself).</p>

<h2 id="sources-and-data">Sources and data</h2>

<p>During my search I found this official list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters">Table of General Standard Chinese Characters</a> made by the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Sadly, this list is a rasterized PDF which does not even contain the pronunciation of these characters.</p>

<p>Still, it seemed like a good authoritative reference of commonly used characters. I started searching around and found a text version of it on <a href="http://xh.5156edu.com/page/z6211m4474j19255.html">this Chinese webpage</a>. While checking the data I found it had some mistakes around characters 3649 to 3668, which I had to fix manually.</p>

<p>To combine this with pronunciation data I found the <a href="ftp://ftp.cuhk.hk/pub/chinese/ifcss/software/data/Uni2Pinyin.gz">Unicode Pinyin Table</a>. I’ve added numerouos pronunciations manually, when I found them missing from that source. I’ve logged my manual edits in <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt">edits-to-hanzi-pinyin.txt</a>. Note that since I’m only a basic Chinese speaker myself, I can’t exclude that there’s likely more mistakes. I’m open to using a more reliable source for pronunciation data if one is available.</p>

<p>Using this data I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.6500.csv</a> and <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv">hanzi-pinyin.3500.csv</a> files which are the source of the Hanzi search tool.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-i-make-this">How did I make this</h2>

<p>Originally I just used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> to search the hanzi-pinyin CSV files, but found it to become cumbersome due to the need to write regular expressions when I just wanted to think about pinyin.</p>

<p>I created the <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/files/cnhz.py">cnhz</a> python script for myself, originally as a simple wrapper to build the grep regexes for me so I could just write pinyin. I then added more features around it.</p>

<p>As it got more useful I thought about how I could make it more accessible for other Chinese learners too. Most of them do not use Linux or have Python installed. I thought of rewriting it in Go to make it a single executable - but found the command line format would be awkward for most people. Also Windows cmd.exe does not support Chinese characters.</p>

<p>I eventually decided to turn it into a webpage. the CSV files were sufficiently small that the entire database could be loaded into the browser’s memory so you could do a completely client side search - making the experience much smoother than loading an online dictionary entry.</p>

<p>Also, because I can easily host it on my own web page, which I pay for anyway, I don’t have any need to add advertisements or anything to make the experience worse.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the page can easily be downloaded and used offline by any learner in case my site goes down or for when you don’t have internet.</p>

<p>I tried to support offline working more by making the site into a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">progressive web app</a>. However, while adding a manifest was easy, I found that to add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service worker</a> (which allows offline caching) - I would have to move all assets including a copy of my main CSS file to /cn/hanzi/. Not having time to figure this out at the moment, I decided to not add service workers for now.</p>

<p>By the way, the <a href="http://localhost:4000/js/hanzi_list.js">hanzi_list.js</a> file was generated from the CSV sources using an <code>awk</code> script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&lt; ../files/hanzi-pinyin-full.csv \
    awk \
    'NR==1 { printf "const hanzi_3500 = \"" }
     NR==3501 { printf "\"; const hanzi_6500 = hanzi_3500 + \"" }
     { print NR","$0"\\n\\" }
     END { print "\";\nconst hanzi_6500_split = hanzi_6500.split(\"\\n\");" }' \
 &gt; ../js/hanzi_list.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I hope you find my <a href="https://www.thomasvanderberg.nl/cn/hanzi">Chinese hanzi tool</a> useful. If you have any questions or want to contact me, see my details below.</p>

October 20, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/runtime-reflection-pt-2">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is Part 2 in our blog series on our experience building a runtime reflection system in Rust for our policy engine, oso. </p>
<p>In Part 1, we built a simple class system, with a metaclass struct called <code>Class</code> to track type information. We also introduced the <code>Instance</code> struct to wrap any object and erase the type using <code>dyn Any</code>. You can find Part 1: dyn Class <a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/rust-reflection-pt-1">here</a>. </p>
<p>In this post, we'll go through how we support accessing arbitrary attributes on our instances at runtime. There are multiple approaches to solving this problem, including the use of traits from the standard library and commonly used crates like <code>serde</code>. We'll talk through the pros and cons of each, and the version we landed on: adding attribute getters.</p>
<h2>Accessing attributes on a struct</h2>
<p>Suppose we have a struct:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo {
    x: u32,
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would like to write the following code in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/polar-syntax.html">Polar</a>, the oso Policy language:</p>
<pre><code>x_is_one(foo: Foo) if
    foo.x = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>and have it check that <code>foo</code> has an attribute called <code>x</code> and that its value is 1.</p>
<h3>What makes this so hard?</h3>
<p>To start with, there is no <code>getattr(foo, "x")</code> equivalent in Rust. And what makes this hard to implement ourselves is that Rust (by default) provides no guarantees about things like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#the-default-representation">the memory layout of a struct</a>. In fact, in some cases will simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts">optimise away the field entirely</a>. Even in debug builds, a debugger might be unable to <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46698">lookup the value of variables</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you haven't <em>explicitly</em> told Rust that you want it to let you access an attribute, you're unlikely to get it.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>Let's start by thinking about the method signature for dynamic access. We would like to take in an <code>Instance</code> and an attribute name (<code>&amp;str</code>), and return a value to the policy engine.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code>Fn(&amp;Instance, &amp;str) -&gt; PolarValue;
</code></pre>

<p>There are actually two distinct places we could conceivably implement this method: on <code>Instance</code>, and in <code>Class</code>.</p>
<p>On one hand, if we implement it directly on <code>Instance</code>, then we don't need to do any more work to look up the class in order to get attributes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we need to store the attributes <em>somewhere</em> so that we can add them to the instance on creation. So we would probably need to store these these on the <code>Class</code> anyway, and then copy them onto the <code>Instance</code>.</p>
<p>It's a subtle distinction, but for us it made more sense to the keep the instance lightweight, and to use the <code>Class</code> to store the attribute lookups. Although in Python its perfectly valid to add attributes to a class on the fly, we have that requirement in neither the host language nor in Polar.</p>
<p>To make the above work, we simply add a method on an <code>Instance</code> to retrieve the class of it, and we can get attributes from there:</p>
<pre><code>impl Instance {
    fn get_class(&amp;self) -&gt; Result&lt;&amp;Class&gt; { ... }

    pub fn get_attribute(&amp;self, name: &amp;str, host: &amp;mut Host) -&gt; crate::Result&lt;Term&gt; {
        let class = self.class(host)?
        class.get_attribute(self, name)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Implementing the getter</h3>
<p>To implement the <code>get_attribute</code> method, we can either implement (a) a method that can fetch <em>all</em> attributes, or (b) a method for each attribute.</p>
<p>We opted for (b), which gives us the most flexibility to decide on a per-attribute basis how the lookup works.  <code>Class</code> stores a map from attribute names to getters:</p>
<pre><code>/// Class definitions
struct Class {
   ...

    /// Map from attribute name to the attribute lookup
    attributes: HashMap&lt;&amp;'static str, AttributeGetter&gt;
}

struct AttributeGetter(Arc&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;Instance) -&gt; PolarValue);
</code></pre>

<p>We've now split the attribute lookup into two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up the getter for the named attribute: <code>(instance, name) → (instance, attributes.get(name)) → (instance, f)</code></li>
<li>Apply the getter method: <code>(instance, f) → f(instance)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A simple example of an attribute getter is the closure <code>|foo: &amp;Foo| foo.x</code> which has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/closure.html">a unique anonymous type</a> – written <code>[closure@&lt;source code location&gt;]</code>   —  and implements the trait <code>Fn(&amp;Foo) -&gt; R</code>. </p>
<p>To store this on the class we need to do some dynamic type mapping again. First, we have in our hands an <code>Instance</code>, not a <code>Foo</code>. We saw in the last post that <code>downcast</code> would allow us to get back to a concrete type. Furthermore we cannot store a function that returns <whatever the="" type="" of="" <code="">foo.x is&gt;. Instead, we make sure to do the conversion back to a <code>PolarValue</code> as part of looking up the attribute.</whatever></p>
<p>To make it a bit easier to create such type-erased functions, and to make it easier for users of oso, the <code>AttributeGetter</code> provides a new method which handles this for them:</p>
<pre><code>impl AttributeGetter {
    pub fn new&lt;T, F, R&gt;(f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        T: 'static,
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        Self(Arc::new(move |receiver: &amp;Instance, host: &amp;mut Host| {
            // get back the original type of the receiver
            let receiver = reveiver.downcast().expect("type error");
            // call the function; convert the result
            f(receiver).map(|res| res.to_polar(host))
        }))
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use this in the builder method:</p>
<pre><code>impl&lt;T: 'static&gt; ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
  pub fn add_attribute_getter&lt;F, R&gt;(mut self, name: &amp;'static str, f: F) -&gt; Self
    where
        F: Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; R,
        R: crate::ToPolar,
    {
        self.attributes.insert(name, AttributeGetter::new(f));
        self
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One nice property of the above is that it's a compile-time error to define an attribute getter for the wrong class! So despite erasing the type when constructing an <code>Instance</code> and later recovering the type dynamically, it's impossible to provide the wrong getter:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0631]: type mismatch in closure arguments
  --&gt; languages/rust/oso/examples/blog.rs:53:14
   |
53 |             .add_attribute_getter("y", |foo: &amp;Bar| foo.y)
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      ----------------- found signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Bar) -&gt; _`
   |              |
   |              expected signature of `for&lt;'r&gt; fn(&amp;'r example_two::Foo) -&gt; _`
</code></pre>

<h3>Trying it out</h3>
<p>Okay, let's see it in action! We'll start with some test setup:</p>
<pre><code>struct Foo { x: u32, }

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    // Setup the host environment
    let polar = crate::Polar::new();
    let mut host = Host::new(Arc::new(polar));

   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we're a runtime class system, we need something to manage these classes at runtime. This is our <code>Host</code> object. <code>Host</code> will be responsible for things like storing class definitions and caching instances. </p>
<p>Next, we define the <code>Foo</code> class:</p>
<pre><code>// builder for defining the Foo class
let foo_class: Class = Class::builder::&lt;Foo&gt;()
    .add_attribute_getter("x", |foo| foo.x)
    .build();
// register the Foo class on the host
host.cache_class(foo_class, "Foo".into()).unwrap();
</code></pre>

<p>We added a simple builder pattern to make it easier to register attributes in bulk, and the built <code>Class</code> is cached on the <code>host</code>.</p>
<p>With the setup done, we can try out accessing attributes dynamically:</p>
<pre><code>let foo_instance: Instance = Instance::new(Foo { x: 1 });
// get the value of "x" from the instance
let get_x = foo_instance.get_attribute("x", &amp;mut host).unwrap();

// check the result is the PolarValue for 1
assert_eq!(get_x, polar_core::term!(1));
</code></pre>

<p>The test looks up the value of "x" on the instance of foo, and compares it to the expected result. Dynamic attributes in action! The returned value is now a Polar term, since in normal operation the return value would be sent to the Polar VM.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is it gives the user a lot of optionality: for cases where the attribute doesn't implement <code>ToPolar</code>, we can handle conversions right in the closure defined. And the implementation itself is super simple.</p>
<p>The main downside of the approach is that it is <em>very</em> manual. For every attribute a user wants to use, they need to add the <code>add_attribute_getter</code> line.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the <code>oso</code> crate, we also provide a derive macro which can handle this. We still make getting attributes an opt-in process, but the code from above becomes:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(PolarClass)]
struct Foo { 
    #[polar(attribute)]
    x: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_get_attribute() {
    ...

    // builder for defining the Foo class
    let foo_class: Class = Foo::get_polar_class();

    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Alternate Approaches</h2>
<p>The approach we outline above suits our needs, but is leveraging virtually nothing from the Rust standard library nor the Rust ecosystem. Is there really nothing out there to address this problem?</p>
<p>We'll take you through a few of the alternatives we tried. Some of them are complementary to the approach we've taken and would be reasonable future additions, others just didn't quite seem to be what we needed.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<h3>Implement <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code></h3>
<p>In some ways, the most direct route we could take would be to use the <code>Index&lt;String&gt;</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html">trait</a>. This is normally used for data structures like <code>Vec,</code> which allow you to index into it with <code>vec[i]</code>, or with <code>HashMap</code>, which allows you to get a key with <code>map[&amp;key]</code>.</p>
<p>The benefit of using a trait from the standard library is that users may get implementations of the trait for "free", e.g., if they are already using a <code>HashMap</code>, then they don't need to do any additional work to define attribute getters that leverage the trait.</p>
<pre><code>impl ClassBuilder&lt;T&gt; {
    fn supports_indexing(mut self) -&gt; Self
    where T: Index&lt;&amp;str&gt;
    {
        self.set_attribute_lookup(|receiver, attr| {
            receiver.index(&amp;attr)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is: what is the output type for <code>Index</code>? We need it to be any type that can be converted back into the Polar core –&nbsp;perhaps <code>Box&lt;dyn ToPolar&gt;</code> or similar. To make that happen, we would be requiring the user to implement a version of <code>Index</code> for their classes, which is unlikely to be something they will want in the rest of their code. Given this, it doesn't seem like there is much benefit to using <code>Index</code>.</p>
<h3><code>serde::Serialize</code></h3>
<p>Whenever we encounter a problem that requires some form of translation, <code>serde</code> comes to mind. </p>
<p>We could require types to implement <code>serde::Serialize</code>. By writing our own custom serializer, this would give us a way to leverage the existing machinery for walking over all the fields of a struct. And the ubiquity of …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Most of the time, to get root on an Android device you will use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk">Magisk</a>. However, there may be cases where Magisk doesn't work or isn't ideal. For example, on IoT or embedded devices that don't have a traditional Android interface.</p><p>In these instances, it might be easiest to interact with the device through adb. Though more often than not adb runs as the lower privileged shell user, and the <code>adb root</code> command doesn't let you elevate permissions. It simply returns a <code>adbd cannot run as root in production builds</code> error.</p><p>If you search around the web you will find various advice telling you to add the <code>ro.debuggable=1</code> setting to the <code>default.prop</code> file, which is supposed to tell adbd it's allowed to run as root. This may work, but if it doesn't it's probably because the version of Android you're using wasn't compiled with the <code>ALLOW_ADBD_ROOT</code> flag, and the adbd code isn't configured to check the <code>ro.debuggable</code> setting.</p><p>Fortunately not all hope is lost. If all else fails, and you have the ability to upload a new boot partition to the device, you should be able to patch the adbd binary to run as root. Regardless of how the rest of the system has been configured.</p><p>Christian Weiske has a great <a href="https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/android-root-adb.htm">post</a> that introduced me to this concept. In my case, I just had to make a few modifications since the version of adbd I had was "newer" (Nougat), and I used a different method for modifying the boot image.</p><p>I'll assume you have already found a way to get a hold of the boot image. This process is highly dependent on the chipset, so you may need to Google around a bit.</p><p>The adbd binary is located in the <code>sbin</code> directory of the boot image. The easiest method I've found for extracting and modifying the boot image is with the <a href="https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/tools.html#magiskboot">magiskboot</a> tool. You can find it in the <a href="https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/">latest Magisk release</a> zip archive. <strong>Note:</strong> you may need to scroll down to find a recent Magisk release, it's not in the manager releases.</p><figure><pre><code>magiskboot unpack boot.img
magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio extract</code></pre><figcaption>Extracting the boot image and ramdisk</figcaption></figure><p>Download a copy of <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> 🐉, create a new project, and import the adbd binary you just extracted. Give it a minute or two to analyze all the code. (if you need Java, try <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html">Amazon's Corretto</a> or <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot">AdoptOpenJDK</a>)</p><p>I found it much easier to figure out what I was looking at by simultaneously reading the Android <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/tags/android-7.1.2_r39/adb/daemon/main.cpp">source code</a>. As Christian points out in his post, it's easiest to search for the <code>Local port disabled</code> string, or <code>0x7d0</code>, which is the shell user's id in hex. This should bring you to the part of the code where adbd switches from root to the shell user. The goal here is to "comment out" that code, so the program never stops running as root.</p><p>Below is the source code we are trying to target in Ghidra.</p><figure><pre><code>// Don't run as root if running in secure mode.
if (should_drop_privileges()) {
    drop_capabilities_bounding_set_if_needed();
    minijail_change_gid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    minijail_change_uid(jail.get(), AID_SHELL);
    // minijail_enter() will abort if any priv-dropping step fails.
    minijail_enter(jail.get());
    D("Local port disabled");
}</code></pre><figcaption>Android source code</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG" alt="" srcset="https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 600w, https://harrisonsand.com/content/images/2020/10/screenshot2-2.PNG 940w"><figcaption>Disassembled / decompiled code (function names renamed to improve readability)</figcaption></figure><p>Basically, we want to remove the calls to <code>minijail_change_gid</code> and <code>minijail_change_uid</code>. This can be done by replacing the bytes with a series of NOP / no operation commands (<code>00 BF</code>).</p><p>Hydra doesn't do a great job at directly modifying ARM binaries, but a generic hex editor should do the trick. I used <a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a>.</p><p>To remove the call to <code>minijail_change_gid</code>, find and replace the following series of bytes:</p><pre><code>4f f4 fa 61 2d f0 3e f9 &lt;- target
00 BF 00 BF 00 BF 00 BF &lt;- replaced with NOPs</code></pre><p>Do the same for <code>minijail_change_uid</code>, and save the patched binary.</p><p>You can use magiskboot to patch your ramdisk, and package up a new boot image. The repack command should create a <code>new-boot.img</code> file, that you can upload back to your Android device.</p><pre><code>magiskboot cpio ramdisk.cpio "add 750 sbin/adbd patched_adbd"
magiskboot repack boot.img</code></pre><p>Assuming all went well, adbd should be running as root!</p><p>Happy hacking 😊</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week HashiCorp launched its <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-waypoint">latest open source project, Waypoint</a>. Waypoint is a tool to streamline the build, deploy, and release workflow for all kinds of applications. Where Terraform focuses on provisioning infrastructure, Waypoint focuses on application deployment.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting new deployment tool. In this post, we are going to take <code>waypoint</code> for a spin and see what it is like to use it.</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before we can dive into <code>waypoint</code>, we need to have a few things set up. First, we are going to use Terraform to create our container image repository and ECS cluster in AWS. So make sure you have <code>terraform</code> configured, <a href="https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html">see these docs for details</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to have our AWS CLI configured. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">These docs show you how to get your CLI configured</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to install <code>waypoint</code>. This can be done a number of ways <a href="https://www.waypointproject.io/downloads">as these docs mention</a>. If you’re on a Mac, you can run these two commands in <code>brew</code> to get it installed.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ brew tap hashicorp/tap
$ brew <span>install</span> hashicorp/tap/waypoint</code></pre></div>
<h3>Setting up our Next.js demo application</h3>
<p>Before we can focus on deployment, we need an actual application to deploy. Let’s create a sample Next.js application that we can deploy via Waypoint.</p>
<p>We are going to make use of <code>create-next-app</code>. You can install it globally via <code>npm install -g create-next-app</code>. We will create our demo application based on the <code>with-typescript</code> example.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ yarn create next-app --example with-typescript waypoint-demo</code></pre></div>
<p>If we go into the <code>waypoint-demo</code> directory and run <code>yarn dev</code> we should have a functioning demo Next.js application living at <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/du6usc371iyny233dv3o.png" alt="Next.js demo application"></p>
<h3>Setting up our Terraform &amp; Waypoint structure</h3>
<p>With our prerequisites out of the way and a demo application to deploy, let’s set up our configuration for Terraform and Waypoint. From the <code>waypoint-demo</code> directory, run the <code>init</code> command via <code>waypoint</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo
$ waypoint init</code></pre></div>
<p>Awesome, we should now see a <code>waypoint.hcl</code> file inside of our <code>waypoint-demo</code> directory.</p>
<p>Waypoint also makes use of a server that you run locally in order for the CLI and GUI to work. This is a bit clunky at the moment but we need to do the following two things to run the Waypoint server locally.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ docker pull hashicorp/waypoint:latest
$ waypoint <span>install</span> --platform<span>=</span>docker -accept-tos
✓ Server container started
Waypoint server successfully installed and configured<span>!</span>

The CLI has been configured to connect to the server automatically. This
connection information is saved <span>in</span> the CLI context named <span>"install-1602801878"</span><span>.</span>
Use the <span>"waypoint context"</span> CLI to manage CLI contexts.

The server has been configured to advertise the following address <span>for</span>
entrypoint communications. This must be a reachable address <span>for</span> all your
deployments. If this is incorrect, manually <span>set</span> it using the CLI <span>command</span>
<span>"waypoint server config-set"</span><span>.</span>

Advertise Address: waypoint-server:9701
HTTP UI Address: localhost:9702</code></pre></div>
<p>The latter step launches the Waypoint server locally using Docker.</p>
<p>Next up, we need a directory to hold our Terraform configuration and state. Create a new folder in <code>waypoint-demo</code> called <code>infrastructure</code> and add a file called <code>versions.tf</code>.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo
$ <span>mkdir</span> infrastructure
$ <span>cd</span> infrastructure
$ <span>touch</span> versions.tf</code></pre></div>
<p>Great, we now have a place to land both our Waypoint and Terraform configuration.</p>
<h3>Creating our infrastructure with Terraform</h3>
<p>We are going to use Terraform to define the infrastructure for our application. In the context of this blog post, that means our AWS resources that our Next.js application is going to run on. For this post, we are going to use AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) to run our application.</p>
<p>To do that we first need to provision a new ECS cluster in our AWS account. So we are going to add the following to our <code>versions.tf</code> file inside of our <code>infrastructure</code> folder.</p>
<div data-language="hcl"><pre><code>terraform {
  required_version = "&gt;= 0.13"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "nextjs-cluster" {
  name = "waypoint-nextjs-cluster"
}</code></pre></div>
<p>This will use the AWS provider in Terraform to provision a new ECS cluster in our account with the name <code>waypoint-nextjs-cluster</code>. Let’s go ahead and run <code>terraform apply</code> to provision our cluster.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo/infrastructure
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  
  + resource <span>"aws_ecs_cluster"</span> <span>"nextjs-cluster"</span> <span>{</span>
      + arn  <span>=</span> <span>(</span>known after apply<span>)</span>

          + value <span>=</span> <span>(</span>known after apply<span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only <span>'yes'</span> will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: <span>yes</span>

<p>💪 We now have our AWS ECS cluster that we are going to run our application in. Next up we need a container image registry for Waypoint to publish to. We can use AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for that.</p>
<p>We can add an ECR resource to our Terraform configuration in <code>versions.tf</code>. Add the following resource to the bottom of that file.</p>
<div data-language="hcl"><pre><code>resource "aws_ecr_repository" "nextjs-image-repo" {
  name = "nextjs-image"
}</code></pre></div>
<p>We can run <code>terraform apply</code> one more time to create our image repository.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ terraform apply

<h3>Using Waypoint to deploy our application</h3>
<p>Now that we have the AWS resources we need to run our Next.js app, let’s deploy it using Waypoint!</p>
<p>To leverage <code>waypoint</code> we need to add our configuration to <code>waypoint.hcl</code>. We are going to focus on building our Next.js app as a container image and deploying it to our running ECS cluster.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and add the following to our <code>waypoint.hcl</code> file.</p>
<div data-language="hcl"><pre><code>project = "example-next-ecs"

app "next-ecs" {
  build {
    use "pack" {}
    # Use ECR docker registry provisioned via infrastructure/versions.tf
    registry {
      use "aws-ecr" {
        region     = "us-west-2"
        repository = "nextjs-image"
        tag        = "latest"
      }
    }

  }

  # Deploy to ECS
  deploy {
    use "aws-ecs" {
      cluster = "waypoint-nextjs-cluster"
      region  = "us-west-2"
      memory  = "512"
    }
  }
}</code></pre></div>
<p>What in the world are we doing here?</p>
<p>First, we define an <code>app</code> for Waypoint, <code>next-ecs</code>. Inside of our app, we then define a build step and a deploy step. With our <code>build</code> step we are making use of <a href="https://buildpacks.io/">Cloud Native Buildpacks</a> plugin via the <code>use "pack" {}</code> block. This is in favor of using Docker, but Docker is supported inside of Waypoint as well. We then define our <code>registry</code> block. This is used by the <code>build</code> step in Waypoint to push the built container image to a remote repository. This remote repository is the ECR repository we provisioned via Terraform.</p>
<p>Inside of the <code>deploy</code> block we make use of the <code>aws-ecs</code> plugin for Waypoint. Here we specify the ECS cluster we want to deploy our container to. Again, this is the cluster we provisioned earlier via Terraform. We also specify the <code>memory</code> we want our container to have, <code>512 MB</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we understand what is going on, let’s deploy it. We first need to initialize Waypoint and then we can run the <code>up</code> command.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>cd</span> waypoint-demo
$ waypoint init
$ waypoint up

<p>The team only has to answer 2 questions in Sprint Planning, but they’re big ones:</p>



<ol><li>What can we do in this sprint?</li><li>How are we going to do it?</li></ol>



<p>Only the Development Team can answer those 2 questions<strong>.</strong> Nobody else can tell them how much work they can do, or how they should do it. Therefore, <strong>the Development Team <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/08/becoming-a-leader-the-hard-and-only-way/">leads</a> sprint planning</strong></p>



<p>First the whole team works together to <strong>create the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/07/scrums-sprint-goal-vs-mishmash-sprints/">Sprint Goal</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Then, the Development Team <strong>moves tickets one by one</strong> from the top of the prioritized <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/03/backlogs-are-not-idea-buckets/">Product Backlog</a> into the Sprint Backlog. They stop when they feel like the Sprint is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">full enough</a>.</p>



<p>After that, the Development Team <strong>self organizes around the work</strong> and <strong>creates <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">a plan for the sprint</a></strong>. This is where they discuss parallel vs. sequential work, or decompose tickets that are too big, etc.</p>



<p>Voila! That’s a planned Sprint! </p>



<p><em>For more information, see the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#events-planning">Scrum Guide section on Sprint Planning</a>.</em></p>



<h3 id="Antipatterns:">Anti-patterns:</h3>



<ol><li><em>Sprint Planning shouldn’t be led by anyone besides the Development Team. </em>Not the Scrum Master, not the Product Owner, not the PM. It’s harder for the Development Team to take ownership of their work if they aren’t leading the discussion.</li><li><em>Sprint Planning shouldn’t gather a collection of unrelated tickets for the Sprint</em>. As much as possible, tickets should all relate to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/07/scrums-sprint-goal-vs-mishmash-sprints/">the single Sprint Goal</a> so that people can work together towards a single iteration.</li><li><em>Sprints should never be pre-planned before Sprint Planning starts</em>. The Sprint Backlog should be empty when Sprint Planning starts, so there’s no hidden pressure to commit to a pre-planned sprint. I’m talking to you, Product Owner who puts tickets into “sprint buckets” before Sprint Planning.</li></ol>

You need to set up a website, but your product partner is already behind on features so that leaves it solely up to you. What's your plan?

You can graduate to something a little more custom once you have more resources and your brand, positioning, and voice figured out.</span></span></span></span></p><p data-slate-object="block" data-key="8903"><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="8904"><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-offset-key="8904:0"><span><span data-slate-string="true">Sounds like a good plan, but anyone who's gone down this path knows it's never as simple as it seems.</span></span></span></span></p><p data-slate-object="block" data-key="8907"><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="8908"><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-offset-key="8908:0"><span><span data-slate-string="true">For one, the template never lasts as long as you need it to. You realize the design isn't working, or your competitor just unexpectedly made a move. So you start trying to make changes. Swapping out the text and images comes easy, but as soon as you start adjusting the layout, frustration begins to set in. You've got a million other things to do and for some reason you can't get the page to look right on mobile. </span></span></span></span></p><p data-slate-object="block" data-key="8911"><span data-slate-object="text" data-key="8912"><span data-slate-leaf="true" data-offset-key="8912:0"><span><span data-slate-string="true">As it turns out, the same features and guard rails that made it easy to stand up the template have now become the reason it's hard to iterate.

Despite its many shortcomings around bulk management, a surprising number of customers were willing to put in extra manual work to build and maintain full websites. The reason? Our user experience was actually designed for them—intelligent and tech-savvy generalists who wanted to break free from the template without having to go get a degree.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>In this post I want to discuss an issue that I, being for a longer time in IT meanwhile, observe over and over again. It is the observation that as an industry we continuously forget what we have learned.</p>
<p>What do I mean with that claim?</p>
<h2 id="the-very-first-discussion----again-and-again-and-">The very first discussion – again and again and …</h2>
<p>Probably I best illustrate this by sharing an experience I had. About two years ago I attended an unconference. It was not the first time I attended it. I liked it a lot. It always had a very energetic atmosphere. The participants were very active, loved to share and discuss. But unlike the previous times, I decided to do something different that year.</p>
<p>As an experiment, I decided not to share myself, not to offer sessions myself where I drive the topic of discussion, but to listen only. I know that this is not the idea of an unconference, but I was curious. As I wrote: It was a little experiment, I wanted to conduct.</p>
<p>I knew that always a very active group of people gathered at this unconference and I wanted to use that as an unbiased opportunity to learn about the state of IT, how people think about topics, what moves them, and so on. So, I looked forward to what I would learn.</p>
<p>To be frank, it was a devastating experience for me.</p>
<p>The session that really killed it was a session about <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_1/">reusability</a>. A group of people came together to discuss reusability. I was really curious as I dealt with the topic for many years already. A great community. A topic I am particularly interested in. I was looking forward to learning something new. I did not expect a lot of new ideas, but maybe one or two.</p>
<p>So, I listened … and could not believe what I heard.</p>
<p>The discussion moved at a level as if nobody ever had said or written a single word about reusability in the past 50 years. I felt set back to a pre-1968 discussion, set back to a time before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_Software_Engineering_Conferences">NATO Software Engineering Conferences</a> were held. Where had all the ideas about reusability from the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s and all the years after gone?</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody in the room ever had heard anything about what we as an industry already had figured out about reusability. They discussed the topic completely from scratch, and due to that in a totally naive way, not touching any of the important learning of the last 50 years. I sat there listening and did not understand what happened. I felt the urge to jump up and scream: “Shut up, all of you! You do not know sh*t about reusability!”</p>
<p>Of course, I did not. Besides the fact that it would have been very rude, it also would have been unfair.</p>
<p>As I wrote before: It was a very active community that gathered there, all of them adding with their best intentions to a vibrant discussion. So, I eventually decided to leave. Not all sessions felt as devastating as this one but I had similar experiences in most of the sessions I attended.</p>
<p>I was quite confused and had a lot to ponder. I went to the conference to learn something new and … well, I learned something new. But it was definitely not what I expected to learn. I learned that the people in the sessions I attended did not seem to have any knowledge about the discussions that we had before in our industry about the very topics.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-collective-amnesia">Continuous collective amnesia</h2>
<p>What happened? It kept me a while thinking. Eventually, I realized that I had observed a disease of our whole industry in its purest form: We continuously forget what we have learned. We always reinvent everything from scratch. My personal observation is that discussions in the IT community start over about every 5 years <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. That is how long we remember as a community. After that we need to rediscover your insights from scratch.</p>
<p>Or how I like to phrase it in a bit provocative way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In IT, we suffer from continuous collective amnesia and we are even proud of it! <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this is not about the people who discussed in that room. All of them did their best, they eagerly discussed hoping to gather new insights. They were simply victims of a widespread disease in IT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not value the wisdom of the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We suffer from extreme youth obsession, not only regarding the age of people but also regarding how we value knowledge. Old knowledge is considered “worthless”, while new knowledge is considered “great”.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/BitmenStudios/status/1263070511812227072">tweet</a> that Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios sent me in a little conversion we had via Twitter IMO really nicely describes the effect:</p>
<p><img src="https://ufried.com/blog/continuous_amnesia_issue/continuous_amnesia.png" alt="Tweet from Mark, founder of Bitmen Studios: My point here is rather not searching for a unique “best” solution but everywhere software devs across the globe are solving the “same” problem again and again (and fall into the same pitfalls). The increase in tech needed and the associated complexity amplifies that problem." title="We solve the same problems again and again"></p>
<p>We reinvent the wheel over and over again, making the same mistakes again and again, not learning as a community. And as Mark correctly pointed out, the growing technology complexity amplifies the problem – and, as I would like to add, vice versa: Our continuous collective amnesia amplifies our <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/">growing complexity problem</a>.</p>
<p>Why is it this way? Why do we loose our collective memory every 5 years?</p>
<p>I am not sure about the causes. My current attempt of an explanation consists of 5 factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>We consider ourselves a dynamic, fast moving industry. New concepts, tools and technologies emerge every day. How can knowledge of yesterday still be applicable to problems of today? That is what we keep telling ourselves. We wallow in our perceived vigor and speed of innovation, neglecting that we keep solving the same problems over and over again, just with different tools and technologies. Yes, some things change, but usually 80%+ of the problems stay the same. But we refuse to see that. We prefer considering ourselves the “masters of new”.</li>
<li>We are technology believers. We are convinced that we can solve any problem by simply applying the right tool or technology. E.g., if people have a collaboration problem, the typical reflex is to look for a tool that solves the problem, neglecting that it almost certainly is not a tool problem. The same is true for all other kinds of problems. Whenever we face a non-trivial problem, we try to solve it by applying a tool or technology to it instead of solving the actual problem. This has become such a natural pattern that we do not realize it anymore. And as past tools and technologies did not solve the problem, we look for new ones.</li>
<li>Insights grow slower than knowledge. Our knowledge continuously grows, the longer we work in IT. Of course, not everything we learn is valuable. Quite often we learn that some of our knowledge is plain crap. If I, e.g., think back to SOA: Wow, what a crap! Would never do it again this way! But not everything was bad. I also took some great insights from the SOA times. It takes times to separate the wheat from the chaff. In the beginning of our careers we basically learn new stuff all the time. It takes some years until we start to see the recurring patterns, to separate real insights from plain knowledge.</li>
<li>We face a continuous stream of new developers. I feel as if I face a new generation of developers every 5 years <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Maybe that is a very subjective experience. But for me, people just coming from their IT education, being 5 years in business, 10 years or 15 years and more feel very different, like different generations. All those new people in IT have to build their own insights from scratch. They have nothing to build on as in IT we created a cult(ure) of new, celebrating the new and despising the old.</li>
<li>If you combine the “cult of new” with what I call “the arrogance of the youth”, you get an explosive mixture. Before you think that I want to talk bad about younger people: I just talk from personal experience. I was a graduate myself years ago and believe me: I was arrogant! I knew better! I had to learn humbleness the hard way, and I am still not sure if I arrived (it is a lot easier to judge an old self than to judge the current self). So, I do not want to reproach any young person for being somewhat arrogant. I guess that is natural and also healthy to a certain degree because it helps against persisting in outdated ideas as an industry. But in a culture of new, this habit works as an unhealthy accelerant.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we put these factors together, we end up with an environment where we only value new things and despise old things. If we face a problem, we never look if someone solved the same problem before <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. We only look for a shiny new solution, ideally a new tool or technology. If we learn a good solution for a problem, we forget it after a few years and start again from scratch.</p>
<p>It is not that individuals do not learn and do not grow insights. They do.</p>
<p>But as a community, we do not.</p>
<p>Unlike other engineering disciplines, we do not create our body of knowledge, foster our timeless insights, work to extract the essence from the solutions we found yesterday and make it available to the community of today. We do not only not create a body of knowledge, we despise it. We always look to the horizon hoping to spot a silver bullet (which does not exist as we know) instead of looking back once in a while and trying to learn from the wisdom of our ancestors.</p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>This is what I observe all the time. Again, this does not mean that I do not meet individuals who act differently. But in general, I see the same discussions recurring again and again about every 5 years.</p>
<p>To be honest, I do not have an actual idea how to change this. This cult of new is so deeply embedded in our culture and self-perception that it would take a long time and effort to change it.</p>
<p>Personally, I try to share some of the old wisdom, e.g., with my talk <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ufried/excavating-the-knowledge-of-our-ancestors">“Excavating the knowledge of the ancestors”</a>. There is also the <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">“Papers We Love”</a> movement that tries to share such knowledge.</p>
<p>But overall this is just a drop in the ocean. It would require a radical rethinking to stop our continuous collective amnesia. We would need to accept that most of our problems are not new, but that most of the times we solve the same problems again and again, just with different technology.</p>
<p>But until we learn this, I am afraid we are not yet an engineering discipline, but rather a bunch of people obsessed with “new”, not learning.</p>
<p>As so often, there would be a lot more to write. But I leave it here. I hope I gave you something to …</p></div></div>

The basic configuration block is IAM policies, which contain statements that grant/deny permissions.</p> <p>The first step IAM does is it <strong>constructs a request context</strong> which contains all the details, such as who is making the request (the Principal), what is the action (Action), and on which resource (Resource), along with a bunch of others metadata, such as the IP address, whether the identity is authenticated with MFA, and several other things. The exact parameters are unfortunately not visible, and the only available resource is the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html#context_keys_table">reference documentation</a>. This makes it more of a trial-and-error to get some insight into the values for a request.</p> <p>Thinking of requests as lists of name-value pairs helps understanding how policy statements match them.</p> <p>In the next step, IAM <strong>collects all the statements that match the request context</strong>. Each statement has a set of <strong>filters</strong>, in the form of the <code>Action</code>, <code>Principal</code>, <code>Resource</code>, and <code>Condition</code> properties. The statements that match the request context will be included in the <em>policy evaluation logic</em>.</p> <p>Whether the request is allowed or denied depends on the <em>type</em> of matching statements and their <code>Effect</code>s. The two most important policy types are resource- and identity-based policies, as all the others (SCP, permissions boundary, session policy) are for specific use-cases and they are <em>optional</em> in the evaluation flow.</p> <p>The decision for most resources follow this process:</p> <p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" preserveAspectRatio="" style="width:466px;height:514px" viewBox="0 0

Access Control, or ABAC for short) can use tags defined for the principal. This makes a highly scalable permission scheme, as adding and removing tags from resources and identities grants and removes the permissions instead of having to modify the policies attached to them.</p> <p>Let’s see an example where the user has an <code>access=restricted</code> tag attached, and a policy that allows reading objects with the same tag!</p> <p><svg

It’s easy to see how it doesn’t when the two values are different.</p> <h2 id="restricted-resources">Restricted resources</h2> <p>In the S3 bucket example, either the identity- or the resource-based policy is enough to give access. This is the case for most resource types, but there are exceptions. An <strong>IAM role’s trust policy</strong> needs to allow the action explicitly, it’s not enough that the identity policy allows it.</p> <p>The resource policy can allow in two ways. It can allow the user explicitly, such as <code>"Principal": "&lt;iam&gt;/user"</code>. In this case, the operation is allowed and there is no need for an identity policy. This is how it works for less strict resources.</p> <p>The other way is to allow <em>the account</em> in the form of <code>"Principal": "arn:aws:iam::&lt;accountid&gt;:root"</code>. This delegates access control to the identity policies to decide. If a trust policy does not allow either the requesting identity or the account then the request is denied.</p> <p>This is how the policy evaluation flow looks like for these resources:</p> <p><svg

<p>In this book we will work through the motivation and technical details behind <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow">differential dataflow</a>, a computational framework build on top of <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/timely-dataflow">timely dataflow</a> intended for efficiently performing computations on large amounts of data and <em>maintaining</em> the computations as the data change.</p>
<p>Differential dataflow programs look like many standard "big data" computations, borrowing idioms from frameworks like MapReduce and SQL. However, once you write and run your program, you can <em>change</em> the data inputs to the computation, and differential dataflow will promptly show you the corresponding changes in its output. Promptly meaning in as little as milliseconds.</p>
<p>This relatively simple set-up, write programs and then change inputs, leads to a surprising breadth of exciting and new classes of scalable computation. We will explore it in this document!</p>
<hr>
<p>Differential dataflow arose from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/naiad_sosp2013.pdf">work at Microsoft Research</a>, where we aimed to build a high-level framework that could both compute and incrementally maintain non-trivial algorithms.</p>

<p>Any database schema is likely to have plenty of text fields. In this article, I divide text fields into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Small texts</strong>: names, slugs, usernames, emails, etc. These are text fields that usually have some low size limit, maybe even using <code>varchar(n)</code> and not <code>text</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large texts</strong>: blog post content, articles, HTML content etc. These are large pieces of free, unrestricted text that is stored in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium texts</strong>: descriptions, comments, product reviews, stack traces etc. These are any text field that is between the small and the large. These type of texts would normally be unrestricted, but naturally smaller than the large texts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In this article I demonstrate the surprising impact of medium-size texts on query performance in PostgreSQL.</strong></p>

<h2 id="understanding-toast"><a href="#understanding-toast">Understanding TOAST</a></h2>
<p>When talking about large chunks of text, or any other field that may contain large amounts of data, we first need to understand how the database handles the data. Intuitively, you might think that the database is storing large pieces of data inline like it does smaller pieces of data, but in fact, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html" rel="noopener">it does not</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL uses a fixed page size (commonly 8 kB), and does not allow tuples to span multiple pages. Therefore, it is not possible to store very large field values directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the documentation explains, PostgreSQL can't store rows (tuples) in multiple pages. So how does the database store large chunks of data?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] large field values are compressed and/or broken up into multiple physical rows. [...] The technique is affectionately known as TOAST (or “the best thing since sliced bread”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, so how is this TOAST working exactly?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any of the columns of a table are TOAST-able, the table will have an associated TOAST table</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So TOAST is a separate table associated with our table. It is used to store large pieces of data of TOAST-able columns (the <code>text</code> datatype for example, is TOAST-able).</p>
<p>What constitutes a large value?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TOAST management code is triggered only when a row value to be stored in a table is wider than TOAST_TUPLE_THRESHOLD bytes (normally 2 kB). The TOAST code will compress and/or move field values out-of-line until the row value is shorter than TOAST_TUPLE_TARGET bytes (also normally 2 kB, adjustable) or no more gains can be had</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL will try to compress a the large values in the row, and if the row can't fit within the limit, the values will be stored out-of-line in the TOAST table.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-toast"><a href="#finding-the-toast">Finding the TOAST</a></h3>
<p>Now that we have <em>some</em> understanding of what TOAST is, let's see it in action. First, create a table with a text field:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>id</span> <span>SERIAL</span><span>,</span> <span>value</span> <span>TEXT</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table contains an id column, and a value field of type <code>TEXT</code>. Notice that we did not change any of the default storage parameters.</p>
<p>The text field we added supports TOAST, or is TOAST-able, so PostgreSQL should create a TOAST table. Let's try to locate the TOAST table associated with the table <code>toast_test</code> in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-class.html" rel="noopener"><code>pg_class</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span><span>,</span> <span>reltoastrelid</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>relname</span> <span>=</span> <span>'toast_test'</span><span>;</span>
<span>  relname   │ reltoastrelid</span>
<span>────────────┼───────────────</span>
<span> toast_test │        340488</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>relname</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_class</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>oid</span> <span>=</span> <span>340488</span><span>;</span>
<span>     relname</span>
<span>─────────────────</span>
<span> pg_toast_340484</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As promised, PostgreSQL created a TOAST table called <code>pg_toast_340484</code>.</p>
<h3 id="toast-in-action"><a href="#toast-in-action">TOAST in Action</a></h3>
<p>Let's see what the TOAST table looks like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\d</span> <span>pg_toast.pg_toast_340484</span>
<span>TOAST table "pg_toast.pg_toast_340484"</span>
<span>   Column   │  Type</span>
<span>────────────┼─────────</span>
<span> chunk_id   │ oid</span>
<span> chunk_seq  │ integer</span>
<span> chunk_data │ bytea</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The TOAST table contains three columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chunk_id</code>: A reference to a toasted value.</li>
<li><code>chunk_seq</code>: A sequence within the chunk.</li>
<li><code>chunk_data</code>: The actual chunk data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to "regular" tables, the TOAST table also has the same restrictions on inline values. To overcome this restriction, large values are split into chunks that can fit within the limit.</p>
<p>At this point the table is empty:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This makes sense because we did not insert any data yet. So next, insert a small value into the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'small value'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>
<span> chunk_id │ chunk_seq │ chunk_data</span>
<span>──────────┼───────────┼────────────</span>
<span>(0 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After inserting the small value into the table, the TOAST table remained empty. This means the small value was small enough to be stored inline, and there was no need to move it out-of-line to the TOAST table.</p>

<p>Let's insert a large value and see what happens:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'n0cfPGZOCwzbHSMRaX8 ... WVIlRkylYishNyXf'</span><span>);</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I shortened the value for brevity, but that's a random string with 4096 characters. Let's see what the TOAST table stores now:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span><span>;</span>

<span>   995899 │         2 │ \x6c78426358574534...</span>
<span>(3 rows)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The large value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table. Because the value was too large to fit inline in a single row, PostgreSQL split it into three chunks. The <code>\x3063...</code> notation is how psql displays binary data.</p>

<p>Finally, execute the following query to summarize the data in the TOAST table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>

<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>   995899 │      3 │ 4096 bytes</span>
<span>(1 row)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As we've already seen, the text is stored in three chunks.</p>
<div>
<p>size of database objects</p>
<p>There are several ways to get the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-DBSIZE" rel="noopener">size of database objects in PostgreSQL</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pg_table_size</code>: Get the size of the table including TOAST, but excluding indexes</li>
<li><code>pg_relation_size</code>: Get the size of just the table</li>
<li><code>pg_total_relation_size</code>: Get the size of the table, including indexes and TOAST</li>
</ul>
<p>Another useful function is <code>pg_size_pretty</code>: used to display sizes in a friendly format.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="toast-compression"><a href="#toast-compression">TOAST Compression</a></h3>
<p>So far I refrained from categorizing texts by their size. The reason for that is that the size of the text itself does not matter, what matters is its size after compression.</p>
<p>To create long strings for testing, we'll implement a function to generate random strings at a given length:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span>

<p>Generate a string made out of 10 random characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>);</span>
<span> generate_random_string</span>
<span>────────────────────────</span>
<span> o0QsrMYRvp</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We can also provide a set of characters to generate the random string from. For example, generate a string made of 10 random digits:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'1234567890'</span><span>);</span>
<span> generate_random_string</span>
<span>────────────────────────</span>
<span> 4519991669</span>
</pre></div>


<p>PostgreSQL TOAST uses the <a href="https://doxygen.postgresql.org/pg__lzcompress_8c_source.html" rel="noopener">LZ family of compression</a> techniques. Compression algorithms usually work by identifying and eliminating repetition in the value. A long string containing fewer characters should compress very well compared to a string made of many different characters when encoded into bytes.</p>
<p>To illustrate how TOAST uses compression, we'll clean out the <code>toast_test</code> table, and insert a random string made of many possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>TRUNCATE</span> <span>toast_test</span><span>;</span>
<span>TRUNCATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10kb value made of random characters. Let's check the TOAST table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The value is stored out-of-line in the TOAST table, and we can see it is not compressed.</p>
<p>Next, insert a value with a similar length, but made out of fewer possible characters:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'123'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We inserted a 10K value, but this time it only contained 3 possible digits: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code>. This text is more likely to contain repeating binary patterns, and should compress better than the previous value. Looking at the TOAST, we can see PostgreSQL compressed the value to ~3kB, which is a third of the size of the uncompressed value. Not a bad compression rate!</p>
<p>Finally, insert a 10K long string made of a single digit:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>toast_test</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>values</span> <span>(</span><span>generate_random_string</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>'0'</span><span>));</span>
<span>INSERT 0 1</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>chunk_id</span><span>,</span> <span>COUNT</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>chunks</span><span>,</span> <span>pg_size_pretty</span><span>(</span><span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>octet_length</span><span>(</span><span>chunk_data</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>bigint</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span> <span>pg_toast</span><span>.</span><span>pg_toast_340484</span> <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span> chunk_id │ chunks │ pg_size_pretty</span>
<span>──────────┼────────┼────────────────</span>
<span>  1495960 │      6 │ 10 kB</span>
<span>  1495961 │      2 │ 3067 bytes</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The string was compressed so well, that the database was able to store it in-line.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><b>Binary lambda calculus</b> (<b>BLC</b>) is a minimal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional" title="Purely functional">pure</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_language" title="Functional programming language">functional programming language</a> invented by John Tromp in 2004,<sup id="cite_ref-RAC_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-RAC-1">[1]</a></sup> based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_encoding" title="Binary encoding">binary encoding</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untyped_lambda_calculus" title="Untyped lambda calculus">untyped lambda calculus</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index" title="De Bruijn index">De Bruijn index</a> notation.</p>



<h2><span id="Background">Background</span></h2>
<p>BLC is designed to provide a very simple and elegant concrete definition of descriptional complexity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity" title="Kolmogorov complexity">Kolmogorov complexity</a>).</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, the complexity of an object is the length of its shortest description.</p>
<p>To make this precise, we take descriptions to be bitstrings, and identify a description method with some computational device, or machine, that transforms descriptions into objects. Objects are usually also just bitstrings, but can have additional structure as well, e.g., pairs of strings.</p>
<p>Originally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" title="Turing machine">Turing machines</a>, the most well known formalism for computation, were used for this purpose. But they are somewhat lacking in ease of construction and composability. Another classical computational formalism, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" title="Lambda calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, offers distinct advantages in ease of use. The lambda calculus doesn't incorporate any notion of I/O though, so one needs to be designed.</p>
<h2><span id="Binary_I.2FO">Binary I/O</span></h2>
<p>Adding a readbit primitive function to lambda calculus, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin" title="Chaitin">Chaitin</a> did for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISP" title="LISP">LISP</a>, would destroy its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)" title="Referential transparency (computer science)">referential transparency</a>, unless one distinguishes between an I/O action and its result, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)" title="Haskell (programming language)">Haskell</a> does with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)" title="Monad (functional programming)">monadic</a> I/O. But that requires a type system, an unnecessary complication.</p>
<p>Instead, BLC requires translating bitstrings into lambda terms, to which the machine (itself a lambda term) can be readily applied.</p>
<p>Bits 0 and 1 are translated into the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Logic_and_predicates" title="Lambda calculus">lambda booleans</a> <i>B</i><sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= True and <i>B</i><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;= False:</p>

<p>The <i>z</i> works as a list continuation, that could be a nil list (to end the string) or another string (that would be appended to the original string).</p>
<h2><span id="Delimited_versus_undelimited">Delimited versus undelimited</span></h2>
<p>Descriptional complexity actually comes in two distinct flavors, depending on whether the input is considered to be delimited.</p>
<p>Knowing the end of your input makes it easier to describe objects. For instance, you can just copy the whole input to output. This flavor is called <i>plain</i> or <i>simple</i> complexity.</p>
<p>But in a sense it is additional information. A file system for instance needs to separately store the length of files. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (programming language)">C language</a> uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character" title="Null character">null character</a> to denote the end of a string, but this comes at the cost of not having that character available within strings.</p>
<p>The other flavor is called <i>prefix</i> complexity, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code" title="Prefix code">prefix codes</a>, where the machine needs to figure out, from the input read so far, whether it needs to read more bits. We say that the input is self-delimiting. This works better for communication channels, since one can send multiple descriptions, one after the other, and still tell them apart.</p>
<p>In the I/O model of BLC, the flavor is dictated by the choice of <i>z</i>. If we keep it as a free variable, and demand that it appears as part of the output, then the machine must be working in a self-delimiting manner. If on the other hand we use a lambda term specifically designed to be easy to distinguish from any pairing, then the input becomes delimited. BLC chooses <i>False</i> for this purpose but gives it the more descriptive alternative name of <i>Nil</i>. Dealing with lists that may be Nil is straightforward: since</p>

</dl>
<p>one can write functions <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> to deal with the two cases, the only caveat being that <i>N</i> will be passed to <i>M</i> as its third argument.</p>
<h2><span id="Universality">Universality</span></h2>
<p>We can find a description method <i>U</i> such that for any other description method <i>D</i>, there is a constant <i>c</i> (depending only on <i>D</i>) such that no object takes more than <i>c</i> extra bits to describe with method <i>U</i> than with method <i>D</i>. And BLC is designed to make these constants relatively small. In fact the constant will be the length of a binary encoding of a <i>D</i>-interpreter written in BLC, and <i>U</i> will be a lambda term that parses this encoding and runs this decoded interpreter on the rest of the input. <i>U</i> won't even have to know whether the description is delimited or not; it works the same either way.</p>
<p>Having already solved the problem of translating bitstrings into lambda calculus, we now face the opposite problem: how to encode lambda terms into bitstrings?</p>
<h2><span id="Lambda_encoding">Lambda encoding</span></h2>
<p>First we need to write our lambda terms in a particular notation using what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_indices" title="De Bruijn indices">De Bruijn indices</a>. Our encoding is then defined recursively as follows</p>

<p>A <b>closed</b> lambda term is one in which all variables are bound, i.e. without any free variables. In De Bruijn format, this means that an index <i>i</i> can only appear within at least <i>i</i> nested lambdas. The number of closed terms of size <i>n</i> bits is given by sequence <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences" title="OEIS"><img alt="OEIS" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/OEISicon_light.svg/11px-OEISicon_light.svg.png" width="11" height="15" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/OEISicon_light.svg/17px-OEISicon_light.svg.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/OEISicon_light.svg/22px-OEISicon_light.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="409" data-file-height="556"></a>â€Š<a href="https://oeis.org/A114852" title="oeis:A114852">A114852</a></span> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences" title="On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.</p>

That beats both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip" title="Gzip">gzip</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2" title="Bzip2">bzip2</a>, compressors that need 344 and 352 bits respectively, to describe the same output (as an 8192 byte file with a single letter name).</p>
<h2><span id="Halting_probability">Halting probability</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_probability" title="Halting probability">halting probability</a> of the prefix universal machine is defined as the probability it will output any term that has a closed normal form (this includes all translated strings):</p>

</dl>
<p>With some effort, we can determine the first 4 bits of this particular number of wisdom:</p>

<dd><span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d57520587781f96f451a2f64ff44fe17cc53f89d" aria-hidden="true" alt="\Omega _{\lambda }=.0001\ldots _{2}"></span></dd>
</dl>
<p>where probability <span>.0001<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= 2<sup>âˆ’4</sup></span> is already contributed by programs <span>00100</span> and <span>00101</span> for terms True and False.</p>
<h2><span id="BLC8:_byte_sized_I.2FO">BLC8: byte sized I/O</span></h2>
<p>While bit streams are nice in theory, they fare poorly in interfacing with the real world. The language BLC8 is a more practical variation on BLC in which programs operate on a stream of bytes, where each byte is represented as a delimited list of 8 bits in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-endian" title="Big-endian">big-endian</a> order.</p>
<p>BLC8 requires a more complicated universal machine:</p>
<p><span><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9e0110e0a62772b331f4f99383a900e1a77fdad9" aria-hidden="true" alt="{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}U8=\,&amp;\lambda 1((\lambda 11)(\lambda (\lambda \lambda \lambda 1(\lambda \lambda \lambda 2(\lambda \lambda \lambda (\lambda 7(10(\lambda 5(2(\lambda \lambda 3(\lambda 123)))(11(\lambda 3(\lambda 31(21)))))3)\\&amp;(4(1(\lambda 15)3)(10(\lambda 2(\lambda 2(16)))6)))8)(\lambda 1(\lambda 87(\lambda 162))))(\lambda 1(43)))(11))(\lambda \lambda 2((\lambda 11)(\lambda 11))))\end{aligned}}}"></span></p>
<p>The parser in U8 keeps track of both remaining bytes, and remaining bits in the current byte, discarding the latter when parsing is completed. Thus the size of U8, which is 355 bits as a BLC program, is 45 bytes in BLC8.</p>

The formatting obscures the occurrence of double digit indices: a 10 on line 1, a 15 on line 2, and an 11 and three 12s on line 3. These indices are marked with underlines to distinguish them from single digit indices.</p>
<p>This provides a nice example of the property that universal description methods differ by at most a constant in complexity. Writing a BLC8 interpreter in Brainfuck, which would provide a matching upper bound in the other direction, is left as an exercise for die-hard Brainfuck programmers.</p>
<p>The interpreter expects its input to consist of a Brainfuck program followed by a <code>]</code> followed by the input for the Brainfuck program. The interpreter only looks at bits 0,1,4 of each …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/procrastination_work_no.png" alt="Q2 Time: how to work without a looming deadline"></p><p>You have work to do, but the deadline is in a couple of weeks or months. Or you have no deadline at all.</p><p>How do you do great work every day instead of the usual last-minute push before a deadline?<br>A vitally important question in the era of knowledge work.</p><h3>The mythical land of Q2, the important but not urgent</h3><p>This post is all about the Q2 of the Eisenhower matrix - the part that many procrastinators never get around to.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/eisenhower_Q2.png" alt="Eisenhower Matrix"></p><p>It's a shame because Q2 is where all the future-focused, strategic work lies: learning new skills, investing into new endeavors, working on new branches of a business,...</p><p><strong>Q2 is the quadrant of potential.</strong></p><p>Without spending time in Q2 frequently, we tread water in life, doing only the things that we've always done, or that we're forced into at the last minute. Just enough to get by, but not to go to bed with a sense of pride.</p><p>Let's change this.</p><p>We'll start with the first obstacle to working on non-urgent important tasks—the reactive habit of&nbsp;<em>checking</em>.</p><h2>Why checking things became a default habit</h2><p>If you have Internet access, you probably developed this simple habit:</p><p><em>When I get bored, I check ___________.</em></p><p>This is a problem.</p><p>Work often isn't engaging at the beginning of a session. It can seem onerous, never-ending, and boring (before you get into the problem-solving mode).</p><p>If you always have an easy way to get distracted, you'll take it. Often.</p><p>When you&nbsp;<em>check</em>&nbsp;a site or app, you get a bit of dopamine - a feel-good neurochemical.</p><p>This dopamine hit makes it addictive to check stuff. Just the possibility of something new, random, or unexpected is exciting, even if that new thing ends up being a work email.</p><p>Checking things is the cornerstone of&nbsp;<strong>a reactive work style:</strong></p><ul><li>You never do something unless it's in reply to someone else.</li><li>You wait for others to remind you multiple times to do something.</li><li>You refresh inboxes constantly and keep them open at all times.</li><li>When you find yourself bored, you immediately check something.</li></ul><p><strong>This way of working is devoid of initiative. It's an addiction to new information disguised as being "responsive."</strong></p><p>Nothing non-urgent ever gets done.</p><p>How can we get ourselves to do it?</p><h2>2 ways to do non-urgent work</h2><p>The first way is to make Q2 feel like Q1 - to make it urgent. There's a variety of ways to do it.</p><p>The second way is to choose to work on Q2 because you can.</p><h2>1. Make Q2 feel like Q1</h2><p>When we're on a deadline, we spring into action.</p><p>The consequences of not acting become clear: we'll get fired, fail a class, or ruin a relationship...</p><p>The fear of these scenarios is visceral. It drives us to finally get things done.</p><p>While reliance on this fear is not ideal, we can use it.</p><h3>Create consequences for your actions (or lack thereof)</h3><p>If you know that without a deadline, you don't work, create deadlines.</p><p>There are many ways of doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</strong><br>If you tell a coworker that you'll have done something by Tuesday, they will expect you to deliver. If you don't, you'll cause them to be disappointed or angry. That's a clear consequence.</li><li><strong>Promise publicly you'll do something.</strong><br>If you promise on social media or any other public forum that you'll do something by a certain time, you're putting your reputation at risk.</li><li><strong>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</strong><br>If it's 3PM and you schedule a fancy dinner with your partner at 6PM, it becomes clear that you have only the next 3 hours to get things done (unless you want to miss the dinner). Having more events in your schedule highlights the space available for work. If there's little time for delays, you'll probably adapt and not delay.</li><li><strong>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></strong><br>Both of these services allow you to make a financial bet against yourself. They also help you put your goals into a concrete format. Losing your own money if you don’t do something can be a powerful motivating force.</li></ul><p>Besides these ways of creating a deadline for yourself, you can also heighten your awareness of not working when you're meant to.</p><h3>Create a crystal clear sense of "Now I focus"</h3><p>When a deadline is looming over us, we feel this visceral feeling of "now I really need to work."</p><p>Suddenly, every available hour is an hour we can use to work. Having so much to do and so little time to do it makes us use every minute.</p><p>In other words, it becomes crystal clear to us that&nbsp;<strong>now is the time to focus.</strong></p><p>We can use other tools to get to that feeling.</p><h4>Work alongside others</h4><p>Our environment shapes our behavior in a profound way. Imagine you're working next to a coworker who's focusing intensely. They can also see your screen when they occasionally glance away from their work.</p><p>Would that inspire you to focus a bit more?</p><p>The research says yes.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/497818?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">One study</a>&nbsp;found that the presence of another person improves performance by 16-32%. Interestingly, the study notes: "low productivity workers are the most sensitive to the behavior of peers."</p><p>Now, if you can't use this in your physical environment and work with your coworker, or partner, you can use a service like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></p><p>It allows you to work with 50 minute sessions with others who want to focus on their work.</p><p>You can try the service for free and see if it helps you.</p><h4>Make a grand gesture</h4><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/tips/hotel.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="5 Star hotel"></p><p>A slightly more esoteric way of boosting your awareness of "now I work" is to make a grand gesture.</p><p>Cal Newport describes this strategy in Deep Work and uses the example of J K Rowling.</p><p>When Rowling was stuck writing The Goblet of Fire, she decided to check into a 5 star hotel.</p><p>A stay in a hotel like that is expensive. You can spend hundreds of dollars every day.</p><p>For Rowling, the whole purpose of staying in that hotel was to write. If she was paying thousands of pounds every week, it heightened her awareness time passing. She was paying for every minute, so she'd better produce something worth it.</p><p>Now, this grand gesture is not available to all of us, but another is:&nbsp;<strong>a trip.</strong></p><p>To help himself decide whether to start his online training program AltMBA, Seth Godin went into the desert for a few days with his friends.</p><p>He had one objective for himself: decide.</p><p>He thought about the project, wrote about it, and ultimately decided to commit and do it.</p><p>Could you take a trip somewhere as an opportunity to make a decision you’ve been putting off?</p><p>If you don't want to make yourself work using the above, the other choice is creating a routine in your life to take on non-urgent work without pressure.</p><h2>2. Choosing to work now</h2><h3>Make time for Q2 or it won't happen</h3><p>The anti-dote to reactive site and app checking is&nbsp;<strong>consciously blocking out big uninterrupted chunks of time.</strong></p><p>Our mind works best when we focus on 1 task for an extended period of time, without interruptions.</p><p>If you have email or social media open at all times, you'll get interrupted.</p><h3>Decide to set specific times aside</h3><p>When was the last time you had 2+ hours to work on non-urgent tasks? A time when you didn’t check any distractions and had no one interrupt you?</p><p>If you have to starch your memory extensively to find an answer, then it may be time for a change.</p><p>Uninterrupted time is crucial for productivity, particularly when it comes to dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks.</p><p>It’s also crucial to specify what you’re going to work on. Without a clear intention, the urgent work and unproductive habits will take over.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is to put a big block on the calendar and put what you need to do as the title. You can also add any links or notes to the description.</p><p>When in your week can you do this? When can you make time for futures oriented, important work?</p><h3>Choose to work because you can</h3><p>The last point may well be the most important one. Much of our time, we don’t choose to work. We’re forced to do so by our circumstances. That puts us in a defensive position.</p><p>But we can actively&nbsp;<em>choose</em>&nbsp;to do work. Choose to write that email. Choose to reach out to someone. Choose to start working on the next project. Go on offense.</p><p>Fear is the default motivator for many of us. If I don't do this, I will [insert unpleasant consequences here].</p><p>There are other ways, other internal narratives that we can use.</p><p>"I'm doing this because I have the time and I'm alert and able.""I'll do this because the sooner I do it, the better.""I'll get this done now because it would be awesome if it existed."</p><p>Instead of focusing on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;do something, focus on what happens if you&nbsp;<em>do</em>.</p><p>Switch from the fear of consequences to desire for a specific awesome version of the future.</p><p><strong>When you do block out a 2 hour block of time and find yourself with nothing urgent to do, choose to work.</strong>&nbsp;Because you can. Because you want to create something awesome. Because it will make you happy at the end of the day, week, month, and year.</p><p>Don't wait until circumstances force you, go on offense now!</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>There are 2 main ways to get non-urgent work done:</p><ol start=""><li>Make it feel urgent.</li><li>Choose to do it.</li></ol><p>To make work feel more urgent, you can:</p><ul><li><p>Create consequences for your inaction.</p><ul><li>Tell your coworker you'll do something.</li><li>Promise publicly you'll do something.</li><li>Schedule an event you don't want to miss.</li><li>Sign up for&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stickk.com/">Stickk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.</a></li></ul></li><li><p>Make yourself hyper-aware of not taking action.</p><ul><li>Work alongside others with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.focusmate.com/">Focusmate.</a></li><li>Make not taking action feel wasteful to yourself (scrolling social media in a 5 star hotel).</li></ul></li></ul><p>To choose to do non-urgent work:</p><ul><li>Block out big uninterrupted chunks of time for non-urgent work.</li><li>Assign specific times to specific tasks.</li><li>When you have the opportunity, choose to work because you can.</li></ul><p>Pick 1 strategy out of this article and apply it today!</p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="67c077d4" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>The vision behind Activechat is to make the most advanced AI technology easily available for customer care applications even if your team has zero technical background. This vision empowers our <a href="https://docs.activechat.ai/docs/natural-language-chatbots/">natural-language integrations</a>, <a href="https://activechat.ai/conversational-ai/">sentiment detection</a>, and other advanced features packed into our <a href="https://activechat.ai/chatbots/">visual chatbot builder</a>. But there’s more to it, and we’re happy to introduce our recent integration with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenAI's (opens in a new tab)" href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI’s</a> beta of their GPT-3 model – GPT-3 for live chat.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-3 is a mega machine learning model, created by&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>, and it can write it’s own op-eds, poems, articles, and even working code. As a result of its humongous size (over 175 billion parameters), GPT-3 can do what no other model can do (well): perform&nbsp;<em>specific</em>&nbsp;tasks without any special tuning. You can ask GPT-3 to be a translator, a programmer, a poet, or a famous author, and it can do it with its user (you) providing fewer than 10 training examples.&nbsp;<em>Damn</em>.</p><cite><a href="https://daleonai.com/gpt3-explained-fast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dale Markowitz (opens in a new tab)">Dale Markowitz</a></cite></blockquote><p>Activechat has partnered with OpenAI team to build something that looks like real magic. Once you describe the context of your business in a plain natural language and provide a couple of example questions and answers that your human live chat agents may encounter in their day-to-day conversations with customers, we can use the power of GPT-3 to provide instant hints to your agents to help them answer almost any question that a customer may have.</p><p>Let’s look at some real-life examples of this amazing tech.</p><h2>Bike shop – default settings</h2><p>Imagine that you’re the owner of a bike shop selling hundreds of bikes from various manufacturers. Your website has a lot of traffic and you introduce <a href="https://activechat.ai/live-chat/">live chat</a> to help your customers make their choice and grow your revenue. After a week of accepting incoming chat requests, you suddenly realize that training your agents so that they can really answer this crazy amount of questions from customers-to-be takes tons of time and is quite costly. You have your knowledge base, but most of your agents feel lost when it comes to answering specific questions, and looking for the correct answer often takes quite a lot of time.</p><p>Luckily enough, your live chat solution is powered by Activechat, so you can go to “Settings – Integrations – OpenAI” and describe your business case in plain natural language:</p><blockquote><p>This is a conversation between a website visitor and a smart virtual assistant. The conversations are happening across various pages of the website that is selling bicycles, and virtual assistant can answer all kinds of questions about various bike brands and models and help choose the right one according to description made by the visitor.</p><cite>That’s all you need to seed the OpenAI’s GPT-3 for live chat</cite></blockquote><p>Next, you provide answers to three questions that your customers ask most often:</p><p><strong><em>Q:</em></strong><em> What’s the difference between a carbon and regular bike?<br></em><strong><em>A:</em></strong><em> The primary difference between carbon and aluminum comes down to weight and ride quality.

The more you ride the bike the more frequent you should be servicing it, especially after riding in dirt, sand, mud and in the rain.</em></p><p>Guess what?

Balancing games is difficult, but difficult problems are fun. In this post, I’ll dig into some of the maths behind <a href="https://www.glasstomegames.co.uk/home/the-long-road">The Long Road</a>.</p>

<p>The Long Road (TLR) blends elements of roguelike games and classic text-adventure. You play as a group of scavengers wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland; collecting food, weapons, and more scavengers in a bid to survive. As you explore your world, you are presented with choices that shape the world around you and ultimately determine how long you will last. But, how long <em>should</em> that be?</p>







<p>There is tension in TLR. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uE6-vIi1rQ">A cursed problem</a> arising due to conflicting promises that we make players. We want players to make meaningful decisions, think strategically, and try to survive as long as possible. However, enabling the player to survive forever through skill alone renders the game boring. One popular way to solve this problem, is by injecting some randomness. Now players are a dice-roll away from thriving (or failing).</p>

<p>But how do we maintain this knife-edge? Give the player too much and their dice rolls become meaningless. Be too harsh and every run feels horribly unfair. To better understand how to successfully design TLR, we will need to dig into the numbers.</p>



<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/3/LongRoadJumpHD.gif"></p>

<p>There are three resources in The Long Road: food, weapons, and scavengers. Scavengers eat your food to survive: more scavengers need more food and without it, they die. Weapons enable combat options in conflicts — outcomes are better with them than without… The game ends only when you run out of scavengers.</p>

<p>TLR is turn-based, allowing the player to choose one of four directions to move in during each turn. Each new tile you explore may give you either some resources, a conflict, or nothing at all. At the end of the turn, your scavengers consume some of your food (or starve and die). The Long Road includes a healthy serving of randomness, but we want to know how long the player should <em>expect</em> a game to last. Let’s start with some simple first steps.</p>

<h2 id="wanderers-not-yet-scavengers">Wanderers, not yet scavengers</h2>

<p>For now, forget about the randomness and look at a simplified problem. If scavengers found no resources, how long would they last on the long road?</p>

<p>Let \(X_t\) be our food at the start of turn \(t\), and \(Y_t\) be our scavenger count. Each scavenger consumes \(\alpha &gt; 0\) food per turn. Remember, the game runs out when the last scavenger dies (\(Y_t &lt; 1\)). In this simplified version of TLR, the food changes each turn using the following rule,</p>

\[X_{t+1} = \max(X_{t} - \alpha Y_{t}, 0).\]

<p>Additionally, each excess unit of food that is consumed leads to a scavenger’s death:</p>

\[Y_{t+1} = Y_{t} + \min(0, X_{t} - \alpha Y_{t}).\]

<p>This is already looking pretty complicated, but we can make better sense of this by picking some specific values. If we take \(\alpha = 0.5\) for example, then in each turn we consume food equal to half of our scavengers. And if we have zero food left, then half of our scavengers die each turn.</p>

<p>The quantity we care about here is how many turns we can last before we hit game over, i.e., the smallest \(t\) with \(Y_{t} &lt; 1\). First, how many turns before we run out of food? This is given by \(X_{0} / (\alpha Y_{0})\). After this point, the scavenger count evolves like,</p>

\[Y_{t} = (1 - \alpha) Y_{t-1} = (1 - \alpha)^{t} Y_0.\]

<p>Now notice that if \(\alpha \geq 1\), then it takes only one turn for all of the scavengers to starve to death once the food has run out. If the scavengers ration better (\(\alpha &lt; 1\)), then we need,</p>

\[t &gt; \frac{- \log(Y_0)}{\log (1 - \alpha)},\]

<p>turns for all of the scavengers to starve (\(Y_t &lt; 1\)). So the total number of turns is roughly,</p>

\[\frac{X_{0}}{\alpha Y_0} + \frac{- \log(Y_0)}{\log (1 - \alpha)}.\]

<details>
<summary>Why <i>roughly</i>?</summary>
Remember that the food and scavenger counts are integers but we're ignoring rounding effects here for simplicity.
</details>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/wanderer_sim.gif"></p>

<p>Looking at this quantity, we see that adding more scavengers decreases the total number of turns. While adding more food increases it. On the other hand, as scavengers get more greedy (\(\alpha\) increases) then they last fewer turns.</p>

<p>The animation on the left simulates our boring survival game. Food decreases at a fixed rate until it runs out and the scavenger dies. The red vertical line indicates our predicted stopping point (the first time when the scavenger count is &lt;1).</p>

<h2 id="scavengers">Scavengers</h2>

<p>Let’s make things slightly more interesting. Now our scavengers have learned that to survive they need to find more food, and friends. In each turn, scavengers find \(C &gt; 0\) more food, and \(K &gt; 0\) new scavengers join the group. The group then consumes the food at rate \(\alpha &lt; 1\) per scavenger. Our new food dynamics are given by,</p>

\[X_{t+1} = \max(X_{t} - \alpha (Y_{t} + K) + C, 0).\]

<p>Each turn, scavengers consume food — including the \(K\) new friends we found — but we also gain \(C\) new food. Similarly, the scavenger dynamics become,</p>

\[Y_{t+1} = Y_{t} + K + \min(0, X_{t} - \alpha (Y_{t} + K) + C).\]

<p>We gain the \(K\) new scavengers, but we may also lose some scavengers to starvation. How many turns can the scavengers last now?</p>

<p>First, notice that if \(C &gt; \alpha (Y_t + K)\) then the scavengers gain food on each turn. But the number of scavengers is always increasing by \(K\). The scavengers will stabilize when \(X_{t} - \alpha (Y_t + K) + C = -K\). When this condition holds, we also have \(X_t = 0\). Solving these together, we get the equilibrium point,</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/scavenger_sim.gif"></p>

\[X^* = 0,\:\:\: Y^* = \frac{C + K}{\alpha} - K.\]

<p>On the right, we see a simulation of these dynamics. The red horizontal line indicates the stable point for the scavengers, which is reached before 10 steps.</p>

<p>So long as \(\alpha &lt; (C + K) / K\) (this is always true when \(\alpha &lt; 1\)), each turn some scavengers die and are replaced anew. But sadism aside, this isn’t very exciting for the player — they can never lose! How can we fix this?</p>

<h2 id="scavengers-scavenge-sometimes">Scavengers scavenge, sometimes</h2>

<p>Instead of giving a constant amount of food and scavengers to the player, let’s make each of them random. With probability \(p &lt; 1\) the player gains \(C\) food, with probability \(q &lt; 1 - p\) the player gains \(K\) scavengers, and otherwise nothing.</p>

<p>Our dynamics are now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic">stochastic</a>, meaning sometimes things go up and sometimes they go down. They also form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>; the present state tells us everything that we need to know about predicting the future.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/stoch_scavenger_sim.gif"><br>
This leads to much more interesting dynamics.</p>

<p>The stochastic dynamics are significantly more complicated than the deterministic cases before. We now care about a random variable: the stopping time of the process (when the number of scavengers goes below 1). We need to reason about this random variable in terms of its distribution or moments, e.g. the expected value. <strong>I’d love to say more about this, but I haven’t figured it out yet… Let me know if you have any ideas or a reference that might help!</strong></p>

<p>Regardless, being able to simulate these systems lets us estimate the stopping time and figure out how tweaking parameters under the hood of our game will affect the average run time and variance within. This is powerful when it comes to balancing — we can instantly simulate a simplified run of the game and get an idea of how long things should last.</p>



<p>In this post, we explored only a simplified version of the game. However, the dynamics that we explored are close to the ones we utilize in TLR. [There are a few differences and maybe I’ll explore these in a future post…] On the other hand, we completely ignored several important components that make up our game.</p>

<h2 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h2>

<p>Instead of gaining a random amount of resources, players might find themselves faced with a conflict in which they must decide what to do. The outcome from their choice is random, and can range from wonderful to catastrophic. Weapons become useful during conflicts, where they unlock additional choices that are more likely to have favourable outcomes.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/TLR_Cultist_Conflict.png"></p>

<p>Conflicts are an additional layer of complexity in TLR’s dynamics, and also provide the player with greater agency — something that good balance should take into account. We want the player to feel that they are making meaningful decisions that impact their fate while maintaining that knife-edge balance.</p>

<h2 id="biomes">Biomes</h2>

<p><img src="https://blog.glasstomegames.co.uk/assets/images/posts/4/biomes.png"></p>

<p>In addition to our three resources, TLR has three different biomes to explore. Each has its own set of rules governing how the player’s resources change. Forests provide the player with more food but fewer weapons. The wastelands provide very few resources but are generally low-risk. And the cities provide plentiful resources, but have a high chance of dangerous conflicts.</p>

<p>Balancing around the biomes is also tricky. We want to encourage the player to move strategically between biomes. One way in which we do this is by restricting conflicts to occur only in specific biomes, meaning the player will need to explore to uncover more of the story. Additionally, explored tiles don’t give any new resources/conflicts so that the player must keep moving. We are thinking hard about how the different dynamics in each biome can be combined to give well-balanced, meaningful gameplay.</p>



<p>This post only scratches the surface on balancing TLR. We showed, quantitatively, that randomness is needed to make the game interesting. Without it, the survival dynamics become predictable and unexciting. However, we will need to revisit these ideas and build out more complex models to make meaningful balance decisions.</p>

    <p>A retail investor would be forgiven for assuming that there are really
only two assets classes one should consider for personal investments:
equities (stocks) and fixed income (bonds). Wherever you look, these two
asset classes dominate the financial landscape. All robo-advisors and
most personal advisors implement a mix of bonds and equities for the
portfolios of their clients. The idea behind this mix is simple: bonds
are low risk and will earn you a marginal return, while equities are
riskier and will be the real engine of returns in good times. In bad
times, bonds will rise, mitigating some of the losses of your equity
portfolio: it's been long known and accepted that stocks and bonds have
a negative correlation. Tying this strategy together is periodic
rebalancing, taking money off the table during bull markets (and moving
them to the safer bonds), and deploying money to the equity portion
during bear markets. This in effect overlays a mean-reversion strategy
onto the portfolio, boosting the returns of an otherwise static
portfolio. The archetypal allocation is 60% equities, and 40% bonds,
though each investor's allocation is going to differ based on his risk
tolerance, age, and personal goals.</p>

<p>Though there's nothing wrong with this two asset class mix, the
historically negative correlation between stocks and bonds means that in
most market environments, bonds are going to drag down the portfolio.
Ideally, we would want to mix in uncorrelated assets and investments
instead of negatively correlated ones, in order to reduce the volatility
of our portfolio without dragging down our returns. Alternative
investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, metals, or real estate
all serve this purpose. These alternative investments are not only
popular for their occasionally spectacular returns, but also for their
low correlation to the broader equity market. For this post, we'll use
the oldest and possibly most maligned investment, gold, and explore ways
to mix it into a pure equity, S&amp;P 500 portfolio.</p>

<h2 id="gold">Gold</h2>

<p>Gold and other metals are an interesting and, unfortunately,
underappreciated asset class. The much derided "gold-bug" is made out
to be paranoid, crazy, and irrational. Despite being so rare and
valuable, the percentage of the world's gold supply that is used for
industrial uses is comparatively small, creating a phenomenon that
untethers the price of gold from other asset classes. Let's look at the
returns of gold versus the S&amp;P 500 between 2010-01-01 and 2020-07-08:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/gold.png" alt="S&amp;P 500 vs Gold"></p>

<p>It's evident that the returns of gold are unspectacular, to say the
least. It doesn't seem to consistently lose or gain value as much as it
meanders around, seemingly uncorrelated to the S&amp;P 500. And indeed, it
is almost entirely uncorrelated, with a correlation to the S&amp;P 500 of
only 1% over this time period. Is it even worth including in our
portfolio? And if it is, how would we determine the allocation size?</p>

<h2 id="monte-carlo">Monte-Carlo</h2>

<p>To clarify, we're trying to determine the weights for the S&amp;P 500 and
gold parts of our portfolio, taking on no leverage:</p><p>

\[|x_a| + |x_b| = 1\]

</p><p>And maximizing the risk-adjusted return. For every unit of risk we take,
we would like to maximize the amount of return we receive. We'll first
start off by doing the most straightforward thing, and randomly choosing
different weights for our two asset portfolio and then graphing them:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/ef.png" alt="Return vs Volatility"></p>

<p>This hyperbola formed is called the <em>Markowitz Bullet</em>, after Harry
Markowitz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics for his work on
<em>Modern Portfolio Theory</em>. The portfolio with the best return vs
volatility profile is called the <em>frontier</em> or <em>efficient</em> portfolio.
There exists only one such portfolio and it is the portfolio every
rational investor should prefer, ignoring borrowings costs and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_tax">volatility drag</a> (for
more information about volatility drag, check out my other post
<a href="https://cryptm.org/posts/2019/11/28/div.html">here</a>, or the beginning
of my three part series
<a href="https://cryptm.org/posts/2019/10/04/vol.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>While it's relatively easy to find what would have been the frontier
portfolio looking backwards, it is much more difficult to estimate the
frontier portfolio over some future time period. We can forecast and
then reduce future volatility with modest accuracy, but forecasting
expected return is a notoriously difficult problem. So difficult, in
fact, that few quantitative investors even try, instead resigning
themselves to solely minimize volatility. Likewise, we'll resign
ourselves to the same fate.</p>

<p>In the general case of a many asset portfolio, no closed form solution
can be found for the minimization of volatility, we must instead use an
optimizer or do a Monte-Carlo simulation; but in the two asset case, we
can find a symbolic solution. So that's what we'll do next!</p>

<h2 id="symbolic-solution">Symbolic Solution</h2>

<p>Recall that our portfolio return is going to be a function of our two
assets and their weights:</p><p>

\[P = x_a X_a+ x_b X_b\]

</p><p>Likewise, our expected portfolio mean would look like:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   E[P] &amp;= \mu_P\\
   &amp;= x_a E[X_a] + x_b E[X_b]\\
   &amp;= x_a \mu_a + x_b \mu_b\\
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>And the equation for variance:</p><p>

\[\text{Var}[X] = \sigma^2 = E[(X-\mu)^2]\]

</p><p>Covariance is similar, except instead of squaring, we multiply each
variable after demeaning:</p><p>

\[\text{Cov}[X,Y] = E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]\]

</p><p>Now we just need to derive the portfolio variance:</p><p>

\[\text{Var}[P] = \text{Var}[x_aX_a + x_b X_b]\]

</p><p>First we substitute for variance and rearrange:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   \text{Var}[x_aX_a + x_b X_b] =&amp; E[(x_aX_a + x_b X_b - E[x_a X_a + x_b X_b])^2]\\
   =&amp; E[(x_a X_a - E[x_a X_a] + x_b X_b - E[x_b X_b])^2]
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>Now we can pull the constants out of the expectations, substitute, and
expand:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   \text{Var}[x_a X_a + x_b X_b] =&amp; E[(x_a (X_a - \mu_a) + x_b (X_b - \mu_b))^2] \\
   =&amp; E[x_a^2(X_a - \mu_a)^2 + x_b^2(X_b - \mu_b)^2 + 2 x_a x_b (X_a - \mu_a)(X_b - \mu_b)]
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>Finally, we break up the expectations, and replace:</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
   \text{Var}[x_a X_a + x_b X_b] =&amp; x^2_a E[(X_a - \mu_a)^2] + x^2_b E[X_b - \mu_b] + 2x_a x_b E[(X_a-\mu_a)(X_b-\mu_b)]\\
   =&amp; x^2_a \sigma_a^2 + x^2_b \sigma_b^2 + 2 x_a x_b \text{Cov}[X_a,X_b]\\
   =&amp; x^2_a \sigma_a^2 + x^2_b \sigma_b^2 + 2 x_a x_b \rho_{ab} \sigma_a \sigma_b
   \end{align}\]

</p><p>Where $\rho_{ab}$ is the correlation between $X_a$ and $X_b$:</p><p>

\[\rho_{ab} = \frac{\text{Cov}[X_a,X_b]}{\sigma_a\sigma_b}\]

</p><p>Now that we have an equation for variance in terms of the weights, mean,
volatility, and correlation between the two assets, we can formulate our
objective:</p><p>

\[\min\left( \text{Var}[x_aX_a + x_b X_b]\right)\]

</p><p>Where:</p><p>

\[x_a + x_b = 1\]

</p><p>We perform the substitution $x_b = 1 - x_a$ and then take the derivative
with respect to $x_a$:</p><p>

\[\frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma_P}{\mathrm{d}x_a}=2 \, \rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - 2 \, \sigma_{b}^{2} - 2 \, {\left(2 \, \rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - \sigma_{a}^{2} - \sigma_{b}^{2}\right)} x_{a}\]

</p><p>Now we set to 0 and solve for $x_a$:</p><p>

\[x_{a} = \frac{\rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - \sigma_{b}^{2}}{2 \, \rho_{\mathit{ab}} \sigma_{a} \sigma_{b} - \sigma_{a}^{2} - \sigma_{b}^{2}}\]

</p><p>And $x_b$:</p><p>

\[x_b = 1 - x_a\]

</p><p>Note that sometimes this equation will give us values for $x_a$ and
$x_b$ that imply leverage, i.e:</p><p>

\[|x_a| + |x_b| &gt; 1\]

</p><p>But we can always rescale them by dividing each one by $|x_a| + |x_b|$.
In the next section, we'll put this formula to work.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-weights">Portfolio Weights</h2>

<p>We're going to use a one year or 252 day rolling window to generate the
weights. Everyday, we slide our window over one and generate the new
weights for that day. Below is the generated graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/gw.png" alt="S&amp;P 500 Weight vs Gold weight"></p>

<p>Well that's interesting, the weights change considerably over time. In
a real portfolio, not only would we be using an optimizer and a
multitude of risk factors to determine the weights, but we would also
have constraints on position size, turnover, and the magnitude of
deviation from the "ideal" portfolio, and etc. But even in this simple
and contrived example, we see that our formula is doing its job: as the
volatility of the S&amp;P 500 increases, like at the end of 2018 and during
Coronavirus, we start cutting back our equity exposure.</p>

<p>Let's now look at the returns of our portfolio compared to both gold
and the S&amp;P 500:</p>

<p><img src="https://cryptm.org/assets/altr.png" alt="Portfolio vs S&amp;P 500 vs Gold"></p>

<p>A lot of gains from the market are given up, as we might have expected,
but the return stream becomes a lot less volatile. Just looking at a
graph of cumulative returns isn't super informative, so here's a table
of various metrics:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Gold</th>
      <th>S&amp;P 500</th>
      <th>Portfolio</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Vol</td>
      <td>15.8%</td>
      <td>17.4%</td>
      <td>10.8%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Ret</td>
      <td>4.3%</td>
      <td>12.4%</td>
      <td>8.4%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Beta</td>
      <td>0.01</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0.41</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ann. Sharpe</td>
      <td>0.27</td>
      <td>0.71</td>
      <td>0.77</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Wow! Our volatility is lower than either gold or the S&amp;P 500 alone, our
beta has been cut more than in half compared to the S&amp;P 500, and our
Sharpe ratio is even higher than both! Even with mixing in an asset that
had poor returns and high volatility, we've managed to construct a
portfolio that, on a risk-adjusted basis, is superior to the S&amp;P 500.
And, if we so desired, could be levered up in order to beat the return
of the S&amp;P 500, while maintaining comparatively low volatility.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Even with a bad Sharpe ratio and less than stellar returns, gold
enhanced our pure equity portfolio. The same also can be said about
other, more popular, alternative investments. Hedge funds specifically
are often derided for their low returns and frequent meltdowns (such as
Long-Term Capital Management); but like with gold, looks can be
deceiving. Returns and volatility aren't the whole story. When
designing a portfolio, each individual investment is irrelevant, and
instead the return stream of the portfolio as a whole is what matters.
Considered in isolation, a lot of alternative investments look
sub-optimal and irrational. It is only when you zoom out and think about
the needs of the investor (their existing allocations, investment goals,
monetary needs, etc) does everything come into perspective. When it
comes to investing, the whole is certainly greater than the sum of its
parts!</p>

<p><span>iOS devices became widely used in an enterprise level daily-work now a days, due to this we&nbsp;need to have guaranteed secure communications between device and associated enterprise services.</span></p>
<p>So question raise about enterprise environment security which can be covered with the help of&nbsp;<strong>VPN</strong>&nbsp;or any other third party tool. Actually what VPN does is creating&nbsp;<strong>secure tunnel</strong>&nbsp;between&nbsp;<strong>identity</strong>&nbsp;device and service which is hosted on&nbsp;cloud or on partner networks.</p>
<p>Thats one part of accessing enterprise service but what if we don’t want to use any VPN client and still wants to access enterprise service from any device in our case we are taking&nbsp;<strong>iOS device</strong>.<span>One way of doing that is using&nbsp;<strong>digital certificates</strong>&nbsp;to encrypt/decrypt, sign and authenticate communications and data.So how we can use certificate on iOS device at&nbsp;<strong>system leve</strong>l so that iOS can use that certificate while consuming services.&nbsp;<strong>Advantage</strong>&nbsp;of this over VPN is,&nbsp;User has login every time on VPN Client to consume services where as deploying certificate on iOS device is one time activity and it will work all along till User removed certificate.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://amitdhadse.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/ssl-certificate.png?w=224&amp;h=186" alt="ssl-certificate" width="224" height="186"></p>
<p><span>I have been asked to create an iOS app to request and deploy digital certificates in device system keychain so that, it will be recognised by all system apps of iOS while accessing enterprise services. After doing my research I concluded that in iOS devices there are two types of certificate keychain stores:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>App certificates keychain store:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><span>This keychain store embedded<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>in app space and can be used by that app only.(Not exposed at system level)</span></li>
<li>Apple offer APIs to Insert/Delete/Update certificate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>System certificate keychain store:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This keychain is exposed at system level. This store located in Setting -&gt; General -&gt; Profiles used for VPN and wifi networks</li>
<li>Apple does not offer any API to&nbsp;<span>deploy/retrieve certificates from the system certificate keychain store (Profiles)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>So there are four ways to deploy certificates to system certificate keychain store (not programmatically):</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong><em>Configuration Profiles</em></strong>: Pre-configured profiles that used to distribute settings.(These can be created on MAC and deploy in iOS device)</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Using Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol (SCEP)</em>:</strong>&nbsp;this protocol enables Over-the-Air Enrolment of digital certificates, mainly used for routers and switches.</span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Email Attachment</em>:</strong>&nbsp;send the certificate from a desktop or mac to iOS device as an email attachment. Open this attachment(certificate) in iOS mail client ( having system privileges ). It will automatically ask you for installation.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span><strong><em>Using Safari</em>:</strong>&nbsp;browse the certificate using Safari. Safari has system privileges over normal UIWebView.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>After I did my research I found a workaround that worked for me to deploy a certificate to the System Certificate Store from Xcode directly.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what you will need to do, first, to create a web-server inside your App, then save the certificate in this web-server and open it’s URL.</span></p>
<p><span>When the page launches, Safari will recognize that it’s a certificate, then the System Profiles will pop up and ask the user to install the certificate. After the user install the certificate it will be saved to the Profiles and the certificate can be used in the System level.</span></p>
<p><span>To create web server inside iOS app, there are 2-3 libraries are available on Git. I recommend “<strong>GCDWebserver</strong>” library to create web server due to its easy implementation, background support and most important it is stable.</span></p>
<p><span>How to use&nbsp;<strong>GCDWebserver</strong>&nbsp;:-</span></p>
<pre><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span><b>let</b></span> localServer = <span>GCDWebDAVServer</span>(uploadDirectory: path)
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>localServer?.start(withPort: <span>8080</span>, bonjourName: <span><b>nil</b></span>)
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span><b>let</b></span> url = localServer?.serverURL
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span>UIApplication.shared.open(url)</pre>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Here “path” is your certificate path(in my case it was document directory path as my certificate was store in document directory(NSDocumentDirectory) folder).</li>
<li>“serverURL”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>will return URL of certificate which is hosted on local server.</li>
<li>Open this URL on safari, Safari recognise that it is certificate and pops an installation alert automatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note :-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now in this scenario here is one problem, as soon as user open URL in safari, user were no longer in app all control is shift to safari and to comeback in app, user has to do manually.</em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Solution :- import “</span><strong><span>SafariServices</span></strong><span>”&nbsp;</span>framework which already have a safari view in it which opens safari inside your app.</p>
<p><span>I spent a lot of time and research efforts to reach upto this solution, I hope someone surly will get benefit from my results. Please contact me for any question.</span></p>

<p>One of the most underappreciated features introduced since Go version 1.8 is the Go plugin package. Plugins are one of the many software architectural designs that allow you to build loosely coupled and modular programs. In Go, plugins are written and compiled separately as shared objects (.so) or libraries and can be loaded dynamically during runtime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incorporating extensibility into your programs is always considered a good practice, and there are many approaches to this.

<p>Image processing is a method to perform operations on an image to extract information from it or enhance it. Digital image processing has a broad range of applications such as image restoration, medical imaging, remote sensing, image segmentation, etc. Every process requires a different technique.</p>



<p>In this article, we will be covering the <strong>top 6 image processing techniques</strong> for machine learning.</p>



<ol><li>Image Restoration</li><li>Linear Filtering</li><li>Independent Component Analysis</li><li>Pixelation</li><li>Template Matching</li><li>Image Generation Technique (GAN)</li></ol>

<h2>1. Image restoration</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.postproductie.cinemeta.nl/en/restoration-en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Source</a>&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>An image deteriorates for many reasons, for example, an old image of your grandparents which was taken with the old tech camera could become hazy or may lose its original form.</p>



<p>This could happen if the image goes under some physical stress or if it’s in digital form it could deteriorate by motion blur or additive noise.</p>



<p>So how are you going to restore it? Maybe it wasn’t possible 50 years back but now – it is.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~elec539/Projects99/BACH/proj2/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Researchers came up with a Degradation model</strong></a><strong> that can undo the deterioration effects on the input image. The degradation model works as a convolution with a linear shift-invariant.</strong></p>



<p>So we take an Image before the degradation which is called “True Image” and an Image after degradation which is called “Observed Image” with the degradation filter which <em>estimates</em> the “True Image”.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27716" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-techniques-you-can-use-in-machine-learning/degradation-model" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/degradation-model.png?fit=512%2C56&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="512,56" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="degradation-model" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/degradation-model.png?fit=300%2C33&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/degradation-model.png?fit=512%2C56&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/degradation-model.png?resize=512%2C56&amp;ssl=1" alt="degradation model" width="512" height="56" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/degradation-model.png?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/degradation-model.png?resize=300%2C33&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>





<h3><strong>An example of image restoration using image inpainting with OpenCV</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Image impainting</a> also known as <strong>“Compensation of paint loss ”. </strong>This technique is often used to remove unwanted objects from an image to restore damaged parts of a deteriorated image.</p>



<pre><span>import</span> cv2
  
img = cv2.imread(<span>'damaged_image.png'</span>)
mask = cv2.imread(<span>'mask.png'</span>, <span>0</span>)
dst = cv2.inpaint(img, mask, <span>3</span>, cv2.INPAINT_NS)

cv2.imwrite(<span>'restored.png'</span>, dst)</pre>



<p>In the above code, we have two types of images</p>



<ol><li>Damaged</li><li>Masked</li></ol>



<p>A masked image has the same spatial dimensions of the noise which exists in the noisy image.</p>



<p>So if we input the image below with the above code:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27719" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-techniques-you-can-use-in-machine-learning/image-impainting-1" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-impainting-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=384%2C384&amp;ssl=1" alt="image impainting 1" width="384" height="384" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-1.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>With the mask:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27720" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-techniques-you-can-use-in-machine-learning/image-impainting-2" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-impainting-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="400" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="image impainting 2" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-2.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Then we will get the following image:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="image impainting 3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/image-impainting-3.png?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>The biggest problem with OpenCV’s image inpainting is that we need to manually input a mask for the specific image we want to fix. So how can we automate this process?</p>



<p>The answer is <strong>GAN (General Adversarial Network)</strong>. This <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8686914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper</a> proposes that, by using a GAN network, image inpainting can be done using <strong>neighborhood loss function and gradient loss</strong> with a better quality restored image.&nbsp;</p>





<h2>2. Linear filtering</h2>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="27724" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-techniques-you-can-use-in-machine-learning/linear-filtering" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?fit=1139%2C301&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1139,301" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="linear-filtering" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?fit=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?fit=1024%2C271&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="271" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?resize=1024%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="linear filtering" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?resize=1024%2C271&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?resize=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?resize=768%2C203&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/linear-filtering.png?w=1139&amp;ssl=1 1139w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Linear filtering is a process in which the value of the output pixel is linear combinations of the neighboring input pixels. This process is done by a technique called <strong>Convolution.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Convolution is the process of adding each element of the image to its local neighbors, weighted by the kernel.</strong></p>

<p>We have an input image and a kernel with an anchor point. In the above diagram, it’s H(1, 1).</p>



<p><strong>This filter works as a sliding window to convolve over the image.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We multiply each pixel by the corresponding kernel and then take the sum. That sum becomes a new pixel in the output image.</p>

<p>Independent Component Analysis or short for ICA is a <strong>technique for separating a multivariate signal into its underlying component. </strong>ICA helps in the extraction of the desired component from the mixture of multiple components or signals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let me explain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In ICA, we <em>“Whiten”</em> our signal. This means that a given will be transformed in a way that potential correlations between its component are removed and the variance of each component is equal to 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Template matching is a method for searching and finding the location of a <em>template </em>in a <em>larger</em> image. You can think of it as a very simple approach to object detection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In template matching, we slide the <em>template </em>image over the <em>larger</em> image as we do in the convolution process and find the matching part</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04302.pdf"><em>Source</em></a></p>



<p>With the help of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we can train a deep learning model on the image data to generate the same type of image data.</p>



<p>GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 which he described in the paper of <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Generative Adversarial Nets</a>.</p>



<p><strong>GANs are made of two distinct models&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ol><li><strong>Generator</strong></li><li><strong>Discriminator</strong></li></ol>



<p>The job of the <strong>generator</strong> is to generate the <em>fake</em> images and <strong>discriminator</strong> try to classify between the <strong>fake image and real image</strong>. During the training, the <strong>generator</strong> tries to outsmart the discriminator by generating better fake images and the discriminator tries to improve itself for differentiating between the real image and a fake image. You can read more about <a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/6-gan-architectures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GAN architectures and training in this article.&nbsp;</a></p>





<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>So in this&nbsp; article, I briefly explained the most used image processing techniques in any machine learning project:</p>



<ul><li>Linear Filtering</li><li>Image Restoration</li><li>Template Matching</li><li>Image Generation Technique (GAN)</li><li>Pixelation</li><li>Independent Component Analysis</li></ul>



<p>But choosing the right technique requires experience and experience comes from practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So keep learning.</p>

        <p>Last updated Feb. 3, 2014 — read <span id="post-views">25885</span> times</p>

        <p><strong>This post is adapted from <a href="https://mikeknoop.com/iowaconf-road-to-zapier">a talk I gave</a> at <a href="http://iowaconf.com/">iowaconf</a> October 2013</strong></p>

<p>I was one of three co-founders of <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. If you're unfamiliar with the origin story, we got started out of a <a href="http://columbia.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> in Columbia, Mo. in 2011.</p>

<p>The prompt for this talk was to describe “what you learned building Zapier”. The most obvious thing I could share is tactical advice or early anecdotes. Things like how we got our first dozen customers to pay us before we really had a product or how we almost missed our acceptance call into <a href="https://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I'm still leaning <em>a ton</em> through today. Startups are very much “trial-by-fire” as a first-time founder.</p>

<p>But the more I thought about that talk prompt, I realized the biggest thing I learned actually began way, way earlier. It's a lesson that applies equally to launching Zapier as to endeavors which lie beyond.</p>



<p>Growing up I've was always into tech and I loved building things (I originally wanted to be an architect when I thought that's what they did).</p>

<p>I learned how to build websites after borrowing a friend's “Learn HTML in 24 Hours” book. My goal was to build an AOL Instant Messenger profile for myself, which conveniently, could render actual HTML.</p>

<p>Later I learned how to code “hardcore” by picking up assembly language. I did this so I could write TI-83+ calculator games and play them during class (much to the dismay to my teachers growing up).</p>

<p>Towards the end of high school though, it was time to pick a major. Computer Science was the obvious shoe-in. But I didn't want to do it! I feared that I would burn out and not have time/energy for side projects.</p>

<p>So I decided instead to do Mechanical Engineering instead – also maybe not the best choice considering my goal outlined above but at least I wouldn't be coding 24/7 for school.</p>



<p>Facebook was just taking off during my freshman year of college. They launched their original developer platform that fall and I was instantly hooked.</p>

<p>I spent a good chunk of free time building apps. Like this one that you could use to request phone numbers from your fiends.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5f24a618be311e3ae7628cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or this one which was a developer toolkit, making it easy to embed Facebook-style form elements.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e45bf5828be311e3b0bb28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Or even my last solo Facebook endeavor, a monitoring tool for the Facebook Platform, which peaked at a grand total of 1 paying user.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e35826a88be311e3982b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can probably guess: my ROI wasn't too great. But I was very active in the Facebook developer community and made a name for myself. Facebook reached out and asked if I'd like to become a community moderator. I have to imagine this was because of my community participation and not because they looked at any of my app analytics. </p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e5897b478be311e3a69228cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This moderator gig led me to write developer columns for Inside Facebook and in combination, these two things generally kept my around the platform much longer than I otherwise should have.</p>

<p>It did turn out to be useful though.</p>



<p>I was applying for summer engineering internships after my Junior year of college. I applied about two dozen engineering firms in Missouri as well as a few web development gigs.</p>

<p>Of all resume's I sent out I only heard back from one place, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>, a VA loan lender based in Columbia Mo. I learned they wanted to build an app for military personnel to reconnect inside of Facebook.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/e4ebb0e88be311e3864128cfe91e44cb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I worked on Military Basebook for about a year. It peaked around 20,000 monthly active users but ultimately wasn't sticky enough. Around this time I learned a few things:</p>

<p><em>1. Facebook apps that aren't games just don't work well</em></p>

<p>Even today the most successful apps on Facebook are games. Users on Facebook just aren't in mindset to seek out utilities.</p>

<p><em>2. I didn't want to do the traditional engineering career</em></p>

<p>Although the sentiment had been brewing for a while, that summer was a turning point where I actively decided I would focus on side projects post college instead of seeking a full time job. I was going to keep throwing stuff at the wall and see if something stuck.</p>

<p>I began my mechanical engineering masters program (which I ended up dropping out of) as part of this strategy. I was able to secure a 2-year grant which paid for school living expenses. This left me with a lot of free time for my side projects.</p>



<p>Around the middle of my junior year I discovered <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. If you're unfamiliar, it is a lot like Reddit (HN actually came first) where stories and articles are upvoted to the frontpage. Usually people post about programming and startups.</p>

<p>One convention on Hacker News is called “Show HN” which is a way for people to show off their side projects and solicit feedback.</p>

<p>One “Show HN” caught my eye by a user called <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/?user=phpnode">phpnode</a> (thank you phpnode!). He launched a side project called <a href="http://zpr.io/6dM7.png">Hackernewsers</a> which was a map of users who used Hacker News.</p>

<p>The idea was simple. You submit your username, real name, and location and you get access to a map where you can see others who've done the same. I checked out Columbia Mo. and I saw something interesting – there was someone else in the area! It turns out that other person was this guy:</p>

<p>[Bryan Helmig]</p>

<p>I remember clicking through all the information I could find online about him. I found his <a href="http://bryanhelmig.com/">personal blog</a>, some of his <a href="http://rankiac.com/">side projects</a>, and even <a href="http://youtube.com/">his YouTube channel</a>. But the most important thing I learned was that he worked at same company I did, <a href="http://veteransunited.com/">Veterans United</a>.</p>

<p>That was enough of a connection for me so I got in touch over Facebook. We met up several times that year for beers and wanted to work on something together.</p>



<p>Mizzou, the university I attended in Columbia, sent out a weekly email with things happening on campus and in the area. I usually auto-archived these. I must have been pretty bored the day I <a href="http://google.com/">opened this one</a>, but I'm glad I did. I found an enticing headline “Startup Weekend is Coming to Columbia”.</p>

<p>I had never heard of Startup Weekend but I knew I liked building things, I knew I liked startups, so maybe this is something I wanted to be a part of. I then discovered tickets cost $50 and was a bit turned off.</p>

<p>Maybe if I could find someone else going, it would be worth the money. So I messaged Bryan and he said he was going! I bought tickets later that night, and that's how I wound up at Columbia Missouri's first ever Startup Weekend.</p>

<p>At Startup Weekend I formally met <a href="http://wadefoster.net/">Wade Foster</a> who also happened to work at Veterans United. We got together and worked on the project that Bryan originally pitched as “API Mixer”. The idea was simple: make a tool that enables anyone (marketers, sales, HR, developers) to connect together two web services they use.</p>

<p>In true startup fashion we took to the back garage and got to work. The <a href="https://zapier.com/blog">story of Zapier</a> is still being written today.</p>



<p>When I look back on the decisions that lead me to Startup Weekend I am amazed how many times the proverbial train of life could have been derailed.</p>

<p>What if I hadn't opened that email? What if I never got into Facebook development? What if I hadn't worked at Veterans United?</p>

<p>In reminds me a lot of the game Plinko on The Price is Right. The one where the contestant drops the puck down a pegged board and it randomly makes it's way down to one of the buckets at the bottom with the winning bucket in the middle.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9ed525578be311e39e8a28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plinko"></p>

<p>The funny thing about plinko is, if you run sufficiently many trials, the middle bucket is actually the easiest to hit! The outcome follows a normal distribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://mikeknoop.com/static/img/upload/9dfcebde8be311e3ae7b28cfe91e44cb.png" alt="Plink Distrobution"></p>

<p>The take away here is if you go through life making random decisions, statistically, you'll wind up in the middle. While in Plinko the middle is the best, in reality, the really exciting stuff happens at the edges of the board. That's where Zapier happened. And to get there you've got to purposely push yourself towards the outsides.</p>

<p>Although I didn't realize it at the time, there was a guiding principle for all my decisions. I was always putting myself out there, in uncomfortable, new situations that challenged my own status quo.</p>

<p>That's the road to the outside of the Plinko board. And that's the biggest thing I learned by creating Zapier.</p>

<p>The Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that instructs us, how to organize data and function into objects. Those objects are structures that should be designed to reflect the real-world object. Fortunately, we have four principles defined: abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation, that will lead us towards good code quality. Unfortunately, for years I understood them improperly, even if I was really convinced that I know them well. This article has to shorten your way to an understatement of OOP paradigm.</p>



<p>During this article, we will focus mostly on practice with a little theoretical background. Even if all code samples are included, you can clone <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pawelpluta/oop-kata" target="_blank">GIT repository with sources</a> and follow each change. At the end of the article, you can continue learning by doing kata. To simplify work, we will skip unit testing. Let’s check, what are we going to work on.</p>





<h2><span id="The_Washing_Machine">The Washing&nbsp;Machine</span></h2>



<p>Application, that we are working, is a representation of a washing machine. Seems like it is nothing special, just put clothes inside and start it, so the laundry is being done. On the other hand, when we start to gather requirements that ordinary washing machine has to do, it grows into at least a few point list.</p>



<ul><li>It must wash any laundry that we have</li><li>Must provide dedicated programs for a different type of fabric</li><li>Programs for fabrics must be adjustable in the matter of temperature and spin speed</li><li>It should not be possible to insert too many laundry into the washer</li></ul><p>We could add more and more requirements to the list, but let’s stop for now, and make those four a little bit more precise.</p>



<ul><li>Supported fabrics are wool, cotton and silk</li><li>Wool can be washed only in temperature up to 40°C, with spin speed between 100 and 400 rounds per minute</li><li>Cotton can be washed in temperature between 30 and 95°C, with spin speed up to 1200 RPM</li><li>The maximum temperature for silk is 30°C and up to 300 RPM</li><li>The default value for temperature and spin speed will be its maximum value</li><li>The washer should have protection for putting over 7 kilograms of laundries</li></ul><h3><span id="Development_of_the_first_version_of_the_application">Development of the first version of the application</span></h3>



<p>We are going to code the application in a way that some controller will provide laundry to the core of the application — the Washing Service. Washing Service will use the Washing Machine to perform wash. This version of the code will be a base for applying OOP principles. On purpose, we are going to design and implement it in a way that I have seen in multiple projects and companies. Writing Object-Oriented code is not only about using classes, but we also need to model it in a very precise way. For now, we will start with the following diagram.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="316" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-1024x316.png" alt="Application desing might already say, that there is high probability of violating OOP principles." srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-1024x316.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-300x93.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-768x237.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1-1536x475.png 1536w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WashingMachineV1.png 1563w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Simplified diagram for our application that violates OOP. It is composed of few classes.</figcaption></figure><p>We will start with defining two, the most valuable elements of the whole application: <code>Laundry</code> and <code>WashingMachine</code>. They are mentioned multiple times in the requirements, so let’s take a look at code that we are going, to begin with. You can also clone the GitHub repo and follow all the changes in your favourite IDE.</p>






<p>Base class that will keep laundry.</p>



<p>Supported fabric types are defined in the requirements, so we decided to keep them as an enum and hope it will not change pretty often.</p>






<p>Currently, our application will support three types of fabric.</p>



<p>The last thing from model classes is the washing machine itself. From the description, we may conclude that it will spin with different speeds and will do laundry at different temperatures. Also, it will, of course, perform wash and clean up the laundry.</p>






<p>Main, currently agnostic, Washing Machine class.</p>



<p>Model classes are fairly simple and represent object attributes pretty well. What we do not have here is the logic described in requirements for the application. We are going to implement it as a <code>WashingService</code>. The logic that will manage the washing process is represented by three <code>wash</code> methods.</p>



<p>We will focus on one of the methods, let’s say, <code>washWool</code> and later will duplicate the solution of all of the programs. Wool should be by default wash at a temperature of 40 degrees and with the spin speed set up to 400 RPM. Before we set up our laundry, we also have to sort it by fabric type and get only the ones that we are currently interested in. We need to remember also required check for each of the parameters, so we will not exceed values defined for a program.</p>






<p>The whole logic is currently in Service class, together with value checks.</p>



<p>Having washing logic in place, we need the last piece of the puzzle — something that will invoke the washing process. The controller here is responsible for obtaining all laundry and providing it to the <code>WashingService</code> so it will do the laundry. This part of the application can be changed, depending on the presentation layer, so we are not going to keep here any logic. Keeping logic apart from this class ensures us that all possible controllers will use the same process.</p>






<h2><span id="How_hard_we_broke_OOP">How hard we broke&nbsp;OOP?</span></h2>



<p>Even if you do not see it yet, we already violated Object-Oriented Principles pretty hard. A lot of logic is now in the service, that is very specific to washer programmes. In the matter of encapsulation, we are taking out the internals of the washing machine and perform some operations on it. It is equivalent to pouring water with a bucket into the washer, instead of letting washing machine to take up the right amount — it is clearly violating OOP’s principles. What would happen, if new requirements would appear, like no drain function or double rinse? Adding such features to the service will quickly make it hard to maintain. Pretty easily we will reach a dead-end when code becomes unmaintainable.</p>



<h3><span id="Problems_with_lack_of_Object-Oriented_approach">Problems with lack of Object-Oriented approach</span></h3>



<p>Till now, we have implemented an application that does not follow OOP principles, even if it might look to do. Our <code>WashingService</code> is on a good way to become a big class that handles all washing-related logic. It is visible, that we are facing some problems:</p>



<ul><li>Moving value checks from Washing Machine to Service may lead to inconsistency. All services using Washing Machine needs to know, what are its limitations. What will happen, if we will have another, smaller Washing Machine, that may operate only on a maximum of 5 kg of laundry? We would have to update all services that are using it.</li><li>Adding new service will require to implement exactly the same checks. If we would need to add a <code>DryingService</code>, then it is needed to duplicate the code. Logic centralized in service instead of the object makes it hard to be reused.</li><li>Extensive code is not easy to test. A lot of possible ways of execution for every method makes automated tests heavy (a lot of preparation) and overlapping (a common part of methods is tested by multiple tests)</li></ul><p>Without following OOP, classes and tests may become heavy. Right now, to fully test all paths within <code>washWool</code> method, we will need up to 32 unit test — just for this one method. I find it one of the core reasons for developers not writing unit tests — they are too big and require a lot of data preparation. Now we know, what is the problem with our code, and we do know how it should work. Time to make this code Object-Oriented!</p>



<h2><span id="Inheritance_of_clothes">Inheritance of&nbsp;clothes</span></h2>



<p>While going into a clothing store, you can choose from multiple fabrics that clothes are made, yet all clothes have the same abilities — they can be put on, worn, stained and cleaned. Depending on the way you are looking at clothes, they can be categorized by different characteristics. You can distinguish them by type of clothes (shirts, jackets, trousers), but they are still clothes.</p>



<p>Inheritance in OOP is something, that allows for generalisation of specific things. Depending on that with who you are talking to, you might need to be more specific, or perform conversation on a general level. For example, imagine a situation when you are walking into a store, and shop assistant approaches you. It would be more valuable to say that you need a pair of trousers than saying you need some clothes. On the other hand, while talking to a friend that you meet on a street, it is perfectly fine to say that you are going to buy some clothes. Inheritance allows you to refer to jackets and trousers as clothes.</p>



<h3><span id="Inheritance_vs_polymorphism">Inheritance vs polymorphism</span></h3>



<p>While inheritance is about copying behaviours and attributes, polymorphism is about changing behaviour in subclasses. In Java, they are strictly connected — if <code>Clothes</code> has a <code>cleanUp()</code> method, to change its behaviour we have to extend <code>Clothes</code> in <code>Jacket</code> class. So, in Java, the OOP polymorphism is fulfilled by extension.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-1024x614.png" alt="" srcset="https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-1024x614.png 1024w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-300x180.png 300w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes-768x461.png 768w, https://pawelpluta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OOP-OverridingClothes.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>In Java, to realize OOP Polymorphism, we need to use inheritance</figcaption></figure><h3><span id="Applying_inheritance_to_washing_elements">Applying inheritance to washing&nbsp;elements</span></h3>



<p>Inheritance is clear <code>is-a</code> relation. If <code>Jacket</code> extends <code>Clothes</code>, then <code>Jacket is-a Clothes</code>. While thinking of laundry, we usually do not care if we are washing jackets or anything else. More important is the type of fabric – in our case they were distinguished by enum property. It works, but it is promoting direct access to the internals of the object. This may lead to breaking the encapsulation and gives the possibility to put the object into an invalid state. Having it in a property inside class requires you to search for this information inside the object – it is like looking for a clothes tag and reading it every time you want to wash this piece of clothes.</p>

Photo by <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Roland_Russwurm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roland Russwurm</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s change our code. To make <code>LaundryElement</code> class more OOP focused, we will have to do multiple things. Let’s start with making it an abstract class, so it will become the base for inheritance. Another small, but important step is making fields immutable where possible. This will prevent instances of this class being vulnerable to direct field changes. The only field that is mutating is the <code>dirty</code> flag.</p>



<p>To modify <code>dirty</code> flag, we will not use <code>set</code> method. Instead of that, we will hide it behind a …</p></div></div>

					<p>Deze week hebben we een stap gezet waarvan we dachten dat we hem nooit zouden moeten zetten: we hebben de NOS-logo`s laten verwijderen van de auto`s waarmee we elke dag op pad zijn om verslaggevers een werkplek te bieden en om radio- en televisieverbindingen met Hilversum te leggen. Voortaan zijn deze auto`s, kleine vrachtwagens eigenlijk, niet meer herkenbaar als auto`s van de NOS.</p>										<p>Helaas, het is nodig voor de veiligheid van de mensen die elke dag voor de NOS op pad zijn. We hebben er maanden over getwijfeld, we wilden het per se niet, want we willen als publieke journalistieke organisatie juist zichtbaar en aanspreekbaar zijn, maar het kan zo niet verder.</p>
<p>Vrijwel dagelijks worden collega`s die onderweg zijn, geconfronteerd met opgestoken middelvingers, er wordt afval naar ze gegooid, ze worden afgesneden op de snelweg en een enkeling remt zelfs hard vlak voor onze auto`s. Als zo`n NOS-auto stil staat om in te werken, wordt dat onmogelijk gemaakt door erop te bonzen. Als we worden uitgescholden en of in meer of mindere mate bedreigd, valt dat al bijna niet meer op.</p>
<p>En het gaat niet alleen om wat er feitelijk gebeurt, maar zeker ook om de angst dat je wat overkomt of wordt aangedaan.</p>
<p>Eerder namen we het besluit standaard bewaking meesturen als we verslag doen van publieksmanifestaties en nu dan de logo`s eraf. Zo diep zijn we gezonken en het verbijsterende is: het is allemaal in korte tijd snel anders geworden. Deze discussie kwam in het voorjaar op, maar toen nog zeiden de technici dat ze logo`s zeker niet kwijt wilden. Herkenbaarheid en trots op het bedrijf waar ze voor werken, gaven toen nog de doorslag.</p>
<p>De journalistiek ligt onder vuur van mensen en groeperingen, die alleen hun eigen wereld willen terugzien, elk ander perspectief onmogelijk proberen te maken en daarmee de persvrijheid aantasten. Dit besluit is een nederlaag voor de NOS, maar vooral voor de journalistiek. Bij <a href="https://www.persveilig.nl/">Persveilig</a> zijn binnen een jaar meer dan 100 meldingen van agressie tegen journalisten binnengekomen. De journalistiek is een fundament voor onze democratie, moet onbelemmerd kunnen functioneren en daarin gesteund worden. Juist nu en veel meer dan gebeurt.</p>

<div>
  <p>By <b>Julius Choudhury</b></p>
  
  <p>
    Businesses that need to raise funds in a hurry often have two options –
    borrow money from a lender or raise capital from investors. Both options
    have their benefits and drawbacks. By understanding the pros and cons of
    each, you can work out which is the best option for your business. Below are
    the two options weighed up.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Borrowing money</h3>
  <p>
    Many people find borrowing money to be a lot more straightforward than
    seeking investment. Nowadays, you can borrow money with the click of a
    button or the swipe of a card. You don’t even need to have a good credit
    score.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Of course, when it comes to borrowing large amounts, the application process
    can be a little more complicated – you may need to present a business plan
    to someone in person. If you want access to low interest rates, a good
    credit score can also help.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Once you take out a loan, you have to pay back the full amount regardless of
    whether your business succeeds or not. There are means of wiping debt, but
    often have to be on the verge of bankruptcy to consider these options. The
    flipside is that once your loan is paid off with interest, it’s gone
    forever, resulting in one less outgoing cost.
  </p>
  
  <div><p>
    You should always shop around before borrowing money to find the best
    interest rates and repayment schedule. This guide
    </p><u><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2020/03/06/the-best-small-business-loans/" target="_blank">at Forbes</a></u><p>
    offers tips on finding the best business loan.
  </p></div>
  
  <p>Some different ways of borrowing money include:</p>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Bank loans:</b> These loans tend to come with lower interest rates,
        but higher eligibility requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Private lenders:</b> These loans tend to come with lower eligibility
        requirements, but higher interest rates.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Lines of credit:</b> These allow you to borrow money continuously up
        to a certain limit.
        <u><a href="https://edition.dearjulius.com/2019/02/4-reasons-to-use-credit-card-when.html" target="_blank">Credit cards</a></u>
        are reliant on a line of credit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Peer-to-peer lending:</b> This involves borrowing money from
        individual lenders.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h3>Seeking investment</h3>
  <div><p>
    Seeking out investment involves offering shares in future profits in
    exchange for funding. It can be a little more complicated than applying to a
    loan – because investors are only certain to make a return if your business
    succeeds, you must prove to these investors that you are a successful
    business. This could mean having to present a detailed
    </p><u><a href="https://articles.bplans.com/how-to-write-a-business-plan/" target="_blank">business plan</a></u><p>
    and make a pitch in some cases.
  </p></div>
  
  <p>
    Unlike a loan in which you owe a specific amount of money, the amount of
    money you owe to investors is completely dependent on how successful your
    business is. For many people, this can make it preferential to a loan. The
    one drawback is that you may pay investors more in the long run than you
    would pay a lender.
  </p>
  
  <div><p>
    Some investors and advisors may be able to offer expertise as well as
    helping you to achieve funding. When seeking investment and advice, it’s
    worth always looking up credentials of individuals and organizations such as
    these credentials of Adam Blumenthal
    </p><u><a href="https://www.businessnews.com.au/Person/Adam-Blumenthal" target="_blank">on Business News</a></u><p>. It could also be worth researching into past clients that they’ve worked
    with to get an idea of the businesses they invest in.
  </p></div>
  
  <p>A few different ways of seeking investment include:</p>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Angel investors:</b> This generally involves seeking investment from
        a wealthy individual.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Venture capitalists:</b> These are organizations that tend to invest
        money into new rapidly growing businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Investment banks/advisors:</b> Investment banks help to connect
        companies with multiple individual investors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Crowdfunding:</b> Crowdfunding involves independently seeking
        investment from lots of different investors. Each investor usually only
        invests a small amount.
      </li>
    </ul>

						<p>Ever since the development of the atomic bomb, humanity has possessed the means for its own destruction. There have, of course, always been natural risks of human extinction: an asteroid impact or a supervolcano eruption could make the planet uninhabitable. But since that fateful first nuclear test in the New Mexico desert, the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334769066_An_upper_bound_for_the_background_rate_of_human_extinction/fulltext/5d4043744585153e592e48be/An-upper-bound-for-the-background-rate-of-human-extinction.pdf?origin=publication_detail">primary threat</a> to the survival of human civilization has come from man himself.</p>
<p>In the decades since, the risks from human activity have multiplied. While the median climate change scenario would merely be unpleasant, there is the possibility of <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/fattaileduncertaintyeconomics.pdf">tail-end scenarios</a> that could end civilization as we know it. Advances in biotechnology might allow us to engineer a new pathogen that silently spreads before killing not just millions, but all of humanity. Some, like Elon Musk, fear that we might soon develop artificial intelligence that could go rogue.</p>
<p>Philosophers like <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html">Nick Bostrom</a>, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5506078de4b02d88372eee4e/t/5f36b015d9a3691ba8e1096b/1597419543571/Are+we+living+at+the+hinge+of+history.pdf">Derek Parfit</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Precipice-Existential-Risk-Future-Humanity/dp/0316484911/ref=nodl_">Toby Ord</a> have become increasingly concerned about such so-called “existential risks.” An unrecoverable collapse of civilization wouldn’t just be tragic for the billions who would suffer and die. Perhaps the greatest tragedy would be the foreclosing of all of humanity’s potential. Humanity could flourish for billions of years and enable trillions of happy human lives—if only we do not destroy ourselves beforehand.</p>
<p>This line of thinking has led some to question whether “progress”—in particular, technological progress—is as straightforwardly beneficial as commonly assumed. Nick Bostrom imagines the process of technological development as “<a href="https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf">pulling balls out of a giant urn</a>.” So far, we’ve been lucky, pulling out a great many “white” balls that are broadly beneficial. But someday, we might pull out a “black” ball: a new technology that destroys humanity. Before that first nuclear test, some of the physicists worried that the nuclear bomb would ignite the atmosphere and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/achenblog/wp/2015/07/23/the-man-who-feared-rationally-that-hed-just-destroyed-the-world/">end the world</a>. Their calculations ultimately deemed it “extremely unlikely,” and so they proceeded with the test—which, as it turns out, did not end the world. Perhaps the next time, we don’t get so lucky.</p>
<p>The same technological progress that creates these risks is also what drives economic growth. Does that mean economic growth is inherently risky? Economic growth has brought about extraordinary prosperity. But for the sake of posterity, must we choose safe stagnation instead? This view is arguably becoming ever-more popular, particularly amongst those concerned about climate change; Greta Thunberg recently denounced “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/23/763452863/transcript-greta-thunbergs-speech-at-the-u-n-climate-action-summit?t=1602781084356">fairy tales of eternal economic growth</a>” at the United Nations.</p>
<p>I argue that the opposite is the case. <i>It is not safe stagnation and risky growth that we must choose between; rather, it is stagnation that is risky and it is growth that leads to safety.</i></p>
<p>We might indeed be in “time of perils”: we might be advanced enough to have developed the means for our destruction, but not advanced enough to care sufficiently about safety. But stagnation does not solve the problem: we would simply stagnate at this high level of risk. Eventually, a nuclear war or environmental catastrophe would doom humanity regardless.</p>
<p>Faster economic growth could initially increase risk, as feared. But it will also help us get past this time of perils more quickly. When people are poor, they can’t focus on much beyond ensuring their own livelihoods. But as people grow richer, they start caring more about things like the environment and protecting against risks to life. And so, as economic growth makes people richer, they will invest more in safety, protecting against existential catastrophes. As technological innovation and our growing wealth has allowed us to conquer past threats to human life like smallpox, so can faster economic growth, in the long run, increase the overall chances&nbsp; of humanity’s survival.</p>
<p>This argument is based on a <a href="http://leopoldaschenbrenner.com/xriskandgrowth">recent paper</a> of mine, in which I use the tools of economic theory—in particular, the standard models economists use to analyze economic growth—to examine the interaction between economic growth and the risks engendered by human activity.</p>
<p>In this model, society must choose how much of its resources to allocate to consumption and how much to safety efforts. Consumption makes us happy, but also creates risks of catastrophe. Investing in safety can in turn help mitigate that risk.</p>
<p>For example, consuming fossil fuels can engender great prosperity, but also increases the risk of tail-end climate change. We can spend money on carbon abatement to reduce this risk. Or consider air travel. It’s very useful as well, but also facilitates the spread of infectious diseases, including potentially a pandemic that could wipe out the human race. We can spend money on pandemic preparedness to mitigate that risk.</p>
<p>Crucially, society is impatient; it discounts the future. People generally care most about their more immediate well-being. Although they may care about their kids and grandkids, they are certainly not particularly concerned about the trillions of potential lives billions of years in the future that the aforementioned philosophers appeal to.</p>
<p>However, an impatient society <i>does</i> care about not getting wiped out. Therefore, what fraction of its resources this impatient society will allocate to safety depends on how much the people in this society value their own lives.</p>
<p>As it turns out, under the standard preferences used in economic theory, people value life more and more as they grow richer. This is because of the diminishing marginal returns of consumption. As you grow richer, using an extra dollar to purchase more consumption goods gives you less and less additional utility; meanwhile, as your life becomes better and better, you stand to lose more and more if you die. As a result, the richer people are, the greater the fraction of their income they are willing to sacrifice to protect their lives.</p>
<p>Comparing the current pandemic to the 1918 pandemic illustrates this phenomenon. Today, we are putting much of life on hold to minimize deaths. By contrast, in 1918, nonpharmaceutical interventions were milder and went on only <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27049#fromrss">for a month on average</a> in the U.S., even though the Spanish Flu was arguably deadlier and claimed younger victims. We are willing to sacrifice much more today than a hundred years ago to prevent deaths because we are richer and thus value life much more.</p>
<p>What does this mean for our model? Initially, a poor society will start out by allocating nearly all of its resources to consumption. And so as the economy grows, so does risk.</p>
<p>However, as people grow richer, they start valuing life more. They start investing in safety to mitigate risk, shifting more and more resources from consumption to safety. At this point, as the economy grows, risk begins to fall.</p>
<p>The risk of a existential catastrophe then looks like an inverted U-shape over time:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.23.53-300x191.png" alt="" width="666" height="424" srcset="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.23.53-300x191.png 300w, https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.23.53.png 628w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p>The dot represents where we might be right now. Over the past centuries, as we have grown out of poverty, we have overwhelmingly focused on consumption. As a result, risk is growing.</p>
<p>But as we are growing richer, we are beginning to value life more, and are slowly investing more in safety. Eventually, we will have shifted enough resources to safety such that risk begins to fall—fall exponentially to zero, in fact, such that there is a positive probability of humanity surviving to reach a grand future. And all of this occurs despite our society’s impatience.</p>
<p>There is an analog to this in environmental economics, called the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve#Environmental_Kuznets_curve">environmental Kuznets curve</a>.” It was theorized that pollution initially rises as countries develop, but, as people grow richer and begin to value a clean environment more, they will work to reduce pollution again. That theory has arguably been vindicated by the path that Western countries have taken with regard to water and air pollution, for example, over the past century.</p>
<p>The idea that we are in a unique time in history in which we are facing an elevated risk of existential catastrophe is not new either. Carl Sagan was the one who coined the term “time of perils.” Derek Parfit called it the “hinge of history.” They <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5506078de4b02d88372eee4e/t/5f36b015d9a3691ba8e1096b/1597419543571/Are+we+living+at+the+hinge+of+history.pdf">argue</a> that the discoveries of the last centuries have granted humanity immense power, and so we are in a most “dangerous and decisive” period. But if we manage to survive, our descendants will be able to spread throughout the galaxy, making us much less vulnerable. They will have mastered new technologies that make us immune to bioengineered pathogens, neutralize the threat from atomic bombs, provide plentiful energy without destroying the environment, and keep artificial intelligence in check so it faithfully serves human needs. With their technology and wisdom, our descendants will be able to secure a long and safe future. Our challenge, then, is to make it through this unique perilous period.</p>
<p>Seeing the rising levels of existential risk over the past centuries, some might call for an end to economic growth. They might argue, rightfully so, that economic growth has only led to rising risk in the past.</p>
<p>Indeed, a period of accelerated economic growth would initially also accelerate the rise in risk. The level of risk might look something like this, where the lighter line is the path with accelerated growth:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.42-300x201.png" alt="" width="666" height="446" srcset="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.42-300x201.png 300w, https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.42.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p>Even a few hundred years later, the critics of growth would seem to be vindicated! Faster growth just increased the risk!</p>
<p>Except that they are missing the whole picture:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.29-300x187.png" alt="" width="666" height="415" srcset="https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.29-300x187.png 300w, https://worksinprogress.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-19-at-23.24.29.png 666w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<p>The accelerated economic growth also accelerated our path along the inverted-U shape of risk. Faster growth means people are richer sooner, so they value life more sooner, so society shifts resources to safety sooner—and ultimately we will begin the decline in risk sooner. As a result, the overall probability of an existential catastrophe—the area under the risk curve—declines!</p>
<p>Faster growth means we get through the “time of perils” more quickly. Indeed, stagnation would be the most dangerous choice of all: we would be stuck at an elevated level of risk, …</p></div></div></div>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf">Generative adversarial network</a> (GAN) has shown great results in many generative tasks to replicate the real-world rich content such as images, human language, and music. It is inspired by game theory: two models, a generator and a critic, are competing with each other while making each other stronger at the same time. However, it is rather challenging to train a GAN model, as people are facing issues like training instability or failure to converge.</p>

<p>Here I would like to explain the maths behind the generative adversarial network framework,  why it is hard to be trained, and finally introduce a modified version of GAN intended to solve the training difficulties.</p>



<h2 id="kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">Kullback–Leibler and Jensen–Shannon Divergence</h2>

<p>Before we start examining GANs closely, let us first review two metrics for quantifying the similarity between two probability distributions.</p>

<p>(1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">KL (Kullback–Leibler) divergence</a> measures how one probability distribution \(p\) diverges from a second expected probability distribution \(q\).</p><p>

\[D_{KL}(p \| q) = \int_x p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} dx\]

</p><p>\(D_{KL}\) achieves the minimum zero when \(p(x)\) == \(q(x)\) everywhere.</p>

<p>It is noticeable according to the formula that KL divergence is asymmetric. In cases where \(p(x)\) is close to zero, but \(q(x)\) is significantly non-zero, the \(q\)’s effect is disregarded. It could cause buggy results when we just want to measure the similarity between two equally important distributions.</p>

<p>(2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence">Jensen–Shannon Divergence</a> is another measure of similarity between two probability distributions, bounded by \([0, 1]\). JS divergence is symmetric (yay!) and more smooth. Check this <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Jensen-Shannon-divergence-used-more-often-than-the-Kullback-Leibler-since-JS-is-symmetric-thus-possibly-a-better-indicator-of-distance">Quora post</a> if you are interested in reading more about the comparison between KL divergence and JS divergence.</p><p>

\[D_{JS}(p \| q) = \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p \| \frac{p + q}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(q \| \frac{p + q}{2})\]

<p><em>Fig. 1. Given two Gaussian distribution, \(p\) with mean=0 and std=1 and \(q\) with mean=1 and std=1. The average of two distributions is labelled as \(m=(p+q)/2\). KL divergence \(D_{KL}\) is asymmetric but JS divergence \(D_{JS}\) is symmetric.</em></p>

<p>Some believe (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05101.pdf">Huszar, 2015</a>) that one reason behind GANs’ big success is switching the loss function from asymmetric KL divergence in traditional maximum-likelihood approach to symmetric JS divergence. We will discuss more on this point in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="generative-adversarial-network-gan">Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</h2>

<p>GAN consists of two models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A discriminator \(D\) estimates the probability of a given sample coming from the real dataset. It works as a critic and is optimized to tell the fake samples from the real ones.</li>
  <li>A generator \(G\) outputs synthetic samples given a noise variable input \(z\) (\(z\) brings in potential output diversity). It is trained to capture the real data distribution so that its generative samples can be as real as possible, or in other words, can trick the discriminator to offer a high probability.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two models compete against each other during the training process: the generator \(G\) is trying hard to trick the discriminator, while the critic model \(D\) is trying hard not to be cheated. This interesting zero-sum game between two models motivates both to improve their functionalities.</p>

<p>Given,</p>

</table>

<p>On one hand, we want to make sure the discriminator \(D\)’s decisions over real data are accurate by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\). Meanwhile, given a fake sample \(G(z), z \sim p_z(z)\), the discriminator is expected to output a probability, \(D(G(z))\), close to zero by maximizing \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the generator is trained to increase the chances of \(D\) producing a high probability for a fake example, thus to minimize \(\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)} [\log (1 - D(G(z)))]\).</p>

<p>When combining both aspects together, \(D\) and \(G\) are playing a <strong>minimax game</strong> in which we should optimize the following loss function:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\min_G \max_D L(D, G) 
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)} [\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \\
&amp; = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_g(x)} [\log(1 - D(x)]
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>(\(\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{r}(x)} [\log D(x)]\) has no impact on \(G\) during gradient descent updates.)</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-optimal-value-for-d">What is the optimal value for D?</h3>

<p>Now we have a well-defined loss function. Let’s first examine what is the best value for \(D\).</p><p>

\[L(G, D) = \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D(x)) \bigg) dx\]

</p><p>Since we are interested in what is the best value of \(D(x)\) to maximize \(L(G, D)\), let us label</p><p>

\[\tilde{x} = D(x), 
A=p_{r}(x), 
B=p_g(x)\]

</p><p>And then what is inside the integral (we can safely ignore the integral because \(x\) is sampled over all the possible values) is:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
f(\tilde{x}) 
&amp; = A log\tilde{x} + B log(1-\tilde{x}) \\

\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}}
&amp; = A \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{\tilde{x}} - B \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{1}{1 - \tilde{x}} \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} (\frac{A}{\tilde{x}} - \frac{B}{1-\tilde{x}}) \\
&amp; = \frac{1}{ln10} \frac{A - (A + B)\tilde{x}}{\tilde{x} (1 - \tilde{x})} \\
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus, set \(\frac{d f(\tilde{x})}{d \tilde{x}} = 0\), we get the best value of the discriminator: \(D^*(x) = \tilde{x}^* = \frac{A}{A + B} = \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r}(x) + p_g(x)} \in [0, 1]\).</p>

<p>Once the generator is trained to its optimal, \(p_g\) gets very close to \(p_{r}\). When \(p_g = p_{r}\), \(D^*(x)\) becomes \(1/2\).</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-global-optimal">What is the global optimal?</h3>

<p>When both \(G\) and \(D\) are at their optimal values, we have \(p_g = p_{r}\) and \(D^*(x) = 1/2\) and the loss function becomes:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
L(G, D^*) 
&amp;= \int_x \bigg( p_{r}(x) \log(D^*(x)) + p_g (x) \log(1 - D^*(x)) \bigg) dx \\
&amp;= \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_{r}(x) dx + \log \frac{1}{2} \int_x p_g(x) dx \\
&amp;= -2\log2
\end{aligned}\]

</p><h3 id="what-does-the-loss-function-represent">What does the loss function represent?</h3>

<p>According to the formula listed in the <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/08/20/from-GAN-to-WGAN.html#kullbackleibler-and-jensenshannon-divergence">previous section</a>, JS divergence between \(p_{r}\) and \(p_g\) can be computed as:</p><p>

\[\begin{aligned}
D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) 
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{r} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) + \frac{1}{2} D_{KL}(p_{g} || \frac{p_{r} + p_g}{2}) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_{r}(x) \log \frac{p_{r}(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) + \\&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log2 + \int_x p_g(x) \log \frac{p_g(x)}{p_{r} + p_g(x)} dx \bigg) \\
=&amp; \frac{1}{2} \bigg( \log4 + L(G, D^*) \bigg)
\end{aligned}\]

</p><p>Thus,</p><p>

\[L(G, D^*) = 2D_{JS}(p_{r} \| p_g) - 2\log2\]

</p><p>Essentially the loss function of GAN quantifies the similarity between the generative data distribution \(p_g\) and the real sample distribution \(p_{r}\) by JS divergence when the discriminator is optimal. The best \(G^*\) that replicates the real data distribution leads to the minimum \(L(G^*, D^*) = -2\log2\) which is aligned with equations above.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Other Variations of GAN</strong>: There are many variations of GANs in different contexts or designed for different tasks. For example, for semi-supervised learning, one idea is to update the discriminator to output real class labels, \(1, \dots, K-1\), as well as one fake class label \(K\). The generator model aims to trick the discriminator to output a classification label smaller than \(K\).</p>

<h2 id="problems-in-gans">Problems in GANs</h2>

<p>Although GAN has shown great success in the realistic image generation, the training is not easy; The process is known to be slow and unstable.</p>

<h3 id="hard-to-achieve-nash-equilibrium">Hard to achieve Nash equilibrium</h3>

<p><a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6125-improved-techniques-for-training-gans.pdf">Salimans et al. (2016)</a> discussed the problem with GAN’s gradient-descent-based training procedure. Two models are trained simultaneously to find a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> to a two-player non-cooperative game. However, each model updates its cost independently with no respect to another player in the game. Updating the gradient of both models concurrently cannot guarantee a convergence.</p>

<p>Let’s check out a simple example to better understand why it is difficult to find a Nash equilibrium in an non-cooperative game. Suppose one player takes control of \(x\) to minimize \(f_1(x) = xy\), while at the same time the other player constantly updates \(y\) to minimize \(f_2(y) = -xy\).</p>

<p>Because \(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} = y\) and \(\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} = -x\), we update \(x\) with \(x-\eta \cdot y\) and \(y\) with \(y+ \eta \cdot x\) simulitanously in one iteration, where \(\eta\) is the learning rate. Once \(x\) and \(y\) have different signs, every following gradient update causes huge oscillation and the instability gets worse in time, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<p><img src="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/assets/images/nash_equilibrium.png" alt="Nash equilibrium example"></p>
<p><em>Fig. 3. A simulation of our example for updating \(x\) to minimize \(xy\) and updating \(y\) to minimize \(-xy\). The learning rate \(\eta = 0.1\). With more iterations, the oscillation grows more and more unstable.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n the mid-2020â€™s, NASA will launch a helicopter-like lander the size of a small car toward Titan, Saturnâ€™s largest moon. Nearly a decade later, after crossing about a billion miles of empty darkness, this spacecraft, dubbed Dragonfly, will gently settle onto Titanâ€™s sand dunes.&nbsp;There&nbsp;the sun will merely appear as a very bright star in the heavens and the Earth will barely be visible, like a floating mote of dust. The frigid temperatures will be colder than anywhere on Earth. But scientists believe this enigmatic world might harbor alien life.<br></p>

<p>Of all the planets, moons and asteroids in our solar system, Titan is a rarity. Along with Enceladus, another of Saturnâ€™s moons, and Europa, which orbits Jupiter, it is an ocean world, possessing flowing water and other liquids, organic materials, and an energy source that could provide just the right conditions for microbes to arise. Mars might be synonymous with pop-culture conceptions of aliens, but the Red Planet likely lacks those features and has been bone-dry and mostly atmosphere-less for some three billion years. These ocean worlds could be inhabited right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discovery of any kind of alien microbes on any of these worlds would be transformative, changing our prevailing views of life, its origins, and ultimately, ourselves. But if searches for life continue to turn up nothing, it may turn out that Earthlings have to explore much, much further to find fellow organisms in our galaxy.</p>
<p>â€œThese three moons in particular can help us test the hypothesis of whether life can naturally evolve in a place if you have all the ingredients it needs to survive,â€� says Morgan Cable, an astrochemist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and part of a cadre of astronomers who want to send robotic explorers to these moons. â€œOr is life super unique and weâ€™re horribly alone?â€�</p>
<p>Along with Dragonfly, NASA is also building the Europa Clipper, a lander slated to sail toward Jupiter's moon in the near future. And though a return to Enceladus is not high on the agencyâ€™s priorities, a collaboration with the Breakthrough Starshot Foundation could eventually get a mission off the ground. Titan will come first, though, making it the first ocean world—other than Earth, of course—to be explored.</p>
<blockquote>Titan will be the first ocean world<strong>—</strong>other than Earth<strong>—</strong>to be explored.</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes visible to the naked eye with its faint yellowish hue, Saturn has fascinated Persian, Hindu, Chinese, Greek and other stargazers for millennia. But it was Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan orbiting the sixth planet in 1655 using a telescope he built himself. Soon afterward, he discerned Saturnâ€™s rings and also spotted a clutch of its smaller moons, of which there are now known to be more than fifty. Huygens referred to the largest moon as Luna Saturni, and English astronomer John Herschel later gave it and other known moons names from Greek mythology. Those monikers stuck.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, data collected by the first Voyager probe during its brief, 37,000 mile-per-hour flyby revealed how surprisingly thick and opaque Titanâ€™s atmosphere is. Later came NASAâ€™s Cassini spacecraft, laden with sensitive instrumentation, which surveyed the ocean worlds and other moons until spectacularly ending its mission in 2017 by diving into Saturnâ€™s gaseous body. Before Cassini burned up, the data it sent back to Earth finally penetrated Titanâ€™s haze to map out its undulating plains, dunes, lakes, and craters.</p>
<p>Larger than our moon and even Mercury, which is roughly two-fifths the size of Earth, Titan hosts plenty of intriguingly unique environments. Nascent lifeforms might benefit from its bubbling ice volcanoes, with the heat and pressure from below thrusting up liquified, briny ice like flowing, molten rock on Earth. And Titan is occasionally bombarded by asteroids whose impacts could melt the ice frozen on its surface. But after a time the water they produce—and anything possibly living there—would inevitably freeze again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_32ad92099390210393fe7b2b51e82e8a.jpg" alt="Titan surface - artist rendering"><figcaption><span>Artistâ€™s visualization of hydrocarbon pools on Titan's rocky surface. </span><br><span>Steven Hobbs</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Titanâ€™s dense, calm, orange-tinted atmosphere stands out, too, as an uncommon feature of worlds in our solar system. â€œThe reason weâ€™re interested in life on Titan is because of its atmosphere,â€� says Catherine Neish, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. Nitrogen and other molecules undergo reactions with ultraviolet light from the sun and cosmic rays, which turns them into more complex molecules. â€œAt the end of the day,â€� says Neish, â€œyou have these hugely complicated organic molecules that slowly trickle down to the surface, meaning that the Titan surface is covered in them.â€�<br></p>
<p>The chemical conditions on the surface could pose an obstacle to possible fledgling microbes—provided theyâ€™re like anything scientists know on Earth. But scientists have also speculated about life as we <em>donâ€™t</em> know it. Clouds of methane and ethane drift over Titan; they rain onto its surface, forming rivers and streams that ooze into polar seas comparable in size to the Great Lakes on Earth. Itâ€™s the only world in the solar system other than Earth known to have vast quantities of liquid on its surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquids are a superb medium for bringing molecules together, forming new ones, and sweeping away waste. Eventually, somewhere, molecules can become more complex and make new copies of themselves, crossing the blurry boundary that some scientists and philosophers would call â€œlife.â€� The methane lakes of Titan would offer very different building blocks than do Earthâ€™s pools; microbes would have to eat acetylene and breathe hydrogen rather than oxygen, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alien life forms would also need to cope with temperatures down to âˆ’180 degrees Celsius—roughly twice as cold as the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth—and with methane being a poor medium for carbon-based organic molecules to dissolve in. That would limit the chemical possibilities, making it harder to break most chemical bonds, and crucially, it would result in slower chemical reactions. If microbes defied the odds and arose on the surface, then, their life cycle and ecological interactions would move very slowly compared to the processes thought to be involved in the beginnings of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists are keeping an open mind about lifeâ€™s myriad forms, including a chemistry alien to us, so they equip their probes with a variety of instruments and make their explorations as thorough as possible. But it's hard to look for something you've never seen before. â€œIt may be that life in a lake like that is very, very different and potentially unrecognizable compared to life as we know,â€� says Cable. â€œWe donâ€™t want to miss it by accident because weâ€™re biased by Earth life.â€�</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_13df004fcabca482b041f97e46687a81.jpg" alt="High-Temperature-Beebe-Vents-Black-Smokers"><figcaption><span>A hydrothermal vent in the Cayman Trough, three miles below sea level, may be similar to vents on Enceladus. </span><br><span>Chris German/WHOI/NSF</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>M</span>ethane lakes are not the only potential cradle for Titanian life. Titan, as well as Europa and Enceladus, have relatively warm oceans underground. Titanâ€™s salty waters are hidden beneath an icy crust 100 kilometers thick, blocking already-feeble light from the distant sun, so photosynthesis would be impossible. But it is possible that on some of the ocean worlds, alien microbes could instead glean energy from hydrothermal—hot water—vents found near volcanoes rising from the bottom of these vast oceans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Earth, the movement of tectonic plates cracks the planetâ€™s rocky crust and creates such fissures. On the ocean worlds, the necessary force is provided by the constant gravitational pull of close orbits around the colossi of Saturn and Jupiter. Water percolating into cracking rock can then release energy.</p>
<p>â€œThe great thing about hydrothermal vents is that they provide a lot of energy sources for microbial life that doesnâ€™t include sunlight,â€� says Julie Huber, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Organisms living at hydrothermal vents on Earthâ€™s seafloors, she explains, â€œcan use chemical energy, so that means things like sulphur, iron, hydrogen and methane and they create a base of the food chain.â€�</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, oceanographers towing cameras on miles-long cables through the GalÃ¡pagos Rift in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, near the islands of the same name, collected the first clear evidence of hydrothermal vents. Theyâ€™ve subsequently been found scattered in seafloor volcanic areas near the edges of tectonic plates throughout the worldâ€™s ocean, spewing superheated, mineral-rich fluids that generate chemical reactions as they burble into the cold seawater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might seem challenging for anything to subsist in these harsh, bleak places. In fact, such environments typically offer wide ranges of temperature, pressure, acidity and energy, meaning that a diversity of microbial life is actually possible. Itâ€™s been theorized that life on Earth actually originated around hydrothermal vents rather than in primordial soup at the planet's surface, and some hardy organisms thrive there: mainly specially adapted bacteria and single-celled creatures known as archaea. Even in the ostensibly deadest spot on Earth, the nutrient-starved South Pacific Gyre east of Australia, scientists recently found microbes that apparently survived for millions of years in a form of stasis while embedded in the seafloor.</p>
<p>Vent fields off Costa Rica and in the Caribbeanâ€™s deep Cayman Trough are thought to be similar an undersea spot on Enceladus, and the connection between hydrothermal vents on Earth and potentially similar spots on ocean worlds has spurred collaborations between astrobiologists and oceanographers like Huber. The nascent deep-sea mining industry is interested, too, though for different reasons: the mineral-rich sulfide deposits include some valuable metals in dwindling supply on land, like manganese, copper, nickel and …</p></article></div>

  <p>Previously I’ve decided to implement a rather basic <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/">raycasting engine in ClojureScript</a>.
It was a lot of fun, an interesting experience, and ClojureScript was awesome.
I’ve implemented small <a href="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/posts/2020-06-04-simple-ray-casting-with-clojurescript/#labyrinth-game">labyrinth game</a>, and thought about adding more features to the engine, such as camera shake, and wall height change.
But when I’ve started working on these, I quickly understood, that I’d like to move on to something more interesting, like real 3D rendering engine, that also uses rays.</p>
<p>Obviously, my first though was about writing a ray-tracer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This technique is wide known, and gained a lot of traction recently.
With native hardware support for ray tracing, a lot of games are using it, and there are a lot of tutorials teaching how to implement one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
In short, we cast a bunch of rays in 3D space, and calculate their trajectories, looking for what ray will hit and bounce off.
Different materials have different bounce properties, and by tracing rays from camera to the source of light, we can imitate illumination.
There are also a lot of different approaches how to calculate bouncing, e.g. for global illumination, and ambient light, but I’ve felt that it is a rather complicated task, for a weekend post.
And unlike raycasting, most ray-tracers require polygonal information in order to work, where raycasting only need to know wall start and end points.</p>
<p>I’ve wanted a similar approach for 3D rendering, where we specify an object in terms of it’s mathematical representation.
Like for sphere, we’ll just specify coordinate of a center, and a radius, and our rays will find intersection points with it, providing us a sufficient data to draw this sphere on screen.
And recently, I’ve read about a similar technique, that uses rays for drawing on screen, but instead of casting infinite rays as in raycasting, it marches a ray in terms of steps.
And it also uses a special trick, to make this process very optimized, therefore we can use it for rendering real 3D objects.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to structure this post similarly to the one about raycasting, so this will be another long-read, often more about Fennel rather than raymarching, but at the end I promise that we’ll get something that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/end-result.png"> 
</figure>

<p>So, just as in raycasting, first we need to do is to understand how raymarching engine works <em>on paper</em>.</p>
<h2 id="raymarching-basics">Raymarching basics</h2>
<p>Raymarching can be illustrated similarly to raycaster, except it requires more steps until we could render our image.
First, we need a camera, and an object to look at:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Our first step would to cast a ray, however, unlike with raycasting, we’ll cast a portion of a ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-short-ray.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We then check, if the ray intersects with the sphere.
It’s not, so we do one more step:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-two-steps.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>It’s not intersecting yet, so we repeat again:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-ray-overshoot.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Oops, ray overshoot, and is now inside the sphere.
This is not really good option for us, as we want for our rays to end directly at the object’s surface, without calculating intersection point with the object itself.
We can fix this by casting shorter ray:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/camera-and-circle-small-rays.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>However, this is very inefficient!
And besides, if we’ll change the angle a bit or move the camera, we will overshoot again.
Which means that we’ll either have incorrect result, or require a very small step size, which will blow up computation process.
How we can fix this?</p>
<h3 id="distance-estimation">Distance estimation</h3>
<p>The solution to this is a signed distance function, or a so called Distance Estimator.
Imagine if we knew how far we are from the object at any point of time?
This would mean that we can shoot a ray of this length in any direction and still don’t hit anything.
Let’s add another object to the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/scene-with-two-objects.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s draw two circles, which will represent distances from the objects, to the point from where we’ll cast rays:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/distances.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that there are two circles, and one is bigger than another.
This means, that if we choose the shortest safe distance, we can safely cast ray in any direction and not overshoot anything.
For example, let’s cast a ray towards the square:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/ray-in-safe-zone.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We can see, that we haven’t reached the square, but more importantly we did not overshoot it.
Now we need to march the ray again, but what distance should it cover?
To answer this question, we need to take another distance estimation from ray end to the objects in the scene:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/second-safe-march.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>Once again we choose shorter distance, and march towards the square, then get the distance again, and repeat the whole process:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/another-safe-match.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>You can see that with each step the distance to the object becomes smaller, and thus we will never overshoot the object.
However this also means, that we will take a lot of really small steps, until we finally fully hit the object, if we ever do.
This is not a good idea, because it is even more inefficient than using fixed distance, and produces too accurate results, which we don’t really need.
So instead of marching up until we exactly hit the object, we will march <em>enough</em> times.
E.g. until the distance to the object is small enough, then there’s no real point to continue marching, as it is clear that we will hit the object soon.
But this also means, that if the ray goes near the edge of an object, we do a lot of expensive steps of computing distance estimations.</p>
<p>Here’s a ray that is parallel to the side of the square, and marches towards the circle:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/expensive-marching.svg"> 
</figure>

<p>We do a lot of seemingly pointless measurements, and if a ray was closer to the square’s side, we would do even more steps.
However this also means, that we can use this data (since we’re already computed it) to render such things as glow, or ambient occlusion.
But more on this later.</p>
<p>Once ray hit an object we have all the data we need.
Ray represents a point on the screen, and the more rays we cast the higher resolution of our image will be.
And since we’re not using triangles to represent objects, our spheres will always be smooth, no matter how close we are to it, because there’s no polygons involved.</p>
<p>This is basically it.
Ray marching is quite simple concept, just like raycaster, although it’s a bit more complicated, as we do have to compute things in 3D space now.
So let’s begin implementing it by installing required tools, and setting up the project.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
<p>As you know from the title we will use two main tools to create ray-marcher, which are <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>, a free game engine, and <a href="https://fennel-lang.org/">Fennel</a> the programming language.
I’ve chosen Fennel, because it is a Lisp like language, that compiles to Lua, and I’m quite a fan of Lisps.
But we also needed to draw somewhere, and I know no GUI toolkit for Lua.
But there is LÖVE - a game engine that runs Lua code, which is capable on running on all systems, thus a perfect candidate for our task.</p>
<p>Installation steps may differ per operating system, so please refer to manuals<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
At the time of writing this post I’m using Fedora GNU/Linux, so for me it means:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ sudo dnf install love luarocks readline-devel
$ luarocks install --local fennel
$ luarocks install --local readline <span># requires readline-devel</span>
$ <span>export</span> <span>PATH</span>=<span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.luarocks/bin"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>It’s better to permanently add <code>$HOME/luarocks/bin</code> (or another path, if your installation differs) to the <code>PATH</code> variable in your shell, in order to be able to use installed utilities without specifying full path every time.
You can test if everything is installed correctly, by running <code>fennel</code> in you command line.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ fennel
Welcome to Fennel 0.5.0 on Lua 5.3!
Use (doc something) to view documentation.
&gt;&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
&gt;&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>For other distributions installation steps may vary, and for Windows, I think it’s safe to skip the <code>readline</code> part, which is fully optional, but makes editing in a REPL a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>Once everything is installed, let’s create the project directory, and the <code>main.fnl</code> file, where we will write our code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">$ mkdir love_raymarching
$ <span>cd</span> love_raymarching
$ touch main.fnl
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it!
We can test if everything works by adding this code to <code>main.fnl</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>fn </span><span>love.draw</span> []
  (<span>love.graphics.print</span> <span>"It works!"</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Now we can compile it with <code>fennel --compile main.fnl &gt; main.lua</code>, thus producing the <code>main.lua</code> file, and run <code>love .</code> (dot is intentional, it indicates current directory).</p>
<p>A window should appear, with white text <code>It works!</code> in upper left corner:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://andreyorst.gitlab.io/2020-10-15-raymarching-with-lua-and-love/love-works.png"> 
</figure>

<p>Now we can begin implementing our raymarcher.</p>
<h2 id="scene-setup">Scene setup</h2>
<p>Just as in raycaster, we need a camera that will shoot rays, and some objects to look at.
Let’s begin by creating a camera object, that will store coordinates and rotation information.
We can do so, by using <code>var</code> to declare a variable that is local to our file, and that we can later change with <code>set</code><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>var </span><span>camera</span> {<span>:pos</span> [0.0 0.0 0.0]
             <span>:x-rotate</span> 0.0
             <span>:z-rotate</span> 0.0})
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Lisps, and especially Clojure, let me quickly explain what this syntax is.
If you know this stuff, feel free to <a href="#org6f2d291">skip this part</a>.</p>
<p>We start by using a <code>var</code> special form, that binds a value to a name like this: <code>(var name value)</code>.
So if we start the REPL, using <code>fennel</code> command in the shell, and write <code>(var a 40)</code>, a new variable <code>a</code> will be created.
We then can check, that it has the desired value by typing <code>a</code>, and pressing return:</p>
<p>We can then alter the contents of this variable by using <code>set</code> special form, which works like this <code>(set name new-value)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>set </span><span>a</span> (<span>+ </span><span>a</span> 2))
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>a</span>
42
</code></pre></div><p>Now to curly and square brackets.
Everything enclosed in curly braces is a hashmap.
We can use any Lua value as our key, and the most common choice is a string, but Fennel has additional syntax for defining keys - a colon followed by a word: <code>:a</code>.
This is called a keyword, and in Fennel it is essentially the same as <code>"a"</code>, but we don’t need to write a pair of quotes.
However keywords can’t contain spaces, and some other symbols.</p>
<p>So writing this <code>{:a 0 :b 2 :c :hello}</code> in the REPL will make a new table, that holds three key value pairs, which we can later get with another syntax - the dot <code>.</code>.
Combining it with <code>var</code>, we can see that it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>var </span><span>m</span> {<span>:a</span> 1 <span>:b</span> 2 <span>:c</span> <span>:hello</span>})
<span>&gt;&gt;</span> (<span>. </span><span>m</span> <span>:b</span>)
2
</code></pre></div><p>There’s also a shorthand for this …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<p><em>This article is based on a book chapter from my upcoming book <strong>“From One to Zero: A Minimalistic Approach to Programming”</strong>. </em></p>



<p>My <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/subscribe/" title="Subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">programming students</a> often write in with their struggles and failures. Many students ultimately overcome their struggles—but a large percentage of them <strong><em>give up their programming ambitions</em></strong> after realizing how hard creating software can be. These students started with the goal of becoming professional coders, but, ultimately, they missed that target. </p>



<p>After thousands of personal conversations with these students, it became apparent that many new coders don’t fail because they don’t know one or the other Python feature or because they lack technical skills, intelligence, or even talent. </p>



<p>These are not the underlying reasons <strong><em>why </em></strong>they fail. </p>



<p>Instead, they fail because they are<strong> overwhelmed by the complexity lurking everywhere in programming</strong>. The complexity causes them to throw in the towel. This is unfortunate because there are many ways to mitigate the harmful effects of complexity in programming. In the previous chapter, you’ve already learned some strategies about the <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/the-80-20-principle-in-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="The 80/20 Principle in Programming"><strong>80/20 principle</strong></a> (Focus on the vital few and sacrifice the trivial many!).</p>



<p>In this chapter, we’re going to have a comprehensive look at this important and highly underexplored topic. <strong>What exactly is complexity?</strong> Where does it occur? How does it look like?</p>



<p>Let’s start with a quick overview—there’s significant complexity in selecting the right</p>



<ul><li>programming language among dozens of popular languages,</li><li>coding project to work on—from thousands of open-source projects and myriads of problems,</li><li>libraries within a language (<a href="https://blog.finxter.com/why-does-the-scikit-learn-library-use-a-trailing-underscore-convention-for-attribute-names/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Why Does the Scikit-learn Library use a Trailing Underscore Convention for Attribute Names?">scikit-learn</a> vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/numpy-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="NumPy Tutorial – Everything You Need to Know to Get Started">NumPy </a>vs <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/2-min-computer-science-papers-tensorflow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[2-min CS Papers] A Short Introduction to the TensorFlow System">TensorFlow</a>),</li><li>emerging technologies to “bet on”—Alexa apps, smartphone apps, browser-based web apps, integrated Facebook or WeChat apps, virtual reality apps—and</li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">coding editor</a> such as PyCharm, IDLE, and Atom.</li></ul>



<p>Given the great confusion caused by these sources of complexity, it’s no surprise that<strong><em> “How to start?”</em></strong> is one of the most common questions from programming beginners. </p>



<p>To answer the question right away, the best way to start is <strong><em>not </em></strong>by choosing a programming book and reading over all <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/python-crash-course/" title="Python Programming Tutorial [+Cheat Sheets]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">syntactical features</a> of the programming language. Surprisingly, these coding books sell well—even I am a<a href="https://coffeebreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://coffeebreakpython.com/"> seller of such books</a>. However, interacting with thousands of programming students personally I realized that many ambitious students buy programming books as a commitment device to put the learning task on their ToDo lists—if they’ve spent money on the book, they better read it or the investment will be lost. But as so many other tasks on their ToDo lists, reading a programming book is seldomly one to be completed. </p>



<p><strong>Many students buy these programming tutorial books but very few actually read them.</strong></p>



<p>So, what is the <strong><em>best way to start to learn to program</em></strong>? In my opinion, the best way to start is to choose a practical code project—a simple one if you’re a beginner—and push it to completion. </p>



<ul><li>Don’t read coding books before you do this. </li><li>Don’t read random tutorials on the web. </li><li>Don’t scroll through endless feeds on StackOverflow. </li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Just set up the project and start coding with the limited skills you have</em></strong> and your common sense. </p>



<p>It’s okay if you don’t understand what you’re doing, you will gradually increase your understanding. You read books and articles only to make progress on the project in front of you. By diving into the process of finishing your first project, you need to solve a number of highly relevant problems: </p>



<ul><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/best-python-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="Best Python IDE and Code Editors [Ultimate Guide]">Which code editor should you use? </a></li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/install-python-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="How to Install Python on Windows? [7 Easy Steps]">How to install Python? </a></li><li><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-read-all-lines-of-a-file-in-a-python-one-liner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="How to Read All Lines of a File in a Python One-Liner?">How to read input from a file? </a></li><li>How to store the input in your program for later use? </li><li>How to manipulate the input to obtain the desired output?</li></ul>



<p>By answering these questions, you gradually build a well-rounded skill set of a practitioner. Over time, you’ll answer these questions better and better. Your speed and skill to solve these problems will grow. You’ll be able to solve similar problems much bigger and you’ll create your internal database of programming patterns and conceptual insights. Even advanced coders learn and improve with the exact same process—only the coding projects have become much larger and more complicated.</p>



<p>Let’s assume you adopt this <a href="https://blog.finxter.com/how-to-start-your-freelancing-business-on-the-side/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="[7 Steps] How to Start Your Freelancing Business on the Side?">project-based learning approach</a>. You focus on a single project and work on it for a considerable amount of time. What is your biggest enemy now? You guessed it: <strong><em>complexity</em></strong>.</p>



<p>You’ll struggle with complexity in:</p>



<ul><li>finding bugs in ever-growing codebases,</li><li>understanding code components and how they interact,</li><li>choosing the right feature to be implemented next,</li><li>understanding the mathematical and conceptual basics of the code.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Complexity is everywhere</strong>, at every stage of a project that comes to life. And the hidden costs of this complexity are very tangible: coders who are just starting out throw in the towel and the projects never see the light of day. The beginner argues: <em>“coding is too difficult for me”</em> and he truly believes it—even though nothing can be further from the truth.</p>



<p>The root of the problem is overwhelming complexity and a lack of focus. So, the question arises: </p>



<p><strong><em>How to solve complexity and a lack of focus?</em></strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/509922/pexels-photo-509922.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Minimalism" width="844" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>The answer is straightforward, and I’ve already stressed it a few times in this book: <strong>minimalism</strong>. Seek simplicity and focus – in every stage of the coding cycle. I want you to take this one concept out of the book: Take a radically minimalistic position in every area you’ll encounter in the programming space. If this book can convince you to take more extreme measures to increase your focus, it has accomplished its mission!</p>



<p>Let’s dive deeper into the concept of complexity to develop an understanding of one of the great enemies of your coding productivity.</p>




<h2><span id="What_is_Complexity"></span>What is Complexity?<span></span></h2>



<p>In different fields, the term complexity comes with different meanings. Sometimes, it’s strictly defined, such as in computational complexity of a computer program that provides a means to analyze a given code function for varying inputs. Other times, it’s loosely defined as the amount or structure of interactions between system components. But in this book, we’re going to use it in a more generic way.</p>



<p>The Merriam Webster dictionary defines complexity as <em>“something complex”</em>. The term complex is defined as <em>“a whole made up of complicated […] parts”</em>. If you resolve the term complicated—<em>“difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>—you end up with the following rough definition:</p>



<p><strong>Complexity</strong>: <em>“a whole, made up of parts, that is difficult to analyze, understand, or explain”</em>.</p>



<p>This is how we use the term complexity in this book. Complexity describes a whole system or entity. It is difficult to explain or describe. Because of its difficulty, complexity causes struggle and confusion. When confronted with complexity, people find themselves cognitively unable to comprehend the deeper meaning, implications, or effects of “the whole”.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" data-src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4183195/pexels-photo-4183195.jpeg?auto=compress&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;h=750&amp;w=1260" alt="Complexity" width="450" height="563" data-old-src="//blog.finxter.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif"></figure></div>



<p>They cannot see the big picture—complexity is the enemy of clarity, closure, and predictability, because a complex system behaves in highly unpredictable ways. Where do you find complexity? You’ll find it everywhere, because real-world systems are messy: A highly interrelated web of causes and effects that obfuscates the behavior of a real system, and that is impossible to decode for individuals who are themselves caught in this complex web. Like a differential equation, the output of one system feeds into another system’s input which, in turn, feeds back into the first system as an input. Examples of highly complex systems are the stock market, social trends, emerging political viewpoints, and big computer programs with hundreds of thousands of lines of code—such as the Windows operating system.</p>



<p>If you are a coder, you are especially prone to overwhelming complexity. Let’s dive into different sources of complexity in the field of programming:</p>



<ul><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li><li>Complexity in Software and Algorithmic Theory</li><li>Complexity in Learning</li><li>Complexity in Processes</li><li>Complexity in Social Networks</li><li>Complexity in Your Daily Life</li><li>Complexity in a Project Lifecycle</li></ul>



<p>The best way to learn and create lasting value is through your participation or initiation of a real-world project. But how does it look like when a real-world project comes to life? Let’s dive into the different stages of the project lifecycle: Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, and Deployment (see Figure 1).</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the software development life cycle consisting of six phases. Even if you’re working on a very small software project, you’re likely going through all six phases of the software development lifecycle. Next, you’ll quickly dive into all six phases—and how complexity has a significant impact on every one of them.</p>



<h3><span id="Planning"></span>Planning<span></span></h3>



<p>The first stage of the software development life cycle is the planning phase. From software engineering literature, you may know this as <strong><em>requirement analysis</em></strong>. The purpose of this phase is to determine how the end product will look like. A successful planning phase leads to a strictly defined set of required features to deliver to the customer or the end user.</p>



<p>The planning phase solves a multi-dimensional problem where different departments and functions must collaborate to determine the optimal set of features of the software. A number of factors must be taken into consideration: the costs of building a feature, the risk of not being able to successfully implement the feature, the expected value for the end user, marketing and sales implications, maintainability, scalability, legal restrictions and many more.</p>



<p>This phase is crucial because it can save you from massive wastages of downstream energy in the following phases. Business owners know that <strong><em>capital allocation</em></strong> (or …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Pursuing a non-conventional path</h3><p>Between 2015 and 2020 I have participated in <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a> and <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> tournaments. Being involved in these tournaments has led me to a <strong>very profitable journey</strong>: I made around $350k during these years.</p><p>Many people have reached out to me and asked how I did it. I decided to write this post to inspire others with this <strong>non-conventional path</strong>.</p><h4>Selling a Trading Algorithm</h4><p>In 2015 <strong>algorithmic trading</strong> was one of my interests. This is how I came across <a href="https://quantopian.com/">Quantopian</a>, a platform that provides data and tools so anyone can develop and test trading algorithms. After learning the basics and playing around with the platform I decided to submit an algorithm to their recently created tournament.</p><p>The algorithm was pretty basic but surprisingly it remained in the <strong>top 10 for a few weeks</strong>. I received many messages: companies suggesting to join them as a Financial Quant, people interested in my approach, and a few offers from people interested in buying the algorithm.</p><p>One of those potential buyers was particularly interested, shockingly enough, even after I explained him how simple my algorithm was. I eventually shared the code with him for free. Still, he expressed his desire to send me the amount he offered in the first instance. And that's how I made <strong>the first $2k out of participating in ML/financial tournaments.</strong></p><h4>Getting The Dream Job</h4><p>During these weeks I exchanged many emails with Apple employees, financial quants, people from Europe, Asia, or America. But the best interaction came from a guy from my town. He was building his own trading algorithm and was interested in my approach. I meet him a couple of times. Obviously, his knowledge was years ahead of where I was at that time.</p><p>Those meetings were very productive, especially for me. After discussing with him about our personal and professional interests, and how difficult it was to find good jobs in our city, he introduced me to my next employer. Of course, I was not aware of it at that time. He introduced me to the CEO of an ad-tech company, and at first glance I saw many things in common between this sector and <strong>high-frequency trading</strong>. The offered position (not publicly opened at that time) would also allow me to face and try to solve many machine learning, big data and architectural challenges.</p><p>After a few weeks and a couple of meetings, I decided that the company was a really good fit, a place where I would continue professionally growing and developing as a <strong>data scientist and engineer</strong>.</p><p>During years we worked on building a solid <strong>platform that led us to be acquired in 2018</strong>. The experience was great and the outcome even better. Including the exit bonus I made a big sum during this period.</p><h4>The Altcoins Trading Madness</h4><figure><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5c9snCN/Cf-DCZLm-WEAACt-ZS.jpg" alt="Numerai Tournament Leaderboard"></figure><p>In 2016, I discovered the <a href="https://numer.ai/tournament">Numerai Tournament</a>, "the hardest data science tournament on the planet" as they claim. Numerai is a weekly global <strong>data science tournament</strong> to solve the stock market. Data scientists work with clean, regularized, and obfuscated datasets provided by Numerai to create machine-learning models to predict the stock market. <a href="https://numer.ai/">Numerai</a> builds a meta model of the most unique and contributive predictions, and uses this to command the capital in its global equity hedge fund.</p><p>In early 2016 I had finished a <strong>few rounds in good spots</strong>, as you can see in the image. After a few months of actively participating, I ended 2016 with around 0.5 BTC. It was cool but it required too much of my time. I had other priorities, so I withdrew the earnings and left the tournament.</p><p>Almost a year later a post about a Numerai airdrop came across my timeline. After login back to my account I discovered I received 1800 NMR.</p><p>At that time, the amount was valued around $30k, so I initially decided to withdraw almost everything, but something changed my mind and I started <strong>buying and selling altcoins</strong>. After some back and forth, and some lucky movements, I ended accumulating a wallet valued around $100k.</p><p>2017 was arriving at his end and I took <strong>the last lucky movement</strong>, I withdrew half of that sum a few weeks before the bitcoin crash. I still hold the other half but it wasn't easy to stick to that decision during 2018, while cryptos prices continued decreasing.</p><h4>The Compound Effect</h4><p>In July 2018, I came back to Numerai Tournament. I made some submissions but I didn't take it seriously again until mid-2019.</p><p>Since then I have a <strong>cumulative return of +141%</strong>. I have built an algorithm with an average weekly return of +2%, which taking into account the compounding effect it translates to <strong>+180% annualized total return</strong>.</p><h4>What's next?</h4><p>I'm going to continue participating in the Numerai Tournament, if everything continues as it is now, it would provide a good income without requiring much effort. I will also continue taking <strong>small bets</strong>, experimenting with other projects, continue doing things I like, and <strong>learning in the process</strong>.</p><p>I share similar histories in Twitter, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/jrdi">follow me there</a> as I continue to document my journey.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Monetizing Your Open Source Project]]>

<br/>
October 20, 2020 | https://blog.ueber.io/post/monetizing-open-source/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.ueber.io/post/monetizing-open-source/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We double down on our open source projects without knowing how we make money with it. Open source software is accessible for free, so how can we make it sustainable? Let’s look at what could work.</p>
<p>Too many open source projects die because developers burn out to deliver fantastic software in their free time. That’s not how it should be, so what’s the alternative? We researched the topic and concluded there is not that one answer to the question.</p>
<p>What works for you depends on your project’s type, what you want to do, who you develop the software for, and many more things. Here is a list of ideas you can try or even combine to make money with your open source projects. Hopefully, that helps you to free more time for the things you love to work on.</p>
<h2 id="donations">Donations</h2>
<p>People are kind, so why not adding a donate button to your README? That’s an easy way to get a little money for your work. Unfortunately, that didn’t work for us. We asked for donations for our work on tiptap, a popular package that took us a few hundred hours to develop.</p>
<p>Hundreds of developers, companies, and even a few big corporations use it, but we earned less than $300 through PayPal donations over the last three years. Don’t get me wrong, we are very thankful for every dollar, but this makes an hourly rate of less than $1. That’s not sustainable, and not enough to work less on client projects and more on the bespoken project.</p>
<h2 id="licenses">Licenses</h2>
<p>Your source code can stay open source, but add a license that requires people to pay for permission to use it in their projects. And to keep it fair, you can exclude non-commercial projects, non-profit organizations, students, and other open source projects.</p>
<p>Note, it might be hard to enforce the license for publicly accessible source code.</p>
<h2 id="goodwill-licenses">Goodwill licenses</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to waste time enforcing a license, you could sell a goodwill license. It’s in between donations and regular licenses, where you kindly ask the users of your project to pay. But inside companies, it’s easier to argue for paying for a license than for a donation.</p>
<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
<p>Some developers or companies need support to use your software. You can offer them support contracts, e. g. to promise a short response time for bug reports or availability for calls. Some companies require this level of support, some will use it extensively, and some won’t ever use it.</p>
<p>Offering support can work well for teams but can be a distraction from the work they are good at for single developers.</p>
<h2 id="contracting">Contracting</h2>
<p>If you open sourced something like a complex library, companies might want to hire you to implement your solution in their system. They know that you are the expert for the software you’ve written and happily pay you, even if it’s more than an average freelancer rate.</p>
<p>If you enjoy open source because you didn’t want to work with clients, that’s probably not for you. On the other hand, you’ll always use your code, which will help better understand the needs to implement your software.</p>
<h2 id="dual-licensing">Dual licensing</h2>
<p>Your software can have multiple licenses. For example, a basic version can be free for everyone, while another version, probably more tailored to what companies need, can be licensed differently.</p>
<p>Your publicly accessible software still allows collaboration. You would probably want to keep the advanced version closed to enforce the license. Keep in mind that maintaining different versions of software in parallel is more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="freemium">Freemium</h2>
<p>Also, consider offering a free version for everyone and add a few benefits for professional use that are only available for paying users.</p>
<p>Those extra benefits can be access to more features/plugins or other things like a community with restricted access.</p>
<h2 id="managed-hosting">Managed hosting</h2>
<p>If your software needs hosting and can be self-hosted, consider offering a managed hosting solution. Many people don’t want to operate their instance and happily pay you to do that for them.</p>
<p>You need to develop something to sell it, provision new instances, and maintain them. It’s a very fair approach and can work well, as you’ll always have people paying for convenience.</p>

<p>There are so many platforms tailored to easily offer sponsorship subscriptions to your users that you should think about adding this. But be aware that it’s the same as with donations. You won’t get many sponsors, but it’s recurring revenue that can help you feel safe.</p>
<h2 id="day-job">Day job</h2>
<p>Some companies make open source part of your day job. If you don’t need to work on an own project, but love a regular job’s safety, consider looking for such an employer.</p>
<p>By the way, we’re looking for a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/frontend-engineer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">frontend engineer</a> and a <a href="https://ueberdosis.io/php-developer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PHP developer</a>, both roles include working on existing and new open source projects.</p>

<p>People always request features. Try turning feature requests into sponsored work, and offer to add those features in exchange for money. If multiple users or companies ask for the same functionality, you can even offer to share the development costs. Don’t forget to mention your sponsors in the release notes!</p>
<h2 id="bounties">Bounties</h2>
<p>Bounties enable users to attach money to a bug report. In most cases, that’s only a few dollars, but it doesn’t have to be you working on it. It can also motivate contributors to help you with the maintenance, which is cool too.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/sponsorware/docs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sponsorware</a> is a way to offer sponsors early-access to private repositories. When you reach a certain number of sponsors, you can open source the project and make it available to everyone.</p>
<p>It will help if you start new projects regularly and have an audience that can’t wait to test them.</p>
<h2 id="audience">Audience</h2>
<p>You can use your open source work as marketing for yourself and build up an audience. It takes time and doesn’t make you money from that alone, but it’s a chance to sell something additional. You probably know what your followers want, so it can be great to build something for them and make money with that.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of extra work on top of your open source projects. You should consider this if you are very active on social media anyway.</p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p>You are the expert for your software, so I’d want to learn more about your software. I prefer to get that educational content from you. Consider publishing an ebook or a video course that explains your software in all details and helps people use it.</p>
<h2 id="crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</h2>
<p>With an existing audience interested in your software, there is a good chance people are willing to pay you upfront to work on your project. It’s an excellent approach for something tangible, like a significant rewrite, a big shift in the development, or any other effort the community is willing to support.</p>
<h2 id="ads">Ads</h2>
<p>If you’ve got widespread documentation with thousands of page views every month, you’ll be able to put ads on it and earn money with that.</p>
<p>It’s not what we like to do because it’s little money to sell people’s privacy using your software. That said, some companies try to take an ethical approach to ads.</p>
<h2 id="shop">Shop</h2>
<p>If your software has a brand and people identify with it, a shop might work well for you. You can sell stickers, shirts, caps, posters, and whatnot.</p>
<p>Those products still cost you money, so you’ll only earn a part of what the customer pays for the product.</p>
<h2 id="products">Products</h2>
<p>Maybe you have a software that can be the foundation for a whole ecosystem. Then you have the chance to add commercial products to the universe of your software.</p>
<p>People will buy your products because you’ll tailor them precisely for the software you built in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="paid-certifications">Paid certifications</h2>
<p>If companies are looking for developers with knowledge of your software, you can certify developers’ abilities. But if you already reached that level of popularity, you probably don’t need that post here anyway.</p>
<p>That said, we’ll hope that your open source project gains popularity and the list of things you can do somehow helps you make the maintenance and development sustainable.</p>
<p>Let’s face it—nobody profits from abandoned open source projects.</p>
<p>That should give you a rough idea of what directions you could take.

<p>Feel free to point out other ways or resources to make open source work sustainable <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24835485" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">on HackerNews</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/hanspagel/status/1318488075182497792" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">on Twitter</a>!</p>

There are not so many off-the-shelf packages available. Plus, training a neural IR system requires quite some data.

There are three modalities in the reading comprehension setting: question, answer and context. One can define two problems from different directions:</p><ul><li><strong>Question Answering</strong> (QA): infer an answer given a question and the context;</li><li><strong>Question Generation</strong> (QG): infer a question given an answer and the context.</li></ul><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2018/09/09/Dual-Ask-Answer-Network-for-Machine-Reading-Comprehension/d20488e5.png"></p><p>Careful readers may notice that there is some sort of cycle consistency between QA and QG: they are both defined as inferring one modality given the counterpart based on context.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="sequence-encoding-as-a-service">Sequence Encoding as a Service</span></h4><blockquote><p>So if many NLP applications rely on semantic features, then why donâ€™t we build a sentence encoding infrastructure that can serve multiple teams? This idea, despite how simple and straightforward, is not really practical until recently. Because many deep learning algorithms tailor the vector representation to a specific task or domain. Consequently, the representation from one application/team is not really reusable to other applications/teams. On contrary, BERT (as well as <a href="https://allennlp.org/elmo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ELMo</a> and <a href="http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ULMFit</a>) decomposes an NLP task into <em>task-independent</em> pretraining and <em>task-specific</em> fine-tuning stages, where pretraining learns a model that is general enough and can be reused in many downstream tasks.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="bert-as-service-architecture">Bert-as-service Architecture</span></h4><blockquote><p>Decoupling also clarifies the C/S role. When the feature extraction becomes the bottleneck, then scale up the GPU server. When the downstream network is the bottleneck, then optimize the client by adding more CPU machines or doing quantization. When training data is too old or concept-drifted, then retrain the BERT and version-control the server, all downstream networks immediately enjoy the updated feature vectors. Finally, as all requests come to one place, your GPU server has less idle cycles and every penny is spent worthily.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2019/01/02/Serving-Google-BERT-in-Production-using-Tensorflow-and-ZeroMQ/d5ff2731.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="training-indexing-and-querying-in-a-neural-search-system">Training, Indexing, and Querying in a Neural Search System</span></h4><blockquote><p>The first concept Iâ€™d like to introduce is the <strong>runtime</strong>. In a typical search system, there are two fundamental tasks: <strong>indexing</strong> and <strong>querying</strong>. Indexing is storing the documents, querying is searching the documents on a given query, pretty straightforward. In a neural search system, one may also face another task: <strong>training</strong>, where one fine-tunes the model according to the data distribution to achieve better search relevance.</p></blockquote><h4><span id="jina-is-tensorflow-for-search">Jina is â€œTensorflowâ€� for Search</span></h4><blockquote><p>I often use the analogy <em>â€œTensorflowâ€� for search</em> to explain what Jina is. Jina sits one layer above the universal deep learning framework (e.g., Tensorflow, Pytorch, Mindspore); it provides the infrastructure for building AI-powered search applications. So the next time you develop a multi-/cross-modalities search app (question answering, image/video/audio search), Jina will be your go-to <em>â€œprogramming languageâ€�</em>. It helps you get the job done quickly and beautifully by providing you first-class support on AI models and rich cloud-native features.</p><p><img src="https://hanxiao.io/2020/08/02/Layer-of-Abstraction-when-Building-Tensorflow-for-Search/e8b561b2.png"></p></blockquote><h4><span id="jina-is-not-an-one-liner">Jina is Not an One-Liner</span></h4><blockquote><p>Jina follows a progressive way when doing abstraction.

October 20, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>
<hr>
<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>

<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If programmers were just more disciplined, more <em>professional</em>, they’d write better software. All they need is a <a href="https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Martin-Clean-Coder-The-A-Code-of-Conduct-for-Professional-Programmers/PGM8366.html">code of conduct</a> telling them how to work like those of us who’ve worked it out.</p>
<p>The above statement is true, which is a good thing for those of us interested in improving the state of software and in helping our fellow professionals to improve their craft. However, it’s also very difficult and inefficient to apply, in addition to being entirely unnecessary. In the common parlance of our industry, “discipline doesn’t scale”.</p>
<p>Consider the trajectory of object lifecycle management in the Objective-C programming language, particularly the NeXT dialect. Between 1989 and 1995, the dominant way to deal with the lifecycle of objects was to use the <tt>+new</tt> and <tt>-free</tt> methods, which work much like <tt>malloc/free</tt> in C or <tt>new/delete</tt> in C++. Of course it’s <em>possible</em> to design a complex object graph using this ownership model, it just needs discipline, that’s all. Learn the heuristics that the experts use, and the techniques to ensure correctness, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So around 1994 people introduced new tools to do it an easier way: reference counting. With NeXTSTEP Mach Kit’s <tt>NXReference</tt> protocol and OpenStep’s <tt>NSObject</tt>, developers no longer need to know when <em>everybody</em> in an app is done with an object to destroy it. They can indicate when a reference is taken and when it’s relinquished, and the object itself will see when it’s no longer used and free itself. Learn the heuristics and techniques around auto releasing and unretained references, and get it correct.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? Not having to get that right. So a couple of other tools were introduced, so close together that they were probably developed in parallel[*]: Objective-C 2.0 garbage collection (2006) and Automatic Reference Counting (2008). ARC “won” in popular adoption so let’s focus there: developers no longer need to know exactly when to retain, release, or autorelease objects. Instead of describing the edges of the relationships, they describe the <em>meanings</em> of the relationships and the compiler will automatically take care of ownership tracking. Learn the heuristics and techniques around weak references and the “weak self” dance, and get it correct.</p>
<p>[*] I’m ignoring here the significantly earlier integration of the Boehm conservative GC with Objective-C, because so did everybody else. That in itself is an important part of the technology adoption story.</p>
<p>But you know what’s better? You get the idea. You see similar things happen in other contexts: for example C++’s move from <tt>new/delete</tt> to smart pointers follows a similar trajectory over a similar time. The reliance on an entire programming community getting some difficult rules right, when faced with the alternative of using different technology <em>on the same computer</em> that follows the rules for you, is a tough sell.</p>
<p>It seems so simple: computers exist to automate repetitive information-processing tasks. Requiring programmers who have access to computers to recall and follow repetitive information processes is wasteful, when the computer can do that. So give those tasks to the computers.</p>
<p>And yet, for some people the problem with software isn’t a lack of automation but a lack of discipline. Software would be better if only people knew the rules, honoured them, and slowed themselves down so that instead of cutting corners they just chose to ignore important business milestones instead. Back in my day, everybody knew “no Markdown around town” and “don’t code in an IDE after Labour Day”, but now the kids do whatever they want. The motivations seem different, and I’d like to sort them out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with hazing. A lot of the software industry suffers from “I had to go through this, you should too”. Look at software engineering interviews, for example. I’m not sure whether anybody actually believes “I had to deal with carefully ensuring NUL-termination to avoid buffer overrun errors so you should too”, but I do occasionally still hear people telling less-experienced developers that they should learn C to learn more about how their computer works. <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479">Your computer is not a fast PDP-11</a>, all you will learn is how the C virtual machine works.</p>
<p>Just as Real Men Don’t Eat Quiche, so <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/articles/927/real-programmers-don-t-use-pascal">real programmers don’t use Pascal</a>. Real Programmers use FORTRAN. This motivation for sorting discipline from rabble is based on the idea that if it isn’t at least as hard as it was when <em>I</em> did this, it isn’t hard enough. And that means that the goalposts are movable, based on the orator’s experience.</p>
<p>This is often related to the <em>term</em> of their experience: you don’t need TypeScript to write good React Native code, just Javascript and some discipline. You don’t need React Native to write good front-end code, just JQuery and some discipline. You don’t need JQuery…</p>
<p>But along with the term of experience goes the breadth. You see, the person who learned reference counting in 1995 and thinks that you can only <em>really</em> understand programming if you manually type out your own reference-changing events, presumably didn’t go on to use garbage collection in Java in 1996. The person who thinks you can only <em>really</em> write correct software if every case is accompanied by a unit test presumably didn’t learn Eiffel. The person who thinks that you can only <em>really</em> design systems if you use the Haskell type system may not have tried OCaml. And so on.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that for this variety of disciplinarian, the appropriate character and quantity of discipline is whatever they had to deal with at some specific point in their career. Probably a high point: after they’d got over the tricky bits and got productive, and after you kids came along and ruined everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes the reason for suggesting the disciplined approach is entomological in nature, as in the case of the eusocial insect the “performant” which, while not a real word, exists in greater quantities in older software than in newer software, apparently. The performant is capable of making software faster, or use less memory, or more concurrent, or less dependent on I/O: the specific characteristics of the performant depend heavily on context.</p>
<p>The performant is often not talked about in the same sentences as its usual companion species, the irrelevant. Yes, there may be opportunities to shave a few percent off the runtime of that algorithm by switching from the automatic tool to the manual, disciplined approach, but does that matter (yet, or at all)? There are software-construction domains where specific performance characteristics are desirable, indeed that’s true across a lot of software. But it’s typical to focus performance-enhancing techniques on the bits where they enhance performance that needs enhancing, not to adopt them across the whole system on the basis that it was better when everyone worked this way. You might save a few hundred cycles writing native software instead of using a VM for that UI method, but if it’s going to run after a network request completes over EDGE then trigger a 1/3s animation, nobody will notice the improvement.</p>
<p>Anyway, whatever the source, the problem with calls for discipline is that there’s no strong motivation to <em>become</em> more disciplined. I can use these tools, and my customer is this much satisfied, and my employer pays me this much. Or I can learn from you how I’m <em>supposed</em> to be doing it, which will slow me down, for…your satisfaction? So you know I’m doing it the way it’s supposed to be done? Or so that I can tell everyone else that they’re doing it wrong, too? Sounds like a great deal.</p>
<p>Therefore discipline doesn’t scale. Whenever you ask some people to slow down and think harder about what they’re doing, some fraction of them will. Some will wonder whether there’s some other way to get what you’re peddling, and may find it. Some more will not pay any attention. The dangerous ones are the ones who thought they <em>were</em> paying attention and yet still end up not doing the disciplined thing you asked for: they either torpedo your whole idea or turn it into not doing the thing (see OOP, Agile, Functional Programming). And still more people, by far the vast majority, just weren’t listening at all, and you’ll never reach them.</p>
<p>Let’s flip this around. Let’s look at where we <em>need</em> to be disciplined, and ask if there are gaps in the tool support for software engineers. Some people want us to always write a failing test and make it pass before adding any code (or want us to write a passing test and revert our changes if it accidentally fails): does that mean our tools should not let us write code for which there’s no test? Does the same apply for acceptance tests? Some want us to refactor mercilessly; does that mean our design tools should always propose more parsimonious alternatives for passing the same tests? Some say we should get into the discipline of writing code that always reveals its intent: should the tools make a crack at interpreting the intention of the code-as-prose?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy">Privacy on the Internet</a> is important because privacy risks range from the gathering of statistics on users to more malicious acts such as the spreading of spyware and the exploitation of various forms of bugs (software faults). Many companies, such as Google, track which websites people visit and then use the information, for instance by sending advertising based on one's web browsing history. Sometimes prices on products are changed on the same website, depending on tracking information, and two people may view the exact same product on the exact same website yet be presented with very different prices.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article isn't specifically about privacy issues only, it's about promises that are being broken, which might be about privacy. It is also about the lack of user freedom, as in the choice to enable or disable features, such as automatic updates, or forced usage of third party services, or software that the user generally is unaware of or don't have a say about.</p>

<p>Privacy as a subject regarding the usage of services on the Internet is a very difficult subject to deal with. Not only can it be difficult to actually define privacy, but it also requires a balance between freedom of choice by the users, security and usability. Naturally you need to be able to use the browser on the Internet and as such you will always leave some kind of trail behind, and this article is not about how you can hide your tracks. What I am addressing in this article are browsers that are either promoted as "privacy respecting" by the developers, or in general are considered to be so (mostly due to misunderstanding or misinformation), while it is very clear they are not.</p>

<p>Some browsers either directly violate users by collecting telemetric data without consent, or you have to opt-out rather than opt-in, or they bounce around the Internet visiting places in the background without you knowing (using dns-prefetch or automatic updates etc.), using third party services that operates with a privacy policy you either cannot trust, or that are directly violating your privacy, or they have integrated third party software that do some of these things.</p>

<p>I will try to keep this article updated with relevant information as much as possible. I know several other browsers exist, but if they are not mentioned on this list I have either not had a change to investigate them, they are closed source and completely irrelevant (such as Microsoft Edge or Opera), or they are not actively maintained, or they are perhaps a "one mans show" which cannot be trusted for some reason or another.</p>

<p>I will also <strong>not</strong> be looking at browsers that only work on Microsoft Windows or macOS, even if they are Open Source. Both Microsoft Windows and macOS are highly controversial and completely untrustworthy operating systems.</p>

<p>Also please note that just because the developers of a browser are promising that their browser is privacy respecting doesn't mean that you can trust the information. As you will see with the examples of some of the browsers below even developers some times compromise user privacy perhaps without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>I also want to make a strong advice to people recommending browsers to other people without investigation or knowledge. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/">privacy related channel on Reddit</a> is filled with wrong recommendations regarding privacy respecting browsers and many people are merely guessing or blindly trusting the information the browser producers are publishing. Neither Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Chromium, Brave, Waterfox, or several of the other recommended browsers truly respect privacy. They all do some form of telemetry and/or privacy compromising actions without the user consenting to it or even knowing about it.</p>

<p>Also, privacy doesn't mean that you simply pull out telemetry from Firefox, rebrand it, and then ship it. Privacy is more than that. Unless the browser is automatically checking for an updated version, and the website isn't logging that request, it cannot be considered truly private if the browser starts bouncing around on the Internet visiting all kinds of places without the user has done anything more than open the browser up! Every time the browser makes a DNS request, that DNS request is in most cases logged unless the user actively does something to mitigate that - such as using a trusted VPN or non-logging DNS service etc. Furthermore, the Mozilla add-on CDN is logging user activity, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_CloudFront">Amazon Cloudfront</a>, so if the browser visits these places without the user explicitly pushes a "check for updates" option, the browser is compromising user privacy. The point I'm trying to make is that the user needs to have the choice and that nothing happens until the user actively do something.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, if you discover any mistakes on my part, feel free to email me about it so that I can correct the information.</p>

<h2 id="third-party-clones">Third party clones</h2>
<p>Several third party clones of Firefox and Chromium exist that are branded and promoted as secure and privacy respecting alternatives that cannot fully be trusted for some reason or another. The code base for both Firefox and Chromium are huge and many skillful people work on the code every day. Having a "one mans show" or a small team of developers diverted browser clone running on your computer that are days, weeks or even months behind security updates does not improve neither your privacy nor your security in any way.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-compromising">Privacy compromising browsers</h2>

<h3 id="firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h3>
<p>In the past I have always supported Mozilla and promoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>, but Mozilla has made some pretty controversial decisions as of late and I no longer feel that Mozilla is an organization that deserves any support.</p>
<p>Firefox is promoted by Mozilla as a privacy respecting browser, but this is highly misleading. Firefox "phones home" every time you start it up even when you have disabled telemetry and automatic updates of extensions. Domains such as mozilla.org, cloudfront.net, firefox.settings.services.mozilla.com (see: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1598562#c12</a>), autopush.prod.mozaws.net, detectportal.firefox.com and location.services.mozilla.com are visited each time you start Firefox.</p>
<p>In 2017 Mozilla made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliqz#Integration_with_Firefox">deal with Cliqz</a> where approximately 1% of users downloading Firefox in Germany would receive a version with Cliqz software included. And in 2018 Mozilla revealed that they had no data on the number of Firefox installations with disabled Telemetry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we need better insight into our opt-out rates for telemetry. We use telemetry to ensure new features improve your user experience and to guide Mozilla's business decisions. However, an unknown portion of our users do not report telemetry for a variety of reasons. This means we may not have data that is representative of our entire population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mozilla then developed the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1487578">Telemetry Coverage</a> system and distributed it to 1% of the Firefox installations. The system is automatically installed and designed to inform Mozilla whether telemetry is enabled in the browser.</p>
<p>Mozilla also <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/telemetry-collection-windows-default-browser-trend">developed a Windows-only scheduled task</a> which runs in the background once a day for each installation of Firefox installed on a computer running Microsoft Windows. The task collects information related to the system's current and previous default browser setting and the operating system locale and version.</p>
<p>This is a list of some of the things that Mozilla collects: <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#suggest-relevant-content</a>.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/">Mozilla website</a> we can read (when I originally started writing this article) that <q>We put people over profit</q>, and <q>a product to support user privacy</q>. We can also read in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla manifesto</a>, in the fourth principle, that <q>Individuals' security and privacy on the internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.</q> However, with their decision to make Cloudflare the default DNS provider for DNS over HTTPS, they are definitely not supporting user privacy or putting people over profit!</p>
<p>DNS over HTTPS is by itself <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxTdEEuyxHU">bad enough</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS#Criticism">highly criticized</a> with good reason, but combining it with a US based company like Cloudflare makes it even worse.</p>
<p>Cloudflare has made an <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/firefox/">agreement</a> with Mozilla that when it acts as a DNS resolver for Firefox, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNS requests will be stored as part of Cloudflare's "temporary" logs which are permanently deleted within 24 hours.</li>
<li>Cloudflare will also collect and store the following information as part of its permanent logs:
<ul>
<li>Total number of requests processed by each Cloudflare co-location facility.</li>
<li>Aggregate list of all domain names requested.</li>
<li>Samples of domain names queried along with the times of such queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Information stored in Cloudflare's permanent logs will be anonymized and may be held indefinitely by Cloudflare for its own internal research and development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who has worked with DNS servers knows what goes into such logs and in order for Cloudflare to keep their promise they need to: Delete the DNS requests information, but at the same time somehow still keep "anonymized" logs of the total number of requests, a list of all domain names requested, a so-called "sample" of complete DNS queries along with date and time.</p>
<p>This means that even if Cloudflare could be trusted and they have the best of intentions, they will still log everything the first 24 hours. If Cloudflare is ever compromised all these logs could be copied and distributed over a period of time.</p>

    <p>The compact disc—the CD—was co-developed by Philips and Sony back in the 1980s.<sup id="fnref:updates-cd"><a href="#fn:updates-cd" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This format was initially developed to store and play music but was then adapted to what we know as the CD-ROM to store data as well, and other formats followed that allowed us to read and write different kinds of data.</p>
<p>In 1995, Microsoft shipped Windows 95 as a CD-ROM and also as a pack of 13 or 26 floppy disks for compatibility with older computers that didn't have a compact disc reader. The entire Windows 95 operating system was only around 22 to 24 megabytes. (More than four times smaller than Instagram for iPhone!)</p>
<p>Priced at dozens or hundreds of dollars, software used to come packed in a huge box. The lucky software, the one that could afford the development costs, would update every couple of years. Windows 95, for instance, released a few updates and patches in 1996 and 1997, while Windows 98 was cooking.</p>
<p>The transaction happened at a physical store where we were buying something tangible: a program packed in a box.</p>
<p>The Office Suite—Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint—was bought in a box and installed in your machine with a CD. Every time you formatted your computer or bought a new one, you would come back to those CDs and re-install the software. Office 2003. 2009. 2013. These updates demarcated the appearance of file formats and new functionality that wouldn't work in older versions.</p>
<p>Today you buy a phone with a set of preinstalled apps and, right at your fingertips, you have an app store. With a payment method, you can make a transaction with a finger tap, your fingerprint, or a scan of your face. The app starts installing right away. Maybe free, maybe a couple of dollars. This world is cheaper but gets more and more expensive as we transition into a subscription model. And stores are not only on your phone but on your tablet, laptop, browser, and even on your photo camera or game console.</p>
<p>We get notified of new versions of the apps we use daily. And there's a culture of constant improvement in which applications like Dropbox, Spotify, or Uber release a new version weekly or bi-weekly to keep up-to-date.</p>
<p>At any stage, software bugs can be introduced, existing ones fixed, and new functionality added. We used to have a program that would continue to work the same way for years. But we now have what's called <em>liquid software</em>. Ever-changing code and hundreds of version numbers. (Dropbox is up to version 107.4.443 as I write these lines!)</p>
<p>We're in an era of constant updates, and there's no way back. If there's a bug today, we expect a fix tomorrow. A patch, an update. The problem comes when we can't say no and need to keep programs up-to-date to run on the latest operating systems that would otherwise stop functioning.</p>
<p>Software rots.</p>
<p>In the mobile world, there's a chance that you never upgrade and use a fixed set of functionality. But the web is different. When you load a website, it might have been re-deployed. A new version, updated seconds ago, runs in your browser. The red button you used yesterday to send an email might have changed its place, color, or shape overnight. A piece of functionality you liked (or the annoying bug you had yesterday) might suddenly go away.</p>
<p>An alternative might be to use custom systems or systems with slower update cycles in which backward compatibility is a priority.</p>
<p>Yet it's unlikely we'll ever go back to the once-a-year update, the diskette, or the CD.</p>

    <p>Gui­de for Emer­gen­cy Pre­pa­red­ness and Cor­rect Ac­ti­on in Emer­gen­cy Si­tua­ti­ons</p>


<p>What can you do for your sa­fe­ty in the event of a di­sas­ter?</p>

<p>In spring 2013, af­ter weeks of rain, who­le are­as of southern, eas­tern and nor­thern Ger­ma­ny we­re be­set by ca­ta­stro­phic floods. Sett­le­ments va­nis­hed in the floods up to the roofs of the hou­ses, tens of thou­sands of emer­gen­cy per­son­nel and vol­un­teers strug­gled against the wa­ter with sand­bags. Vil­la­ges and parts of towns had to be eva­cua­ted, and the ci­ti­zens we­re on­ly ab­le to ta­ke the es­sen­ti­als with them.</p>

<p>Di­sas­ters are part of li­fe. Al­most eve­ry day, we can read about di­sas­ters and lar­ges­ca­le emer­gen­cies in a va­rie­ty of me­dia and see the images of de­struc­ti­on and suf­fe­ring. The­se are not just ma­jor di­sas­ters which af­fect lar­ge are­as for a long ti­me. Lo­cal tor­ren­ti­al rain, a se­ve­re storm, an elec­tric power break­down re­sul­ting from such a storm, or a hou­se fi­re can trig­ger a ve­ry per­so­nal di­sas­ter for each in­di­vi­du­al, each fa­mi­ly, which has to be over­co­me. Ta­ke the ti­me to con­tem­pla­te your per­so­nal emer­gen­cy plan­ning.</p>

<p>This bro­chu­re aims to help you to de­ve­lop your per­so­nal pre­pa­red­ness plan.</p>

. With Chrome holding around 70% of browser market share, you could say HTTP/3 has gone mainstream.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/quic-logo.png" alt="QUIC logo"></p><p>The new revision of this foundational protocol aims to make the web more efficient, secure, and shorten the content-delivery latencies. In some ways, it’s a braver take of HTTP2: similar goals addressed by replacing the underlying TCP protocol with a new, purpose-built protocol QUIC. The best way to explain the benefits of QUIC is to illustrate where TCP falls short as a transport for HTTP requests. And to do that, we’ll start at the very beginning.</p><h3 id="http-the-original">HTTP. The Original.</h3><p>When Sir Tim Berners-Lee formalized the design of a simple <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line hyper-text-exchange protocol</a>
in 1991, TCP was already an old, reliable protocol. The original definition document of what later became known as HTTP 0.9 specifically mentions TCP as a preferred, albeit not exclusive, transport protocol:</p><blockquote><p>Note: HTTP currently runs over TCP, but could run over any connection-oriented service.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, this proof-of-concept version of HTTP had very few similarities to HTTP we now know and love today. There were no headers and no status codes. The typical request was as simple as <code>GET /path</code>. The response contained only HTML and ended with the closing of the TCP connection.
Since browsers were not yet a thing, user was supposed to read HTML directly. It was possible to link to other resources, but none of the tags present in this early version of HTML requested additional resources asynchronously. A single HTTP request delivered a complete, self-sufficient page.</p><h3 id="emergence-of-http10">Emergence of HTTP/1.0</h3><p>In subsequent years the internet has exploded, and HTTP evolved to be an extendable and flexible general-purpose protocol, although transporting HTML remained its chief specialty. There are three critical updates to HTTP that enabled this evolution:</p><ul><li>introduction of methods allowed the client to identify the type of action it wants to perform. For example, POST was created to allow client sending data to the server to process and store</li><li>status codes provided a way for client to confirm that the server has processed the request successfully, and if not - to understand what kind of error has occured</li><li>headers added an ability to attach structured textual metadata to requests and responses that could modify the behavior of the client or server. Encoding and content-type headers, for example, allowed HTTP to transfer not just HTML, but any type of payload. “Compression” header allowed the client and server to negotiate supported compression formats, thus reducing the amount of data to transfer over the connection</li></ul><p>At the same time, HTML advanced to support images, styles, and other linked resources. Browsers were now forced to perfrom multiple requests to display a single web page, which the original connection-per-request architecture was not designed to handle. Establishing and ending a TCP connection involves a lot of back-and-forth packet exchange, so it is relatively expensive in terms of latency overhead. It didn’t matter much when a web-page consisted of a single text file, but as the number of requests per page increased, so did the latency.</p><p>The picture below illustrates how much overhead was involved in establishing a new TCP connection per request.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-tcp-overhead.png" alt="TCP connection requires three requests to establish connection and four to close it cleanly"></p><p>A “connection” header was created to address this problem. Client sends a request with “connection: keep-alive” header to signal intent to keep the TCP connection open for subsequent requests. If server understands this header and agrees to respect it, its response will also contain the “connection: keep-alive” header. This way, both parties maintain TCP channel open and use it for subsequent communication until either party decides to close it. This became even more important with the spread of SSL/TLS encryption, because negotianting an encryption algorithm and exchanging cryptographic keys requires an additional request/response cycle on each connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http1-keepalive.png" alt="A single TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests with “connection: keep-alive” header"></p><p>At the time, many of the HTTP improvements appeared spontaneously. When a popular browser or a server app saw a need for a new HTTP feature, they would simply implement it themselves and hoped that other parties would follow the suit. Ironically, a decentralized web needed a centralized governing body to avoid fragmentation into incompatible pieces. Tim Berners-Lee, the original creator of the protocol, recognized the danger and founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1994, which together with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) worked on formalizing stack of internet technologies. As the initial step to bring more structure to the existing environment, they documented the most common features used in HTTP at the time and named the resulting protocol HTTP/1.0. However, because this “specification” described varied, often inconsistent techniques as seen “in the wild”, it never received a status of a standard. Instead, the work on the new version of the HTTP protocol has begun.</p><h3 id="standardization-of-http11">Standardization of HTTP/1.1</h3><p>HTTP/1.1 fixed inconsistencies of HTTP/1.0 and adjusted the protocol to be more performant in the new web ecosystem. Two of the most critical changes introduced were the use of persistent TCP connections (keep-alive’s) by default and HTTP pipelining.</p><p>HTTP pipelining simply means that client does not need to wait for the server to respond to a request before sending subsequent HTTP requests. This feature resulted in even more efficient use of bandwidth and reduced latencies, but it could be improved even more. HTTP pipelining still requires from server to respond in the order of requests received, so if a single request in a pipeline is slow to fulfill, all subsequent responses to a client will be delayed accordingly. This problem is known as head-of-the-line blocking.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http11-blocking.png" alt="Since large-picture.jpg was requested first, it’s blocking the delivery of the style.css"></p><p>At this point in time, the web is gaining more and more interactive capabilities. Web 2.0 is just around the corner, some webpages include dozens or even hundreds of external resources. To work around the head-of-the-line blocking, and to decrease page loading speeds, clients establish multiple TCP connections per host. Of course, the connection overhead never went anywhere. In reality, it got worse, since more and more applications encrypt HTTP traffic with SSL/TLS. So most browsers set the limit of maximal possible simultaneous connections in an attempt to strike a delicate balance.</p><p>Many of the larger web-services have recognized that existing limitations are too restricting for their exceptionally heavy interactive web-applications, so they “gamed the system” by distributing their app through multiple domain names. It all worked, somehow, but the solution has been far from elegant.</p><p>Despite a few shortcomings, the simplicity of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 has made them widely successful, and for over a decade no one has made a serious attempt to change them.</p><h3 id="spdy-and-http2">SPDY and HTTP/2</h3><p>In 2008 Google released the Chrome browser, which rapidly gained popularity for being quick and innovative. It has given Google a strong vote on matters of internet technologies. In the early 2010s, Google adds support for its web protocol SPDY to Chrome.</p><p>HTTP/2 standard was based on SPDY with some improvements. HTTP/2 solved the head-of-the-line blocking problem by multiplexing the HTTP requests over a single open TCP connection. This allowed server to answer requests in any order, client could then re-assemble the responses as it received them, making the whole exchange faster within a single connection.</p><p><img src="https://scorpil.com/img/the-long-road-to-http3/http2-multiplexing.png" alt="style.css was returned before the large-picture.jpg, becuase of HTTP/2 multiplexing"></p><p>In fact, with HTTP/2 server can serve the resources to a client before it even asked for it! To give an example, if the server knows that client will most likely need a stylesheet to display an HTML page, it can “push” the CSS to the client without waiting for a corresponding request. While beneficial in theory, this feature rarely seen in practice, since it requires a server to understand the structure of the HTML it serves, which is rarely the case.</p><p>HTTP/2 also allows compressing request headers in addition to the request body, which further reduces the amount of data transferred over the wire.</p><p>HTTP/2 solved a lot of problems for the web, but not all of them. A similar type of head-of-the-line problem is still present on the level of TCP protocol, which remains a foundational building block of the web. When a TCP packet gets lost in transit, the receiver can’t acknowledge incoming packages until the lost package is re-sent by a server. Since TCP is by design oblivious to higher-level protocols like HTTP, a single lost packet will block the stream for all in-flight HTTP requests until the missing data is re-sent. This problem is especially prominent on an unreliable connection, which is not rare in the age of ubiquitous mobile devices.</p><h3 id="http3-revolution">HTTP/3 revolution</h3><p>Since issues with HTTP/2 can not be resolved purely on the application layer a new iteration of the protocol must update the transport layer. However, creating a new transport-layer protocol is not an easy task. Transport protocols need to be supported by hardware vendors and deployed by the majority of network operators, which are reluctant to update because of the costs and efforts involved. Take IPv6 as an example: it was introduced 24 years ago and is still far from being universally supported.</p><p>Fortunately, there is another option. UDP protocol is as widely supported as TCP but is simple enough to serve as a building block for custom protocols running on top of it. UDP packets are fire-and-forget: there are no handshakes, persistent connections, or error-correction. The primary idea behind HTTP3 is to abandon TCP in favor of a UDP-based QUIC protocol. QUIC adds the necessary features (those that were previously provided by TCP, and more) in a way that makes sense for the web environment.</p><p>Unlike HTTP2, which technically allowed an unencrypted communication, QUIC strictly requires encryption to establish a connection. Additionally, encryption is applied to all data …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<h2><span>Adolphe Sax, a Dinantais of genius</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Along with Joachim Patenier (1485-1524), the creator of landscape painting; with Antoine Wiertz (1806-1865), the lyrical painter; with a plethora of sculptors, painters, musicians, brassworkers and others, Dinant can legitimately pride itself on having been the birthplace on 6 November 1814 of Antoine-Joseph, or Adolphe, Sax, a prolific and inspired inventor in the manufacture of musical instruments.</p>
<p>In 1860, the diarist, Oscar Comettant, wrote, "In the services that he has rendered to musical art, in the battles he has had to go through to bring his discoveries to the light of day and defend them from despoilment and in the rewards he has been the object of from all the industrial nations, [Sax's life] rises to the heights of a social event. Novelists will draw from this strange life mysterious and moving episodes (we would add: the legal world will find in the account of the "Sax trial" a vast domain for a case law study) and the moralists will find in it the features of self-denial, physical courage and perseverance, of which only a lifted soul and a great heart are capable.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Enfance"></a>
<h2><span>An Agitated Childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Antoine-Joseph Sax was born in the street that has borne his name since 1896, in a modest house, which was destroyed in 1914, and which was built on the present site of an important commercial building.</p>
<p>In its façade, there is a stained-glass window and an inscription chiselled into the stonework: "Adolphe Sax, 1814-1894, was born here". This window was solemnly inaugurated on 27 June 1954, on the initiative of the Tourist Information Centre, under the mayorship of Mr Léon Sasserath. It is the work of Mr Jean Jadin, who designed the cartoon, and Miss Maggy Arzée. Both were taught by Miss Yvonne Gérard and Mr Perot, teachers of graphic art and decoration at the Fine Arts Academy in Namur, which was then directed by Mr Lambeau. It was created under the direction of Mr Van de Capelle.</p>
<p>Son of Charles-Joseph Sax (1791-1865) and Marie-Joseph Masson (1813-1861), Antoine-Joseph was the eldest of eleven children (six boys and five girls, only four of whom survived, the others dying between the ages of 20 and 25).</p>
<p>His childhood was tragic. Hardly able to stand, Antoine-Joseph fell from a height of three floors, seriously bumping his head against a stone: he was believed dead. At the age of three, he swallowed a bowl of vitriolized water, and then a pin. Later, he was seriously burned in a gunpowder explosion; he fell onto a cast iron frying pan and burned himself on one side. Three times he escaped poisoning and asphyxiation in his bedroom, where varnished items were lying about during the night. Another time, he was hit on the head by a cobblestone; he fell into a river and was saved by the skin of his teeth.</p>
<p>"<em>He's a child condemned to misfortune; he won't live," his mother said. In the district, they called him "little Sax, the ghost</em>".</p>
<p>These initial serious incidents were, alas, but the prelude to an eventful existence such as only a few have known. In 1858, Adolphe Sax was miraculously saved from a cancer of the lip by a black doctor who knew the properties of certain Indian plants. What would the future have been but for this intervention?</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Charles-Joseph"></a>
<h2><span>Charles-Joseph Sax</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A joiner-cabinetmaker, Charles-Joseph Sax quickly launched himself, with success, into the manufacture of musical instruments. In the "New Street" he ran a large workshop. In this trade, he acquired such a reputation that, in 1815 (his eldest son was only one year old), he also set up a workshop in Brussels (where Antoine-Joseph's brothers and sisters were to be born), where he was summoned by William I of Orange (we were then under Dutch occupation). The latter appointed him as maker to the Court and entrusted him with the task of supplying suitable instruments to Belgium regimental music corps.</p>
<p>A self-taught man, therefore, Charles-Joseph Sax made woodwind and brass instruments, even violins and pianos. He registered a dozen patents and brought his instruments to perfection. He successfully participated in numerous exhibitions, where he was awarded flattering distinctions.</p>
<p>At the time when he could have spend the day playing, laughing and having fun, Antoine-Joseph observed the work in his father's workshop, besides being given instruction by one of his uncles, a teacher in Dinant. He was intelligent and his inventive mind was already showing itself, thanks to his love for music (whilst very young, he took singing and flute lessons). Thereafter, he was given lessons by his father, who quickly appreciated his abilities and did all he could to develop them.</p>
<p>Far from disregarding his son's aspirations, Charles-Joseph Sax made him his apprentice and, from a young age, he was conscious of the importance of his work, as though he were anticipating his destiny.</p>
<p>In 1853, after the death of seven of his eleven children, and following financial worries at his Brussels business, Charles-Joseph joined his son in Paris. The master was to become the servant, and was from then on in charge of making saxophones until his death in 1865.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Jeunesse"></a>
<h2><span>A productive childhood</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Supported and assisted by his father, the youth worked. He created, he perfected instruments and he played them. He was 16 when he went to the Industrial Exposition in Brussels to present flutes and ivory clarinets. At the age of 20, he made an entirely new clarinet, with 24 keys, a work of imagination and a masterpiece of manual work. Then, a new bass clarinet, which incited enthusiasm in Habeneck, the leader of the orchestra at the Paris Opera House, who was passing through Brussels, and who called the other clarinets "barbarian instruments".</p>
<p>Even at that early stage, this creation provoked jealousy in the soloist at the "Great Royal Harmony" in Brussels, who refused to use it because, he said, it had come from "that weedy little pupil, Sax". "Play your clarinet, then" Sax answered, " and I shall play mine." The challenge accepted, Sax triumphed in front of four thousand people. He became a soloist. Works were written for him that, after his departure, were no longer played because they were so difficult!</p>
<p>The young genius pursued his work. He invented a sound reflector, a new double-bass clarinet, a piano-tuning process that remained the inventor's secret and who probably was unable to exploit it for want of money, a steam organ "capable of being heard throughout the province": now that just shows Sax's tendency to think big!</p>
<p>Sax's beginnings throw a very curious light on his character (we shall call him Adolphe from now on): energy, courage, dynamism, total self-confidence. He refused to go and set up a business in St Petersburg, rejected an offer to set up in London. That means that his reputation exceeded frontiers. Sax was conscious of all his possibilities and his talent; he conceived the work that he felt the call to achieve; he was full of hope and he believed he had every chance of success; he had great visions, he believed in what he saw. He suffocated in his little country.</p>
<p>In 1840, he presented nine inventions at the Belgian Exhibition. He was denied the first medal on the plea of his young age; there would be nothing left to offer him the year after. He was thwarted in his true-love, if not in his pride. He refused the vermeil medal he was awarded, replying with pride, "<em>If they think me too young to deserve the gold medal, I myself think me too old to accept this vermeil one</em>."</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="Paris"></a>
<h2><span>The Call to Paris</span></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Europe's centre of attraction, Paris haunted him, Paris called him.</p>
<p>The composer Halévy wrote to him of the hope that composers had in his inventions: "<em>Hurry and finish your new family of instruments (saxophones) and come and succour to the poor composers that are looking for something new and to the public that is demanding it, if not to the world itself.</em>"</p>
<p>Let us add to this call and the snub in Brussels the fact of his family trials, and the decision was made: Adolphe Sax left for Paris "rich in ideas and light in cash": he had thirty francs in his pocket!</p>
<p>The year 1842 formed the turning point in Sax's life, possessing as he did his new invention: the saxophone and its family.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dinant.be/uploads/pages/286/sax_atel.jpg" alt="">Moreover, in 1841, had he not presented it anonymously in Brussels, behind a curtain, so as not to disclose it and avoid the risk of plagiarism?</p>
<p>Adolphe Sax was almost thirty, "the age at which man's creative character affirms itself, at which the human personality is drawn." At the age of 27, Napoleon won his first battle in Italy; Newton was 24 and Einstein 26 when they devised their theories. Mozart died aged 35 and Schubert at 31. Examples of precocious geniuses are manifold.</p>
<p>As one former inhabitant of Dinant once rightfully said (1) "<em>a distinction has to be drawn here between a man who draws from his own abstract thoughts the stuff that his genius will knead, him for whom symbols and signs are sufficient to bring forth a thought laden with restrained life and latent splendours; and the other man for whom a technique, slow and tenacious apprenticeship on a complicated apparatus is necessary for him to be able to physically achieve the formal idea. Count, for example, how many early-developing mathematicians there are compared with child physicists. The former exist, the latter are nowhere to be found. Sax is of the category of intellectuals that concentrated on matter and not pure form"</em>.</p>
<p>In 1842, there was Adolphe Sax living in a simple shed in Rue Saint-Georges, Paris. To set up business, he had to borrow money from a musician acquaintance.</p>

</blockquote>
<a name="Berlioz"></a>
<h2><span>Thanks to Berlioz</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p><span><strong>About the saxophone, he said "<em>Its principal merit in my view is the varied beauty of its accent, sometimes serious, sometimes calm, sometimes impassioned, dreamy or melancholic, or vague, like the weakened echo of an echo, like the indistinct plaintiff moans of the breeze in the woods and, even better, like the mysterious vibrations of a bell, long after it has been struck; there does not exist another musical instrument …</em></strong></span></p></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p>This starts the server on port 1234. then players can connect to it with any tool that does tcp sockets. For example netcat:</p>

<p>For an improved experience you can use <code>rlwrap nc</code> instead to don't have incoming messages mess up your input</p>
<h3 id="joining-the-game"><a href="#joining-the-game" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>Joining the game</h3>
<p>Players can only join while the game is in the pre-game lobby state. People are asked for a name and then end up in the lobby chat. One player is the admin, usually the first person to connect. That person can execute the /start command to start round. Other chat commands are described in /help</p>
<p>After starting the round one of the players is assigned the imposter role, all other players are assigned the crewmate role. After that the game moves to the playing state</p>
<h3 id="the-playing-stage"><a href="#the-playing-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The playing stage</h3>
<p>In the playing state the players get a <code>#</code> prompt. At this point people can't chat to eachother anymore and can only run commands (without / prefix)</p>
<p>Everyone starts in the cafeteria, everyone gets 7 tasks randomly assigned. You can check your tasks with the <code>check tasks</code> command. You complete your tasks by moving to the room the task is in and typing the full task name, this is case sensitive.</p>
<p>You can see the room you're in by running the <code>examine room</code> or <code>e</code> command. This will also show you where you can move to from the current room and which crewmates are in the room with you. You can move to other rooms by using the <code>go [roomname]</code> command.</p>
<p>The <code>map</code> command shows an ascii art diagram of the map as reference.</p>
<p>If you are the imposter your main mission is not to complete the tasks but to murder all the crew without anyone figuring out you're the imposter. You can use the <code>murder crewmate</code> command to kill a crewmate that's in the same room as you. If there are multiple one will be chosen at random and the other crewmates will be notified someone died in the room with them.</p>
<p>If somebody notices a dead body in the room they can use the <code>report</code> command to halt the playing and move everyone to the discussion stage. It is also possible to trigger the discussion stage by going to the cafeteria and using the <code>press emergency button</code> command.</p>
<h3 id="the-discussion-stage"><a href="#the-discussion-stage" rel="nofollow noopener">#</a>The discussion stage</h3>
<p>If a body has been found or a meeting has been called everyone gets thrown in the discussion state. At this point everyone can see who is still alive. Then there's a chatroom which is limited to 50 messages in total, so use the chat wisely. While/after chatting it is possible to either vote to throw someone off the ship or to skip using <code>/vote [number]</code> or <code>/skip</code>. You can also use <code>/list</code> to see who has not voted yet.</p>
<p>After everyone has voted either the game moves directly back to the playing stage or someone gets thrown off. After the player has been ejected it will be visible if it was the imposter (and then the game has been won by the crew) or if someone innocent was ejected. Then the game moves back to the playing stage.</p>
<p>The crew can win by having everyone complete all the tasks or by voting out the imposter. The imposter can win by killing all the crew or by making the crew vote out all their crewmates.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                
<audio controls="controls"><source src="https://azumbrunnen.me/audio/chatbot-is-dead" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>



<p>Personal websites are usually like old books in a shelf. They languish, accumulate dust, and their wrinkles and cracks become more apparent over time. About 3 years ago I embarked on a simple experiment that would end up prolonging the shelf-life of my website by an unusually large margin.</p>



<p>Back in 2017, it seemed like Conversational UI was poised to take over the world. We saw Quartz turning news into a conversation, WeChat being featured as the poster-child of a post application world, iMessage turning into an unnecessarily complex mess, and chatbots popping up like mushrooms in moist forests.</p>



<p>Of course, any trend gaining so much traction and interest needs to be taken seriously. As such, I decided to familiarize myself with the topic, and turned my website into a chatbot.</p>



<p>Instead of being greeted by the internationally standardized greeting every designer used at some point in their career, there was no bold, dramatically oversized, and deep black sans-serif reading: <em>Hi, I’m a designer.</em> (To be fair, I didn’t use Proxima Nova either)</p>



<p>Instead, a couple of chat bubbles exuberantly ushered onto the canvas to greet users as if we had all been long time friends.</p>



<figure><video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/chatbot-animated.mp4" playsinline=""></video><figcaption>Conversational intro</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was witty, new, and slightly awkward. People would send messages that ranged from simple chit chat, to deep philosophical topics, to downright disturbing and ridiculous insults.</p>



<p>The experiment got featured on Hackernews, Medium, was used in psychological studies conducted by Dan Ariely’s team, and the source code was ripped and edited by various startups to fit their needs. One business in the Bay Area had an idea to use it to sell flowers in a conversational way. It looks like they went out of business.</p>



<p>The reaction and feedback was surprising to say the least. It was an idea so simple, so silly, that the outcome was in many ways unexpected. After all, the only one who really cares about your website, is usually yourself.</p>



<p>That didn’t stop me from revamping my website and kill the very thing that had turned it into a micro-celebrity before. With the death of my old chatbot, some angry emails by schools who are using it as a reference for “creative” web design, and a good amount of time that has passed ever since, I wanted to take a step back and set the record straight.</p>



<hr>



<h2>When chatbots matter</h2>



<p>So let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment: <em>when did you actually ever enjoy talking to a chat bot?</em> And I’m not talking about the type of bots you talk to when you’re bored, but about those that provide a deeper purpose.</p>



<p>It turns out that the answer is, at least for most of us, almost never.</p>



<p>I love you Intercom, except when I don’t. 99% of time I don’t want to talk to a silly and obtrusive avatar popping up from some corner of the screen before I even had a chance to check out what’s going on. Somehow, I can’t help but think others feel the same.</p>



<p>In fact, we do know that others feel the same. Chat heads jumping at us unasked, are the quintessential equivalent of the infamous sales clerk who eagerly talks to us upon entering a store.</p>



<p>To further add to the challenges: as soon as users go off-script, chat bot’s don’t just become awkward and unpredictable—they turn into little sociopaths that might rub users the wrong way.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="346" src="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png" alt="" srcset="https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma.png 400w, https://azumbrunnen.me/wp-content/uploads/grandma-300x260.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><figcaption>UX Chat.me —&nbsp;Conversational UX News</figcaption></figure>



<p>The moment you create a chat bot is the moment you allow customers to have a conversation with <em>your brand</em>. Not with yourself, not with your friend, but with an uber entity—a symbol—that represents everything you and your team stand for. That’s not a step to be taken lightly.</p>



<p>This simple conversational entity can be a fun tool to engage with people but depending on how the conversation goes, it can quickly turn into a misrepresentation of the values of your team and your company. So building a chat bot should never be the default choice, but an intentional one.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s worth asking yourself the following three questions before venturing into this space:</p>



<h3>1. Is your use case simple enough to be solved through chat?</h3>



<p>Conversation is incredibly complex and it’s challenging enough to keep it on track in the real world. If the use case isn’t simple, chances are, chat bots are not the right tool for the job.</p>



<h3>2. Is your NLP capable and sophisticated enough?</h3>



<p>There are two types of bots: pre-scripted bots with a range of default answers users can choose from, and Natural Language Processing based ones.</p>



<p>Choosing the right one is hard. While pre-scripted can feel too limiting, NLP can break at every corner. Often times, teams quickly fall into the trap of spending a huge amount of time focusing on personality and silly jokes, instead of solving the problem users hired you for in the first place.</p>



<p>Therefore, building on top of the first point above, within the conversational landscape, simple always wins.</p>



<h3>3. Are your users actually in chat based environments?</h3>



<p>Chat bots work best where users already are. If your users are primarily spending time in messaging platforms where bots and micro-apps can be seamlessly embedded, great. That can serve as an effective and natural way to engage with your audience because it matches the “be where users already are” principle.</p>



<p>If on the other hand, people come to your website, a medium that has made great strides to provide content in a non-linear and quick way, it often unnecessarily slows users down. </p>



<hr>



<h2>Farewell chatbot</h2>



<p>I don’t want to discredit chat bots as a paradigm. They have their use in certain industries, medium, and work well for a specific set of use cases. The important part is being deliberate, rather than jumping ship blindfolded.</p>



<p>So whereas turning my website into a chat was a fun experiment, I ultimately feel like it has slowly turned into a fad. I got fooled by the trend, and as a by-product became part of the trend itself.  Fads come and go, and as they get refined and re-interpreted, they ultimately find their true purpose. What we’re left with is the age old insight that it’s only through experimentation, that we can unlock concepts and ideas that last.</p>



<p>Rest in peace chat bot, long live chat bots.</p>

        <p>A survey conducted by u/PM_ME__UR_CANCER</p>
        <p><img src="https://747anon.github.io/blm-survey/img/github.png" width="200px" alt="Github"></p>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div><p>
                Hello!

                These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
                thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
                to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

                The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
                and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
                innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
                
                </p><p>
                This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
                'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
                more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
                distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
                and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
                it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
                branch's purpose more clearly.

                </p><p>
                In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
                the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
                in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.

                The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
                ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
                However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
                was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
                science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
                disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

                Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
                European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
                responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
                countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
                countries in the list.

                The general opinion for most users is that they are <b>against</b> this change. 70% of all participants said
                that they are against the change, with only 15.7% being in support of the change. The other 14.3% fall under
                'Maybe' and 'Don't care', though their actual opinions are usually mixed and lean towards one of the two main
                options. Based on the written responses from users who were asked to explain their responses, most reasoning
                for their responses is as follows:
                </p><p>
                <b>For</b></p></div><ul>
                    <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                        a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                        It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                        would make much more sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                        it would simply be impractical.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                        changing it to something else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Against</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                        to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                        comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                        understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                        automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                        'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                        associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                    <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                        is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
                given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
                of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
            
                <p>
                However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
                offend certain people, is confusing and unclear in its meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
                swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

                </p><p>
                Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
                preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
                by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.

            <h2>Correlations</h2>
            <p>
                I originally ran this survey with the goal of discovering some kind of correlation between the different demographic
                groups which make up Github's user base, and how positive/negative their support is in relation to this issue. I also
                wanted to see which group was most supportive of the change, which group was least supportive, and how much the 
                response changed between ethnicities, genders and countries.

                Something I was not expecting when gathering the data for this survey is that every single African American who
                answered the survey responded 'No' in support of the change. Not only that, when asked to explain their reasoning,
                all of them sounded fairly spiteful towards Github and it's executives, since they felt that these decisions were
                made by white executives who didn't actually consider whether it offended them or not, and these responses suggest
                that they were more offended by Github feeling the need to change it in the first place.
                
                </p><p>
                You can also see that most of the users in support of this change are of either caucasian or asian descent, while
                more marginalised groups like africans, indians, hispanics and otherwise are almost universally against the changes,
                reflecting that the main ethnic group which feels the need to change it (and take offense to it) are white.

<p><strong>In the first of the “Hitchhiker’s Guide to DRM” series, we define</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>what DRM (Digital Rights Management) is,</strong></li><li><strong>and why it plays an important role in ensuring fair use of digital resources through a combination of encryption, access control technology, and business rules.</strong></li></ul>








<h2><span id="The_Tale_of_Two_Boys"></span>The Tale of Two Boys<span></span></h2>



<p>Ram and Shyam were 7th graders who loved passing notes to each other during class. An inseparable duo, their notes contained the latest school gossip, computer game cheat codes, and cricket match scores.</p>



<p>Their notes used to pass through several of their classmates’ hands in their journey because they sat far away from each other in class. But, the boys weren’t worried about others learning their secrets because they trusted their classmates.</p>



<p>However, one sad day, one of their classmates opened one of their notes and broke their trust!! Delighted by the juicy gossip in the note, he used it to take Ram and Shyam’s lunch money.</p>

<p>Having lost all of his lunch money, Ram thought long and hard about sending his notes securely to Shyam and before long, Ram had an idea.</p>



<p>“How about using a code language to write my notes?”</p>



<p>Excellent idea, he thought to himself and set about creating a substitution code (1 for A, 2 for B, and so on). The following day in class, Ram used his new code language to write a secret message and send it to Shyam.</p>



<p>The note made its way to Shyam through the hands of several curious (&amp; nosy) classmates, and none of them could crack the code.</p>



<p>But, when Shyam got the message, he looked perplexed and thought to himself –</p>



<blockquote><p>What are these numbers, squiggly lines, and alphabets? Is Ram testing his new pen, or was he hit on the head with a cricket ball?</p></blockquote>



<p>Ram stared at Shyam’s puzzled face with equal bewilderment and suddenly realized his mistake. He had forgotten to send Shyam the key to the code!</p>



<p>So, Ram wrote down the code on a piece of paper and sent it to Shyam, who used it to decode the note.</p>



<p>Job well done, Ram thought to himself.</p>



<p>They didn’t know that one of their classmates had copied down the coded message and now had the codebook. For the second day in a row, Ram and Shyam lost their secrets and their lunch money.</p>



<p>They realized that they needed to transmit the code securely each time they used code or changed it.</p>



<p><strong>But how would they do that?</strong></p>



<h2 id="what-did-ram--shyam-do"><span id="What_Did_Ram_Shyam_Do"></span>What Did Ram &amp; Shyam Do?<span></span></h2>



<p><strong><em>Narrator:</em></strong>&nbsp;<em>The problem faced by the boys is a classic problem in data transmission. It is easy to use a codebook, create a secret message, and send it to the recipient but, how do you send the codebook to the recipient and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands?</em></p>



<p>Then one night, Shyam had a brainwave. He called Ram and said –</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – suppose we ask Hari to join us in note passing? We’ll ask him to keep the codebook safe in his schoolbag. Each time you or I need to write or read a message, we’ll ask Hari for the codebook. What do you think?</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Hey – that could work! But, will Hari agree to this?</p>



<p><strong>Shyam:</strong>&nbsp;Yea – I thought of that too. Every time we ask him for the codebook, let’s give him a chocolate.</p>



<p><strong>Ram:</strong>&nbsp;Ah – excellent idea!</p>

<p><strong>Narrator:</strong>&nbsp;So, the boys decided to bring in their friend Hari into their plans and asked him to be a “trusted” third-party. And, his duties were to –</p>



<ol><li>invent a new code every day to reduce chances of someone cracking it and</li><li>provide the code’s key to only Ram and Shyam in a way that nobody else can open and read it.</li></ol>



<p><strong>And the boys had to give him a bar of chocolate each time they asked for the codebook.</strong></p>



<p>Yummy price to pay for privacy, huh?</p>



<h2 id="digital-rights-management-drm"><span id="Digital_Rights_Management_(DRM)"></span>Digital Rights Management (DRM)<span></span></h2>



<p>In reality, what our creative 7th graders invented was a Digital Rights Management (DRM) system that not only provided security for their content (notes) but also allowed them to set some rules.</p>



<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a method of protecting your content while having the flexibility to chose who gets to consume it via business rules and a secure, protected communication protocol.</p>



<p>For example, you could set rules to,</p>



<ul><li>block people from certain countries,</li><li>allow access to the content for a certain period,</li><li>prevent a user from casting the movie onto a screen,</li><li>block free users from accessing premium content,</li><li>block playback on specific devices,</li><li>etc.</li></ul>



<p>DRM plays a vital role in reducing piracy and ensuring that content creators can monetize their efforts.</p>



<p>But, remember this –&nbsp;<strong>DRM is not the same as encryption</strong>.</p>



<p>DRM is a system or solution that</p>



<ul><li>uses encryption to protect the content</li><li>uses specialized techniques to <strong>securely store and deliver</strong> the encryption/decryption keys&nbsp;<em>(codebooks in our 7th graders’ example)</em> and use the keys to decrypt the content in a way that it doesn’t get into the wrong hands. </li><li>allows the content publishers to set business rules and control who can consume their content (expiry times, etc.).</li></ul>



<p>We’ll learn more about this in future articles.</p>



<h2 id="back-to-our-7th-graders"><span id="Back_to_Our_7th_Graders"></span>Back to Our 7th Graders<span></span></h2>



<p>Now let’s go back and look at the simple solution that our 7th graders invented, which provided</p>



<ul><li>a high-security level through daily renewal and code rotation.</li><li>authentication and rights management (read, write permissions)</li><li>a well-defined pricing model.</li></ul>



<p>The truly remarkable part about this scheme is that as Ram and Shyam get more popular in school, they can allow a few other classmates to only “read” their messages and not “write” any messages.</p>



<p>All they’d need to do is go to Hari, give him the names and photos of their “newly trusted” friends, and ask Hari to allow them only to read the messages.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>if</strong>&nbsp;the boys’ messages get super-popular, they can ask Hari to</p>



<ul><li>block or allow access to classmates based on where they sit in class:&nbsp;<em>front-benchers not allowed</em>&nbsp;<strong>(geo-blocking)</strong></li><li>Create a set of special notes and charge their classmates two chocolates to read them. All they need to do is tell Hari their subscribers’ names.&nbsp;<strong>(paid usage / subscribers / freemium model)</strong></li><li>deny access to messages that are more than 2 hours old (stale news!)&nbsp;<strong>(expiry date &amp; time of day restriction)</strong></li></ul>



<p>And so on. Amazing, right?</p>



<p>A simple technique to prevent others from reading their messages has now turned into a full-blown business with</p>



<ul><li>heavy-duty encryption and</li><li>business rules that decide access and usage rights.</li></ul>



<h2 id="commercial-drm-solutions"><span id="Commercial_DRM_Solutions"></span>Commercial DRM Solutions<span></span></h2>



<p>Commercially, there are many trusted DRM technologies such as Microsoft’s PlayReady, Google’s Widevine, and Apple’s FairPlay. And there are DRM vendors who provide additional infrastructure around these DRM solutions by adding more business rules, analytics, and tools for publishers.</p>



<p>In future articles, we’ll examine the differences between them and see where they are applicable.</p>



<p>Until then, take care, and see you soon!</p>



<p><strong>Note: DRM is seen as a contentious topic with people on both sides of the fence. This series of articles is a technology-explainer and stays clear of the other debates on DRM.</strong></p>

            <section>
                <p>Today at <a href="https://cg.ivd.kit.edu/egsr18/">EGSR 2018</a>, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced the release of two large, production quality/scale data sets for rendering research purposes.
The data sets are available on a new <a href="https://disneyanimation.com/data-sets/">data sets page on the official Disney Animation website</a>.
The first data set is the Cloud Data Set, which contains a large and highly detailed volumetric cloud data set that we used for our “<a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2017/07/spectral-and-decomposition-tracking.html">Spectral and Decomposition Tracking for Rendering Heterogeneous Volumes</a>” SIGGRAPH 2017 paper, and the second data set is the Moana Island Scene, which is a full production scene from <a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/2016/11/moana.html">Moana</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/shotCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/shotCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 1: The Moana Island Data Set, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/wdas_cloud_hyperion_render.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/wdas_cloud_hyperion_render.jpg" alt="Figure 2: The Cloud Data Set, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share some personal thoughts, observations, and notes.
The release of these data sets was announced by my teammate, Ralf Habel, at EGSR today, but this release has been in the works for a very long time now, and is the product of the collective effort of an enormous number of people across the studio.
A number of people deserve to be highlighted: Rasmus Tamstorf spearheaded the entire effort and was instrumental in getting the resources and legal approval needed for the Moana Island Scene.
Heather Pritchett is the TD that did the actual difficult work of extracting the Moana Island Scene out of Disney Animation’s production pipeline and converting it from proprietary data formats into usable, industry-standard data formats.
Sean Palmer and Jonathan Garcia also helped in resurrecting the data from Moana.
Hyperion developers Ralf Habel and Peter Kutz led the effort to get the Cloud Data Set approved and released; the cloud itself was made by artists Henrik Falt and Alex Nijmeh.
On the management side of things, technology manager Rajesh Sharma and Disney Animation CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/ncannon?lang=en">Nick Cannon</a>, provided crucial support and encouragement.
Matt Pharr has been crucial in collaborating with us to get these data sets released.
Matt was highly accommodating in helping us get the Moana Island Scene into a PBRT scene; I’ll talk a bit more about this later.
Intel’s Embree team also gave significant feedback.
My role was actually quite small; along with other members of the Hyperion development team, I just provided some consultation throughout the whole process.</p>

<p>Please note the licenses that the data sets come with.
The Cloud Data Set is licensed under a <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/6/asset/License_Cloud.pdf">Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>; the actual cloud is based on a photograph by Kevin Udy on his <a href="https://coclouds.com/436/cumulus/%202012-07-26/">Colorado Clouds Blog</a>, which is also licensed under the same Creative Commons license.
The Moana Island Scene is licensed under a more restrictive, custom Disney Enterprises <a href="https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/production/data_set_asset/4/asset/License_Moana.pdf">research license</a>.
This is because the Moana Island Scene is a true production scene; it was actually used to produce actual frames in the final film.
As such, the data set is being released only for pure research and development purposes; it’s not meant for use in artistic projects.
Please stick to and follow the licenses these data sets are released under; if people end up misusing these data sets, then it makes releasing more data sets into the community in the future much harder for us.</p>

<p>This entire effort was sparked two years ago at SIGGRAPH 2016, when Matt Pharr made an appeal to the industry to provide representative production-scale data sets to the research community.
I don’t know how many times I’ve had conversations about how well new techniques or papers or technologies will scale to production cases, only to have further discussion stymied by the lack of any true production data sets that the research community can test against.
We decided as a studio to answer Matt’s appeal, and last year at SIGGRAPH 2017, Brent Burley and Rasmus Tamstorf announced our intention to release both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets.
It’s taken nearly a year from announcement to release because the process has been complex, and it was very important to the studio to make sure the release was done properly.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges was getting all of the data out of the production pipeline and our various proprietary data formats into something that the research community can actually parse and make use of.
Matt Pharr was extremely helpful here; over the past year, Matt has added support for <a href="http://ptex.us/">Ptex</a> textures and implemented the <a href="http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2015-shading-course/burley/s2015_pbs_disney_bsdf_notes.pdf">Disney Bsdf</a> in <a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3">PBRT v3</a>.
Having Ptex and the Disney Bsdf available in PBRT v3 made PBRT v3 the natural target for an initial port to a renderer other than Hyperion, since internally all of Hyperion’s shading uses the Disney Bsdf, and all of our texturing is done through Ptex.
Our texturing also relies heavily on procedural <a href="https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/seexpr.html">SeExpr</a> expressions; all of the expression-drive texturing had to be baked down into Ptex for the final release.</p>

<p>Both the Cloud and Moana Island data sets are, quite frankly, enormous.
The Cloud data set contains a single OpenVDB cloud that weighs in at 2.93 GB; the data set also provides versions of the VDB file scaled down to half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth scale resolutions.
The Moana Island data set comes in three parts: a base package containing raw geometry and texture data, an animation package containing animated stuff, and a PBRT package containing a PBRT scene generated from the base package.
These three packages combined, uncompressed, weigh in at well over 200 GB of disk space; the uncompressed PBRT package along weighs in at around 38 GB.</p>

<p>For the Moana Island Scene, the provided PBRT scene requires a minimum of around 90 GB if RAM to render.
This many seem enormous for consumer machines, because it is.
However, this is also what we mean by “production scale”; for Disney Animation, 90 GB is actually a fairly mid-range memory footprint for a production render.
On a 24-core, dual-socket Intel Xeon Gold 6136 system, the PBRT scene took me a little over an hour and 15 minutes to render from the ‘shotCam’ camera.
Hyperion renders the scene faster, but I would caution against using this data set to do performance shootouts between different renders.
I’m certain that within a short period of time, enthusiastic members of the rendering community will end up porting this scene to Renderman and Arnold and Vray and Cycles and every other production renderer out there, which will be very cool!
But keep in mind, this data set was authored very specifically around Hyperion’s various capabilities and constraints, which naturally will be very different from how one might author a complex data set for other renderers.
Every renderer works a bit differently, so the most optimal way to author a data set for every renderer will be a bit different; this data set is no exception.
So if you want to compare renderers using this data set, make sure you understand the various ways how the way this data set is structured impacts the performance of whatever renderers you are comparing.</p>

<p>For example, Hyperion subdivides/tessellates/displaces everything to as close to sub-poly-per-pixel as it can get while still fitting within computational resources.
This means our scenes are usually very heavily subdivided and tessellated.
However, the PBRT version of the scene doesn’t come with any subdivision; as a result, silhouettes in the following comparison images don’t fully match in some areas.
Similarly, PBRT’s lights and lighting model differ from Hyperion’s, and Hyperion has various artistic controls that are unique to Hyperion, meaning the renders produced by PBRT versus Hyperion differ in many ways:</p>

Some of the plants are in slightly different locations than the Hyperion render; this was just a small change that happened in data conversion to the PBRT scene."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/flowersCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/flowersCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 6a: 'flowersCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

Note that the silhouette of the flowers is different compared to the Hyperion render because the Hyperion render subdivides the flowers, whereas the PBRT render displays the base cage."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/grassCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/grassCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 7a: 'grassCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

The sand dune in the background looks particularly different from the Hyperion render due to subdivision and displacement."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 8a: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/palmsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/palmsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 8b: 'palmsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. The palm leaves look especially different due to differences in artistic lighting shaping and curve shading differences. Most notably, the look in Hyperion depends heavily on attributes that vary along the length of the curve, which is something PBRT doesn't support yet. Some more work is needed here to get the palm leaves to look more similar between the two renders."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_hyperion.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_hyperion.jpg" alt="Figure 9a: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using Disney's Hyperion Renderer."></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/rootsCam_pbrt.png"><img src="https://blog.yiningkarlli.com/content/images/2018/Jul/preview/rootsCam_pbrt.jpg" alt="Figure 9b: 'rootsCam' camera angle, rendered using PBRT v3. Again, the significant difference in appearance in the rocks is probably just due to subdivision/tesselation/displacement."></a></p>

<p>Another example of a major difference between the Hyperion renders and the PBRT renders is in the water, which Hyperion renders using photon mapping to get the caustics.
The provided PBRT scenes use unidirectional pathtracing for everything including the water, hence the very different caustics.
Similarly, the palm trees in the ‘palmsCam’ camera angle look very different between PBRT and Hyperion because Hyperion’s lighting controls are very different from PBRT; Hyperion’s lights include various artistic controls for custom shaping and whatnot, which aren’t necessarily fully physical.
Also, the palm leaves are modeled using curves, and the shading depends on varying colors and attributes along the length and width of the curve, which PBRT doesn’t support yet (getting the palm leaves is actually the top priority for if more resources are freed up to improve the data set release).
These difference between renderers don’t necessarily mean that one renderer is better than the other; they simply mean that the renderers are different.
This will be true for any pair of renderers that one wants to compare.</p>

<p>The Cloud Data Set includes an example render from Hyperion, which implements our Spectral and Decomposition Tracking paper in its volumetric rendering system to efficiently render the cloud with thousands of bounces.
This render contains no post-processing; what you see in the provided image is exactly what Hyperion outputs.
The VDB file expresses the cloud as a field of heterogeneous densities.
Also provided is an example <a href="https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/">Mitsuba</a> scene, renderable using the <a href="https://github.com/zhoub/mitsuba-vdb">Mitsuba-VDB plugin that can be found on Github</a>.
Please consult the README file for some modifications in Mitsuba that are necessary to render the cloud.
Also, please note that the Mitsuba example will take an extremely long time to render, since Mitsuba isn’t really meant to render high-albedo heterogeneous volumes.
With proper acceleration structures and algorithms, rendering the cloud only takes us a few minutes using Hyperion, and should be similarly fast in any modern production renderer.</p>

<p>One might wonder just why production data sets in general are so large.
This is an interesting question; the short answer across the industry basically boils down to “artist time is more expensive and valuable than computer hardware”.
We could get these scenes to fit into much smaller …</p></section></article></div></div>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" alt="thumbnails ffmpeg" title="thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/thumbnails-ffmpeg-featured-image.png?resize=678%2C381&amp;ssl=1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==">
</figure>


<p>There are several easy ways to take screenshots/thumbnails of movies using FFmpeg. But why do this in the first place?</p>



<ol><li>You might want to generate thumbnails for your videos and show those thumbnails to the user when he scrolls through the video. </li><li>Or, you might want to compare two videos by doing a side-by-side comparison – this is quite common in video compression research. </li></ol>



<p>FFmpeg offers very simple techniques to extract screenshots or thumbnails at any position of the video (or rather, a way to dump frames at any point you choose). </p>



<p>Let’s see how! </p>




<h2><span id="Single_Screenshot/Thumbnail_Using_frames_v"></span>Single Screenshot/Thumbnail Using <code>-frames:v</code><span></span></h2>



<p>First, let’s understand how to take a single screenshot or thumbnail using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -ss 00:00:03 -frames:v 1 foobar.jpeg</code></pre>



<p>Understanding this is very simple! Here goes – </p>



<ol><li><code>-ss</code> is the seek command and it can be used to seek to the right position. For accurate seeking, you need to use output seeking and not input seeking (i.e., putting <code>-ss</code> before the input sequence). The syntax for specifying the time is <code>HH:MM:SS.MILLISECONDS</code>. For example, you can tell FFmpeg to seek to&nbsp;<code>01:02:03</code>&nbsp;– i.e., the 3rd second of the 2nd minute of the 1 hour of the movie!</li><li><code>-frames:v 1</code> tells FFmpeg to take only 1 screenshot. Note that, <code>-vframes</code> is deprecated. </li><li>then, you mention the name of the output file (<code>screenshot_10.jpg</code>). </li></ol>



<p>Simple, wasn’t it? Now that you know how to produce a single thumbnail or screenshot, let’s move to the next section where we understand how to create regular or periodic thumbnails.</p>



<h2><span id="Periodic_Screenshot/Thumbnail_with_Resizing"></span>Periodic Screenshot/Thumbnail with Resizing<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is another common use case that FFmpeg can solve easily – <strong>how do you take screenshots/thumbnails at regular intervals, and store them to JPG files after resizing them?</strong></p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that can take care of creating a thumbnail and resizing it for you. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input1080p.mp4 -r 1 -s 1280x720 -f image2 screenshot-%03d.jpg</code></pre>



<p>The <code>-r</code> command sets the output frame rate (=1) and <code>image2</code> is an image file muxer that is used to write video frames to image files. Using the <code>-s 1280x720</code> command, we can resize the video frames before writing them as images. Note, that the input video is a 1920x1080p video.</p>



<p>The above command will take a screenshot every 1 second. The screenshots would be named <code>001</code>, <code>002</code>, etc. because we have specified the formatting as <code>%3d</code>.</p>



<p>However, in my experience, I have found this technique<strong> to be not frame-accurate</strong>.</p>



<p>In the next section, let’s look at a more accurate way of extracting thumbnails. </p>



<h2><span id="Screenshot/Thumbnail_every_10_seconds"></span>Screenshot/Thumbnail every 10 seconds<span></span></h2>



<p>As an extension of the previous section, let’s do a quick exercise and learn how to create a thumbnail every 10 seconds using FFmpeg. </p>



<pre><code><code>ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 -vf "select='not(mod(n,300))',setpts='N/(30*TB)'" -f image2 thumbnail%03d.jpg</code></code></pre>



<p>Here, </p>



<ol><li>we use the <code>select</code> filter to extract a frame if the expression in single-quotes evaluates to non-zero. If the expression is zero, then <code>select</code> filter discards that frame.</li><li><code>mod(A,B)</code>&nbsp;returns the modulus (remainder after division) result after dividing A by B. So, if we divide 0 by 300, we get 0. Then, 1/300 is 1, and so on. </li><li><code>not</code> inverts this result. So, if the modulus is zero, then the final result is <code>1</code>. If the modulus is non-zero, then the result is evaluated to <code>zero</code>. </li><li>Based on this <code>not</code> operation, the <code>select</code> filter picks up a frame. </li></ol>



<p>The sequence I am using has a frame-rate of <code>30 fps</code>. And, I want a frame every 10 seconds. So, I have to choose a frame out of every 300 frames, right? That is why I used <code>select='not(mod(n,300))'</code></p>







<p>Depending on your sequence’s frame-rate, you can modify the command line shown. If you don’t know your video’s frame-rate, you can use <code>ffprobe</code> to find out. </p>



<pre><code>ffprobe -show_entries format=duration globe-with-timestamp.mp4</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>There you have it – multiple easy ways to generate thumbnails and screenshots using FFmpeg. You can choose to take single screenshots or periodic ones with a highly frame-accurate technique! </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p><i>After every crisis, some of the uncertainty becomes a part of our new reality. How, then, do you adapt and thrive when change is not a choice but inevitability? Let’s see.</i></p><p>Can you believe that Netflix is over two decades old?</p><p>The company has responded to changes (dot-com crash, global financial crisis, COVID-19) in a manner that in every period it seemed it belonged to those times, and sometimes even ahead of them. This once exclusively DVD-by-mail company started to build a streaming service in the early 2000s when most homes didn’t even have internet with enough bandwidth. Anticipating a shift in technology it sensed well in-advance how the consumption of media would change. The results? It has grown from 10m subscribers in 2010 to more than 160m in 2020.</p><p>We are good at finding solutions for today, but when it comes to the future, it’s human nature to see things in a state of positive permanence. Instinctively we tend to underestimate the likelihood of negative events. And this makes us not so good at preparing for uncertainty, much less manage it.</p><p>Successful businesses prepare for the unknown and use uncertain times as a chance to rethink their working norms. The throes of COVID-19 have sent a reminder for business leaders that continual re-examination of ongoing practices and assumptions is paramount.</p><p><b>Here’s a guide to help business strategists act amid uncertainty – and leverage the times to up their adaptability quotient and position themselves for success. </b></p><h4>Resilience: An Antidote for Business Uncertainty</h4><p>Uncertainty brings outcomes we never predicted or saw coming – whether it be a fire breakout and pipe burst or global pandemic. The problem deepens when you are left in limbo and can’t tell for how long the adversity will last, such as the coronavirus pandemic where businesses are still wondering about the shape and extent of economic recovery, and long-term impact on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights">business models</a> and consumer behavior. After all, what do you hold onto when you make plans in uncertainty? </p><p>In such times, resilience can become a valued characteristic for businesses.</p><p>It is not possible for anyone to be fully prepared for the unknown. But resilient organizations learn to expect the unexpected. It helps them rebound more quickly than others and take first-mover advantage of many opportunities that emerge. </p><p>Resilience is not the resistance to change, but one’s ability to embrace change. And be ready for it. It is reflected in how you react to the uncertainty; how fast you bounce back; and in what health do you remain in afterward. Instead of attempting to preserve what worked in the past, resilient leaders push past their fears, brainstorm new ideas, and embrace large-scale disruption. </p><p>In nutshell, resilience is a sign of an organization’s capacity to come back stronger than ever after having been knocked down by uncertainty. </p><p>But, how do you do that? How do you ensure you that adverse situations bend you, and not break you?</p><p>Resilience starts where new perspective meets experience. It is cumulated in how you look at change. </p><p>Finding a way to rise from the ashes requires rewiring your thinking for resilience and reorganize. We suggest three steps to achieve that.</p><p><img src="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/images/survive-adapt.jpg"></p><p> First, make peace with uncertainty. Understand what has changed, what led to it, and the need to get your business back on its foot, instead of staying down and defeated. Then, change your perspective. Swap your question of why this is happening to what it is trying to teach me. Finally, make changes to your present and prepare yourself to better handle the adversity in the future. Focus on growing with new strategies in place.</p><p> Leaders must understand the value of each step for developing resilience in the organization. Those who just rebound and survive may fall into the same trap again when faced with adversity the next time.</p><h4>Ten Sage Advices to Respond to COVID-19 Uncertainty</h4><p> When facts on the ground are incomplete and in flux, what you need to put in place an operational business is experimentation. Develop a culture of responding to uncertainty by rapidly hypothesizing, testing, learning from new trials, and adapting to the models that work. Here are a few actions <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thestrategyinstitute.org/insights/at-crossroads-taking-a-platform-approach-to-business">global business leaders</a> can take in this pandemic to beat the uncertainty blues and become resilient and agile.</p><ul><li><p><b>Operate with a sense of personal safety.</b> Great leadership is always about emotional connection. In this pandemic, as a primary responsibility, ensure that everyone in your organization is safe, secure, and healthy.</p></li><li><p><b> Achieve a level of business continuity.</b> Being functional, staying afloat, and carrying on is crucial in any uncertainty. Find a way to keep going on. Use virtual medium and collaborative tools. Focus on optimizing continuity thereafter.</p></li><li><p><b> Show signs of life.</b> Make your clients and customers know you are well and available.</p></li><li><p><b>Be less promotional &amp; more comforting in your messaging.</b> You can take either a direct marketing approach or you can be more sensitive by deploying a “hope all is well” campaign and the likes. Instead of a sales pitch, most global leaders are opting to touch base by asking about customers’/clients’ wellbeing and informing them of their availability lest they need their product or services.</p></li><li><p><b>Go multichannel and focus on customer-centricity.</b> Make a zero-tolerance declaration in your organization on any internal silos against customer-centricity. Ensure that your employees imbibe that in customers are the top priority in these times. Furthermore, don’t limit yourself to one channel for communication and operations. Experiment to find one or multiple best channels that best suit your needs.</p></li><li><p><b> Stay away from the herd mentality.</b> What is working for one company may not work for you. Find your new normal as you adapt every day. Mercilessly examine your weaknesses and vulnerabilities to become stronger for the long run. Destruct archaic practices to rebuild.</p></li><li><p><b>Keep a cool head.</b> It’s not uncommon for the dropping numbers to get your nerves. Don’t panic in these situations. It’s needless. Take a step back and see what you are left with. Gratitude for what you have can open a new world of possibilities. Look toward the long-term for more motivation.</p></li><li><p><b> Organize for rapid decision-making.</b> Uncertainty catches one off-guard. If you aren’t prepared, a crisis will overwhelm you. Distribute leadership responsibilities across your organization such that your employees are self-motivated and empowered to make decisions and operate with speed. A large part of this change is to give yourself (as an organization) the permission to be wrong in case things go south.</p></li><li><p><b>Make your offerings relevant to the times.</b> Use the uncertainty to gauge where customers’ propensities lie or would change in the future. Leverage new mediums and products/services of their choice to redesign your offerings and innovate.</p></li><li><p><b>Collaboration is the key to build resilience.</b> Startups are seen as a threat by incumbents, and vice-versa. However, a variety of collaborations between startups and incumbents can help each party survive, adapt, and thrive. Right collaboration would make it easy for both to raise capital, reduce cost, and position for growth. Forge joint ventures, or project-based relationship to come up with disruptive value propositions.</p></li></ul><h4> To Sum</h4><p> What type of leadership does uncertainty demand? The answer lies in resilience and agility. Enduring hard times are about leveraging, and not reacting to the turbulence around you. Lead by preparing your teams and organization to recreate the future with you. Adopt a new perspective to carve new normal, set a new vision, and imbibe new practices.</p><p><b> Business strategists who successfully lead their organizations through uncertainty not only survive, but also shields them from future disruptions by growing their adaptability quotient.</b></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*ZuEG5yZkFwBjXBzoi6mFkQ.jpeg" alt=""></p>



<p>I’ll say it upfront for the techy people: (un)fortunately, <strong>this is NOT a MITM attack of U2F</strong>*. LastPass doesn’t support U2F so this is disappointingly simple. It uses Yubico OTP, which is phishable.</p>

<p>In this article, I demonstrate how to deploy a phishing attack on LastPass users, even when they are protected with Yubikey physical keys. I hope that this helps you appreciate that YubiKey ≠ U2F. Aside from that, I will give an overview of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what is U2F, and why it is important</li>
  <li>how LastPass encrypts and handles your vault</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*U2F stands for “Universal 2nd Factor”. This is the protocol that is likely used whenever you hear about security keys.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h4 id="use-security-keys-to-preventphishing">Use security keys to prevent&nbsp;phishing</h4>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8jei3TihbLKEG0vjuLGtew.png" alt="[Google’s transparency report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/overview?unsafe=dataset:0;series:malwareDetected,phishingDetected;start:1148194800000;end:1587279600000&amp;lu=unsafe)&nbsp;[1]">
<em><a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/overview?unsafe=dataset:0;series:malwareDetected,phishingDetected;start:1148194800000;end:1587279600000&amp;lu=unsafe">Google’s transparency report</a>&nbsp;[1]</em></p>

<p>In recent years, phishing has proven to be one of the most effective ways of hacking people. Instead of using a fancy new exploit to steal a victim’s credentials, the hacker just asks the victims to hand their credentials over.</p>

<p>Moreover, with the new remote working conditions, we are more at risk of phishing attacks. This results in headlines such as <a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/security/36691/phishing-attacks-increase-350-percent-amid-covid-19-quarantine">“Phishing Attacks Increase 350 Percent Amid COVID-19 Quarantine (2020)”</a> [2].</p>

<p>How do we combat this? Aside from educating employees on phishing attacks, security keys are an effective way to mitigate this increased risk. We see success stories such as (2018, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/">Google: Security Keys Neutralized Employee Phishing</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have had no reported or confirmed account takeovers since implementing security keys at Google”&nbsp;[3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In a phishing attack, the weak point is the human user.</strong> The user has the responsibility to distinguishing legitimate vs malicious sites. <strong>By using security keys and protocols such as U2F, you relieve some of this burden from the user.</strong> Using U2F, authentication “magically” doesn’t work when it is a malicious site, even when the victim is tricked.</p>

<p>Below we see LastPass endorsing the use of YubiKeys. In the diagram, we see that YubiKey is more secure, easy to use, and not phishable.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*JBB9n3hJZxZoTYBqD_IP0w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With that said, I recently got myself some Yubikeys. To use this “Advanced Multi-factor Option” with Lastpass, I needed a premium account. Being a long time user of Lastpass, I didn’t think twice and paid to upgrade to premium.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Within minutes, I felt shortchanged. It quickly became obvious that using a Yubikey did not make my LastPass vault any more secure against phishing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why? Lastpass’s integration with Yubico using <strong><em>Yubico OTP and not U2F.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>Here’s a list of levels of auth from the <em>“the Hierarchy of Auth”</em> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/beyond-passwords-2fa-u2f-and-google-advanced-protection/">[18]</a> from least secure to most secure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Password alone</li>
  <li>Password and SMS</li>
  <li>Password and soft token (LastPass + Google Authenticator)</li>
  <li>Password and hard token (LastPass + Yubico OTP)</li>
  <li><strong>Password and U2F (Security Keys)</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>(3) and (4) give similar protections against phishing. (5) mitigates phishing best. So although we are using a Yubikey, we aren’t using it as a security key*.</p>

<p><em>Is this important and is U2F really THAT more secure?</em></p>

<p>Let me show you why this is important.</p>

<p><em>*Let’s reserve the term “security key” only when using U2F. So a YubiKey 5 can be used both in an OTP mode and security key mode.</em></p>

<h3 id="how-to-deploy-phishingcampaign">How to deploy phishing&nbsp;campaign</h3>

<p>Let’s take a red team mindset to appreciate why phishing is so effective and how easy it is for us to fall for it. We use a reverse proxy to do a “man-in-the-middle” (MITM) attack to steal the credentials and bypass 2 Factor Authentication (2FA).</p>

<p>Here’s an overview of how a MITM attack works.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tBGvXDJ86Vgkm0QPKU_KDA.png" alt="We’re nice people. We will log-in LastPass for you">
<em>We’re nice people. We will log-in LastPass for you&nbsp;😊</em></p>

<p>Of course, phishing using MITM applies to many other sites. What makes LastPass unique is that it is the only site that I personally use that is still vulnerable to MITM even when using a Yubikey.</p>

<h4 id="information-gathering">Information Gathering</h4>

<p>Let’s say you have to target an individual or a company. You first try to get a small collection of email addresses from searching through LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, blogs, and other <a href="https://osintframework.com/">OSINT sources.</a></p>

<p>Now with these target emails, you explore the options available for your attack. The LastPass vault is a gold mine of credentials since one phishing attack can result in many credentials. Let’s see if these emails are possible LastPass users.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*oSRXFfUNTYvcO7-9wbnyuA.png" alt="google@gmail.com uses Lastpass?">
<em>google@gmail.com uses Lastpass?</em></p>

<p>Since the registration processes would check the availability of an email address, we can use it to gather more intel. If the email address is taken, then it is likely that the owner uses LastPass.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*QwVGvFSvUVQlAYkvGcjKhw.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you want to enumerate a small list of potential targets, then you can use this simple API which returns ok/no.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>GET https://lastpass.com/create_account.php?check=avail&amp;skipcontent=1&amp;mistype=1&amp;username=google%40gmail.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For targeted attacks, this is an effective way to check whether or not you can be phished on LastPass. Broader random attacks would be unlikely if the availability endpoint is rate limited.</p>

<h4 id="getting-the-rightdomain">Getting the right&nbsp;domain</h4>

<p>Having a legitimate-looking domain might make it easier to trick the victim. There are a lot of ways that we can gain a legitimate-looking domain. Maybe slight modifications of the spelling or explore other TLDs. We chose <code>lastpass.com.es</code></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_JWMEckSw6ijACvtwABIKA.png" alt="As of 2020/05/25">
<em>As of 2020/05/25</em></p>

<p>Here are other examples of possible phishing domains for LastPass.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BgDfnRnQ8PF6UY3W-gdkiA.png" alt="As of 2020/05/25">
<em>As of 2020/05/25</em></p>

<p>These are domains that are affordable for a red team and individual hackers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you realize that in cases such as this one, a domain like <code>lastpass.com.es</code> is as suspicious as <code>lastpaazz.com</code> and <code>lastpass.club</code>.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-theservers">Setting up the&nbsp;servers</h4>

<p>To set up our phishing site I’ve prepared a <a href="https://github.com/pberba/evilginx2">fork of evilginx2</a>, which has some additional logic to steal the credentials from LastPass.</p>

<p>This is a golang application, so you would need to install golang and run the following commands:</p>



<p>It is surprising how mature the phishing tools are. The development of this only took around just a day. It is easy to set up phishing sites for your bank, or company website, complete with domain and SSL.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*E0EMVroZkVYm9dbRNTSIgQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can set this up on your favorite cloud hosting provider. After setting up the binaries of <em>evilginx2.</em> You run it and then configure the LastPass phishlet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo</span> ./bin/evilginx <span>-p</span> ./phishlets/ <span>-developer</span>

<span>&gt;</span> config ip 127.0.0.1  
<span>&gt;</span> config domain lastpass.com.es

<span>&gt;</span> phishlets <span>hostname </span>lastpass lastpass.com.es  
<span>&gt;</span> phishlets <span>enable </span>lastpass
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then you create the link you want to bait them. The <code>redirect_url</code> is the page you want the victim to end up once you get all the necessary credentials.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> lures create lastpass  
<span>&gt;</span> lures edit redirect_url 0 <span>[</span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v<span>=</span>dQw4w9WgXcQ]<span>(</span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v<span>=</span>dQw4w9WgXcQ<span>)</span>  
<span>&gt;</span> lures get-url 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8m8tlF4QxxiU87_jYXdPpQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In our case, we want our victim to go <code>https://lastpass[.]com[.]es/QBFlGqJy</code></p>

<p>Note: For this to work locally you might need to add the following to <code>/etc/hosts</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code>127.0.0.1 lastpass.com.es  
127.0.0.1 lp-cdn.lastpass.com.es  
127.0.0.1 www.lastpass.com.es
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="sending-the-phishingemail">Sending the Phishing&nbsp;Email</h4>

<p>Assuming that you use an existing phishlet, then we have to make a phishing email. This is really where a lot of the work comes in. You have to somehow trick the user into clicking the link. Crafting a good phishing email is an art.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ssc1naUhYfA6kPC6G_QonA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this case, we say that we have revoked trusted devices so that hopefully, he won’t be surprised just in case he gets alerts of new log-ins.</p>

<h4 id="waiting-for-the-credentials">Waiting for the credentials</h4>

<p>When the victim clicks on the link, he will be redirected to the fake LastPass login.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Sn7hQ739Z9T4wthlcBymUg.png" alt="Notice lastpass.com.es">
<em>Notice lastpass.com.es</em></p>

<p>And when LastPass requires 2FA, then the fake website will ask the victim to provide the second factor.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oEpo4ztAWvEFgoCbZOgEJg.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As <a href="https://versprite.com/blog/application-security/reverse-proxy-attack/">previous work</a> [4] has mentioned, the victim will likely have to verify with their email because the logon activity is new. However, this might look less suspicious if we have already primed the victims to expect this by saying we’ve “revoked trusted devices”.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AFrkmKHksC6IO4B78C4evg.png" alt="Screenshot from [Versprite’s article](https://versprite.com/blog/application-security/reverse-proxy-attack/)&nbsp;[4]">
<em>Screenshot from <a href="https://versprite.com/blog/application-security/reverse-proxy-attack/">Versprite’s article</a>&nbsp;[4]</em></p>

<p>Once the session is trusted, the victim’s browser will start to download the encrypted vault. We steal this using the proxy along with the username and password of the victim.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jAXEAYqDL4WU1lPbzCwf3Q.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Afterward, the victim will be redirected a some chosen site. In this case, the victim will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">redirected to your chosen page.</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have all that we need to get all the victim’s credentials.</p>

<h4 id="decrypting-thevault">Decrypting the&nbsp;vault</h4>

<p>To decrypt the LastPass Vault, you would need 3 main ingredients:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LastPass Username</li>
  <li>LastPass Password</li>
  <li>Encrypted Vault</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WcIJmdRs2_ZxtPbe9RZKIA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>With a MITM, we can steal the victim’s username and password, and once the session is trusted after OTP from the YubiKey, we can download the encrypted vault.</p>

<p>The original intention of the evilginx2 is to hijack the session. But I’ve found that it is easier to just dump the credentials in the vault. In theory, the proxy can get all necessary information to take takeover of the account.</p>

<p>In the project, I’ve provided a script <code>scripts/lastpass-python/dump_lastpass.py</code> This parses the evilginx2 DB and decrypts the credentials. The location of the DB depends on where the config file is. In my case it was <code>/var/root/.evilginx/data.db</code></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*wja3kBicR48eBBy2c1vKcQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This creates two files, one for credentials of the LastPass accounts, and the other is the credentials found in the vaults. You have everything in the vault, name, folder, username, password, URL, and secure notes associated with the item.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*U-ZDsURt9ZhgYTMKTYICMQ.png" alt="creds-dump.csv">
<em>creds-dump.csv</em></p>

<p>You can easily leverage this to try to take control of as much of the accounts that you can. To maximize your impact, you can write a script to automatically check if there are recovery codes in the notes. With the passwords and the recovery codes, you will have full control of their accounts.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ftmKGyeE8GaoxoVJEXnH5g.png" alt="Should we put all our eggs in one&nbsp;basket?">
<em>Should we put all our eggs in one&nbsp;basket?</em></p>

<h4 id="quick-notes-onphishing">Quick Notes on&nbsp;Phishing</h4>

<p>Again, this problem is not specific to LastPass. You can be phished on almost any site you use. Some of them would have fewer protections than LastPass. However, among the main password managers, I think LastPass is the only one who still doesn’t support U2F.</p>

<p>How do we detect a phishing email?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is trivial for an attacker to copy the design of an email. In our example, you might be able to detect it using the source domain. …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>According to <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">WebAims annual accessibility analysis</a>, 98.1% of home pages of the top 1,000,000 websites have detectable WCAG 2.0 failures. Some of these sites may only have minor contrast issues or maybe just a single missing <code>id</code>, while others are highly inaccessible. However, this number is pretty damn high, considering the fact that automatic testing tools <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/">only report obvious accessibility issues</a>.</p><div><p>Only 1.9% of the tested home pages pass automatic testing, which is fine, but it doesn’t mean that <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/">there aren’t any barriers on these websites</a> either. True accessibility extends beyond automated tests and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> regulations.</p><p>It's fair to say that most websites are <strong>only accessible to some</strong>.</p><p>98.1% sounds bad, but for most of us it’s just a number, isn’t it? For me, as someone whose job it is to help others build accessible websites, it’s easier to imagine what the real-life effects of these failures can be. To help you get a better understanding of what this high percentage means for users and their daily experiences on the web, I created a little experiment.</p><p>My partner is an architect, and she sparked my interest in modern architecture. That’s why I built a web page about an architectural movement in Europe, and for my experiment I would like you to open the page and read it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Recently there was a security breach on Shopify, where two rogue employees stole customer data - names, emails, addresses as well as order details like products and services purchased.</p><p>Security breaches happen, to even the most popular websites - but what is important is the way companies react to these security breaches. Kylie Cosmetics handled this really well by doing the following:</p><p><strong>1. Being proactive.</strong></p><p>The security breach from Shopify affected 200 stores, and Kylie Cosmetics was the first store to publicly talk about the breach. Kylie Cosmetics emailed all their customers, and also uploaded information regarding the breach on their website. </p><p>Most people initially became aware of this security breach via Kylie Cosmetics. If you go through Shopify’s community forums you can see that customers initially became aware of this incident via emails from Kylie Cosmetics. It’s impressive that Kylie Cosmetics was the first store to publicize the incident. </p><p><strong>2. Taking ownership</strong></p><p>It is important to highlight that Shopify has not released the names of all the 200 stores that got compromised in this security breach. So, if Kylie Cosmetics didn’t talk about this incident (via emails and on their company website), there probably is no way that we would have ever known that Kylie Cosmetics is also one among this 200 stores that got compromised in this beach.</p><p>They could have easily stayed quiet and no one would have known that Kylie Cosmetics customer data was also compromised in this beach. Only a handful of stores have come out and publicly said that their customers details have also been leaked via this breach. We still have no idea which all stores got affected by this. So, props to Kylie Cosmetics for releasing this information to their customers.</p><p><strong>3. Being transparent and honest</strong></p><p>This security breach resulted from the actions of two Shopify’s employees - and not because of Shopify code or some other tech mishaps. Therefore, the impact of this breach is less. </p><p>Shopify has also stated that credit card details have not been compromised, and there is no evidence that the stolen information - names, emails, addresses and order details - have been used in any way. </p><p>There is a good chance that most of Kylie Cosmetics customers would not have even heard about this incident if not for emails from Kylie Cosmetics. So, considering that the impact of this security breach is very minimal - it is even more impressive that Kylie Cosmetics was transparent and honest about this from the beginning.</p><p><strong>4. Being the source and controlling the narrative</strong></p><p>All of Kylie Cosmetics customers first heard about this via emails from Kylie Cosmetics. Kylie Cosmetics controlled the narrative. They took responsibility and became the source of information regarding this security breach for their customers. It would have been really bad if their customers came to know of the breach from other media websites or from Shopify itself. </p><p>By being the source, they could also highlight what they are doing to recover from this incident. Kylie Cosmetics was also able to communicate that this incident is being looked into (Shopify has fired the two employees, launched an investigation, and also notified the FBI regarding this incident.), and that it is still safe to shop from the Kylie Cosmetics store.</p><p>Considering that this incident only affected 200 stores, and that Shopify has not released the names of the breached stores, I am impressed with the transparency shown by Kylie Cosmetics. Big props to Kylie Cosmetics for the way they handled the incident.</p><p>‍</p><p>Shopify has talked about the incident here: <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/td-p/888971">https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/td-p/888971</a></p><p>More information from Kylie Cosmetics regarding this here:<a href="https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/pages/faqs"> https://www.kyliecosmetics.com/pages/faqs</a><br></p></div></div></div>]]>

  <p><span>03 Oct 2020</span></p><p>Disney Animation’s Moana island dataset is a production-scale scene with memory requirements that make it challenging to render. This post summarizes some of those challenges, and describes how the <a href="https://github.com/chellmuth/gpu-motunui">GPU-Motunui</a> project is able to efficiently render the scene on a consumer-grade GPU with less than 8GB of memory. <a href="#renders">Click here</a> to skip ahead to the results.</p>

<h2 id="the-moana-island">The Moana island</h2>

<p>In 2018, Disney Animation released the Moana island dataset to the rendering research community. Compared to traditional research scenes, the scale of the Moana island scene is massive: the scene contains 90 million quad primitives, 5 million curves, and more than 28 million instances. All told, the island consists of over 15 billion primitives, weighing in at just under 30GB of geometry files.</p>

<p>The shots included with the dataset are beautiful, and showcase the amazing imagery that can be created by combining the best artists in the world with path tracing techniques and modern hardware. Here are two reference images, rendered with Disney’s proprietary Hyperion renderer:</p>

</div>

<h2 id="gpu-motunui-project">GPU-Motunui Project</h2>

<p>The goal of the GPU-Motunui project is to render all the Moana shots efficiently and accurately on a consumer-grade graphics card. There are two main challenges to accomplishing this with the Moana dataset. First, with a typical graphics card having only 8GB of memory, an out-of-core rendering solution is required to handle the large amounts of geometry. Second, the scene’s textures are provided in the Ptex format, and Ptex doesn’t have a publicly available CUDA implementation. This project currently only solves the first problem, and Ptex texture lookup is done on the CPU (although conveniently its cost is fully hidden by being computed concurrently with GPU shadow ray tracing).</p>

<p>The Hyperion reference images are impossible to match exactly; for example the varying brown and green colors along the palm tree fronds in the palmsCam shot are not provided in the dataset. Other features of the scene are possible to render but out of my initial scope, notably subdivision surfaces and their displacement maps, and a full Disney BSDF implementation.</p>

</div>

<p>All ray tracing operations are run through Nvidia’s OptiX 7 API. This means GPU-Motunui gets the full benefits of available RT cores and a world-class BVH implementation. The following sections describe how GPU-Motunui maps dataset assets to OptiX data structures, and how GPU-Motunui’s out-of-core rendering solution works.</p>

<h3 id="scene-representation">Scene representation</h3>

<p>The Moana scene makes widespread use of multi-level instancing. In OptiX, this requires a three-level hierarchy of acceleration structures to manage: two levels of IASs, and a base level of GASs (Instance Acceleration Structures and Geometry Acceleration Structures, respectively). GPU-Motunui makes use of OptiX’s AS compaction and relocation APIs to further reduce memory usage.</p>

<p>The isHibiscus element makes a good example of how a typical element in the scene is organized and built. The tree is assembled from a base model in one Wavefront .obj file (containing the trunk and branches), and four primitives: one flower and three leaf models (each with their own .obj file).</p>

<div>

<p>Left: The four simple primitives that will be instanced to fill out the hibiscus tree <br>Right: The base trunk and branches model </p>
</div>

<p>In OptiX, each of these models has an associated GAS, and each GAS can be subdivided into multiple build inputs. Build inputs are used to map sections of the model to information needed at shading time by indexing into OptiX’s shader binding table. These GASs form the bottom level of the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Next, an IAS is used to build the full isHibiscus element. This IAS is in the middle level of the hierarchy. The figure below shows each primitive’s instances in isolation, and combined to make the full element:</p>

<div>

<p>Left: Isolated instances for each primitive<br>Right: Full isHibiscus element</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, a second IAS is built to track all of the element’s instances present in the scene. This second IAS is the top level of the instance hierarchy.</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://www.render-blog.com/assets/isHibiscus-instanced-elements.png" alt="The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances"></p><p>The shotCam view rendered with only isHibiscus instances</p>
</div>

<p>Although the isHibiscus element has a typical structure, there are some more complicated elements included in the dataset. The isCoral element, for example, has different base geometry and instanced primitives for each of its element instances, but the underlying primitive geometries are shared across all the element instances.</p>

<p>The Moana GAS and IASs alone require 18.5 GB, well past the memory budget of my 8GB RTX 2070. Because OptiX has no native support for out-of-core rendering, the traditional OptiX pipeline had to be put aside for a custom-made solution.</p>

<h3 id="out-of-core-rendering">Out-of-core rendering</h3>

<p>To solve the out-of-core rendering problem, GPU-Motunui divides the scene’s geometry into different sections, and ray traces each separately, while tracking the closest hit. Replacing a traditional device trace call with a host loop comes with many design consequences to the renderer, from asset loading to the core path tracing loop that sends rays through the scene.</p>

<p>Before rendering, the asset loading process allocates a large chunk of GPU memory (currently 6.7GB). A custom allocator is implemented that manages this block of memory. It is responsible for allocating two types of memory: output and temporary. Output memory is allocated from the left of the block, and is used for OptiX structures. Temporary memory is managed on a stack from the right end of the memory block. Managing the temporary memory this way ensures that the output structures are always tightly packed.</p>

<p>After elements are processed into their accelerator structures on the GPU, their used memory is snapshotted onto the host, and the allocator is cleared. The process is repeated until all of the scene’s geometry is processed, resulting in the host managing a list of GPU memory snapshots. The figure below shows an example layout of GPU memory that could be snapshotted:</p>

<div>
  <p>GPU memory layout after loading the isHibiscus element.<br>(Dotted arrows show that an IAS holds instances of the pointed-at AS)</p>

</div>

<p>As mentioned above, when it comes time to ray trace, each snapshot is processed in a loop. This means a call to <code>cudaMemcpy</code> and <code>optixLaunch</code> for each snapshot. A global buffer is maintained that indicates the depth of the current closest intersection. This value is used as the <code>tmax</code> parameter for the CUDA kernel’s call to <code>optixTrace</code>, and a successful intersection will update the depth buffer for the next launch.</p>

<p>In a traditional OptiX path tracer, the entire render loop can run in device code inside a single call to <code>optixLaunch</code>; i.e., a successful intersection will lead to more BSDF and shadow rays being traced in the same kernel launch. Because GPU-Motunui’s design mandates multiple launches for tracing each path segment, the render loop is pulled out into host code. While this potentially diminishes OptiX’s ability to efficiently schedule program execution, it also opens up opportunties for optimization, such as running Ptex texture lookups on the CPU concurrently with GPU kernels and I/O.</p>

<h3 id="shading">Shading</h3>
<p>As with any OptiX application, GPU-Motunui makes use of the shader binding table (SBT). SBT records contain pointers to normal buffers and material attributes. The underlying data for the normal buffers is stored alongside OptiX acceleration structures and included in geometry snapshots. This ensures that GPU memory is never wasted on unreachable normal buffer data.</p>

<h2 id="renders">Renders</h2>
<p>Included below are GPU-Motunui renders of the six scenes included in the dataset. shotCam is the slowest to render at 18.2 seconds per sample at 1024x429 resolution, and took just over five hours total for the final image. All shots are 1024spp, capped at a maximum of five bounces, and were run on an Nvidia RTX 2070.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>The initial implementation of the renderer required 42.6 seconds per 1spp on the shotCam scene. A few optimizations combined to make significant reductions in rendering time, cutting each pass down to 18.2 seconds (a 57.3% reduction).</p>

<h4 id="cpugpu-concurrency">CPU/GPU concurrency</h4>
<p>Tracing shadow rays on the GPU in parallel with Ptex lookups on the CPU cut rendering time by 23.4%. It was disappointing to be forced to do texture lookups on the CPU, but the time savings make up for it.</p>

<h4 id="multiple-ptex-caches">Multiple Ptex caches</h4>
<p>Parallelizing the Ptex lookups and using multiple Ptex caches eliminated texture lookups as a bottleneck to the system; shadow ray casting time fully dominates the texture lookup. Empirically, spawning two threads per core (totaling 12 on an Intel i7-8700K) and sharing three Ptex caches comfortably reduced the texture lookup time beneath the shadow ray budget. This improved the time savings to a 33.9% reduction over the baseline.</p>

<h4 id="pinned-memory">Pinned memory</h4>
<p>The acceleration structure snapshots are all saved to pinned host memory. Switching from normal to pinned host memory increased the transfer throughput from 7.73 GB/s to 11.84 GB/s, cutting the baseline render time by 19.5%.</p>

<h2 id="future-steps">Future Steps</h2>
<p>Getting this scene running on my RTX 2070 card was a very fun and rewarding project, but there are still many improvements to be made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implementing the Disney BSDF</li>
  <li>Rendering subdivision surfaces along with displacement mapping</li>
  <li>More efficiently packing the acceleration structures, and optimizing ray tracing throughput</li>
  <li>Experimenting with how various research results hold up on production scenes (e.g., testing select path guiding techniques)</li>
</ul>

                    <p><strong>Do you truly control your content if you post it on Medium?</strong></p><figure><img src="https://www.nedmcclain.com/content/images/2020/02/image-4.png"></figure><p>At the beginning of this year, I switched from Medium to a static site powered by Ghost. Although <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> is a strong choice if you have paying subscribers, it is impossible to beat static hosting for a simple blog. Static sites are fast, secure, and free.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of my reasoning and approach - from editing in Ghost's world-class UI to deploying for free on a static hosting provider like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>I was looking for a blogging solution that met these requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Slick UI:</strong> Even though I use vim and markdown daily, I prefer a Medium-like freeform writing experience.</li><li><strong>Self-hosted: </strong>Full control of my content with no vendor lock-in, paywalls, or subscription pop-ups.</li><li><strong>High availability:</strong> I should never receive a monitoring alert for my personal blog.</li><li><strong>Exceptional performance:</strong> I want the page to load fast!</li><li><strong>Secure and low-maintenance:</strong> After supporting dozens of WordPress sites over more than a decade, I have grown weary of hacked plugins and frequent patching cycles.</li></ul><h2 id="static-ghost-io-">Static Ghost.io 👻</h2><p>Even though I use markdown every day in my work, I prefer the WYSIWYG writing experience of a web UI. Ghost's UI is fantastic!</p><figure><img src="https://www.nedmcclain.com/content/images/2020/10/nm_ghost.png"></figure><p>The main drawback of Ghost is the same as WordPress: every request depends on a database. Each time a user visits a page on the site, the following steps take place:</p><ol><li>The web server passes the end user's request to a running application server (Node.js for Ghost, PHP for WordPress).</li><li>The application server analyzes the incoming request and dispatches requests to the database for necessary content (MySQL for Ghost).</li><li>The application server renders the content from the database into a web page.</li><li>The web server passes the resulting page back to the end user.</li></ol><p>This architecture requires significant compute and memory resources on both the application server and database server. &nbsp;It is susceptible to performance issues due to spikes in demand. And achieving high availability requires a database cluster and web load balancer. Lots of distinct parts to deploy, secure, and operate.</p><p>The advent of the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a> architecture has brought static sites into the limelight. By moving steps 2 and 3 <strong>to the beginning</strong>, Ghost can generate each page on the site <strong>in advance</strong>. Then, it's easy to upload the static site to a free or almost-free hosting provider (see below for suggestions).</p><blockquote>Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers. - JAMstack</blockquote><p>Static sites have a significantly smaller attack surface than sites driven by databases and application code. Bugs, vulnerabilities, and build issues can be identified by the build phase, rather than when the site is live. </p><p>You get the rich editing of Ghost while enjoying all of the operational and cost advantages of a static JAM site:</p><ul><li>Never worry about scaling when traffic spikes.</li><li>Never apply a critical security patch at midnight.</li><li>Who cares if your Ghost database is temporarily down?</li></ul><h2 id="making-ghost-static">Making Ghost Static</h2><p>First, setup a <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/setup/">private Ghost instance</a> to use for editing, formatting, and peer review. This can be a very small VM, since it doesn't have to serve any production traffic. Defying traditional best-practices, it's even safe to co-locate MySQL on the same system! <a href="https://valet.ghost.org/">Ghost(Valet)</a> is very reasonably priced if you need a hand with this step.</p><p>You can secure access to this system with a firewall or VPN. A better approach is to use an authentication proxy like <a href="https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy">oauth2-proxy</a> or <a href="https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium">pomerium</a> for a user-friendly, "zero trust" solution.</p><p>Then, use Ghost Static Site Generator (<code>gssg</code>) &nbsp;to create a static mirror of the site that is hosted by Netlify:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator"><div><p>Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p>Generate a static site from ghost and deploy using a CI - Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19606031?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p><code>gssg</code> will spider your local Ghost site, creating a fully static copy. Here's the short Makefile I use:</p><pre><code>all:
	rm -rf static/
	gssg --url https://www.nedmcclain.com --domain http://127.0.0.1:2368
	cp ghost/etc/keybase.txt static/
	cp static/404/index.html static/404.html</code></pre><p>You can publish this copy to your Netlify site with their CLI or by (recommended) linking a Git repository. Netlify <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">offers</a> 100GB of bandwidth/month for free, which is plenty for most use cases. They also take care of TLS certificates automatically.</p><figure><a href="https://www.netlify.com/"><div><p>Netlify: All-in-one platform for automating modern web projects</p><p>Deploy modern static websites with Netlify.

Say goodbye to Ghost's <a href="https://ghost.org/integrations/">library of integrations</a>, and you won't be able to monetize with Ghost's <a href="https://ghost.org/members/">membership and subscription management</a>.</p><p>It's easy to include contact/feedback forms with tools like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/forms/">Netlify Forms</a> or <a href="https://upscribe.io/">Upscribe</a>. You can embed rich media, social media, and all kinds of Javascript widgets (weather, news, etc.). But if you intend to have users login to your site, you'll need a database-backed service.</p><p>For paid creators, Substack is growing in popularity with its focus on newsletters. Truly complex sites with many editors should evaluate Drupal or consider custom development. But I would encourage you to check out <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> - your subscription goes back into the Ghost foundation, making the software even better.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>In the last 10 weeks Ghost has made over $140,000 for independent publishers, creators and newsletters — all while our new membership functionality is still in beta!</p><p>Growth for the last 6 months or so has been pretty nuts, and we've got some big releases coming up :)</p></div>— John O'Nolan 🏴‍☠️ (@JohnONolan) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnONolan/status/1311957056698499072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="it-works-">It Works!</h2><p>This site is created with Ghost and hosted by the fine folks at Netlify.

        </header>
      

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>So first off a personal update – last year, I got laid off the day I returned from maternity leave! Within a half hour of returning to my desk! Whew boy! It was a blessing in disguise in some ways, because 1) I’d been thinking for some time I could be more effective in a consulting role and 2) as part of my severance package, I got to attend a General Assembly coding bootcamp.</p>

<p>I ended up auditing the bootcamp because wow, it demands a ton of sacrifice with the end goal of getting a developer job. In contrast, I am happy to do a bit of scripting on the side, work with developers, and improve their experiences. Nonetheless, I worked through all the lectures, did a few homework assignments, and got a lot out of it. Not the least of which is that I validated my existing coding skills, gained deeper insight into the “junior developer” persona, and reaffirmed my conviction that tailoring your developer experience and docs to junior developers is a <strong>Good Thing</strong>.</p>

<p>There are a couple of big takeaways I’d like to share:</p>

<h3 id="everyone-is-a-junior-developer">Everyone is a junior developer</h3>

<p>Well, no, not actually … but every developer has to learn new concepts.  And yes, of course, as you gain experience as a developer, “totally new” concepts get rarer and rarer. Still, there’s a lot of learning:</p>

<p>Some developers must learn a breakneck pace (think of all the Javascript frameworks coming out all the time! Those front-end folks have to sprint just to stay in place). Others face big disruptions to their coding world only occasionally (your Enterprise Java programmer with a 20 year career in monolithic app development who now lives in a brave new world of microservices, CI/CD, devops, oh my!)</p>

<p>I felt I experienced this disruption myself as part of the coding bootcamp. Up till then, my background was in writing Python scripts, and in documenting big Java applications in a analytics microservices context. I knew about RedHat, Docker, Kubernetes, Spark, Lucene, Cassandra, etc.</p>

<p>Now, I was learning about a whole new world: the ecosystems, the mindset, the business of ….  JavaScript.  Like probably many people outside the JavaScript world, I was fooled by the “script” part of the name – especially since I’d only used JavaScript myself to write macros in an XML docs tool.  Now I realize it’s <a href="https://www.javaworld.com/article/2886368/java-vs-nodejs-an-epic-battle-for-developer-mindshare.html">epic battle</a> between Java and JavaScript. And while I haven’t fallen in love (Python, you still have my heart), I had lots of “oh, that’s neat!” moments. I also recognized that my learning curve was not dissimilar to that of experienced – but JavaScript-naïve – developers.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my main point:</p>

<h3 id="we-should-all-design-for-the-junior-developer">We should all design for the junior developer</h3>

<p>Creating experiences with a junior developer in mind forces you to discard your comfy assumption that everyone’s drunk your product Kool-aid. If you assume you’re writing for someone who’s technically savvy and can learn quickly, but who knows nothing about your world, you’re positioning yourself to vastly decrease your developer onboarding friction. And if you assume that your “junior developer” is super impatient because they have, like, 10 other things on the docket to learn about, then you’ll learn to answer up front the question: “why should I care? Why should I do this work?”</p>

<p>It’s a fine line to tread, assuming not too much about technical knowledge, but also not coming across as condescending or silly (like, at the level of “open a terminal by taking the following steps…”). Still, I think it’s actually quite achievable. For example, it’s quite low effort to provide high-level context for coding instructions. Even something as simple as “Clone this repository and open a terminal at the local directory location” is a direction that often gets left out in GitHub readmes…but it really shouldn’t be left out.  And it never hurts to link to frameworks’ getting started guides, even if you don’t want to provide the details yourself. At the very least, no one is likely to roll their eyes at it, and it helps your reader understand what level of granularity your instructions will provide.</p>

<p>When I look for inspiration, I think the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React newbie tutorials</a> do an outstanding job of introducing junior developers to React, helping them understand why they should care, and explicitly stating their audience. I also really love (who doesn’t) the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/register">Stripe developer onboarding</a> experience.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think I came away from the coding bootcamp more confident that I <em>am</em> a junior developer. And while I’d never make the classic UX mistake of thinking I am the user, still – my confusions, my pain points in learning about a product– these are things that other developers likely share.</p>

<h3 id="postscript-fun-with-javascript">Postscript: Fun with Javascript!</h3>

<p>I’ll end on another personal note. The coding bootcamp turned out to be quite serendipitous, because I took on contracting work that immediately benefited from my new knowledge. I’d just learned about Express, and now here I was, entering a pull request to change the authentication method for an Express server. I’d just learned about React, and now here I was, wading into a web UI to change some text. It’s always nice when you can put what you’ve learned to immediate use.</p>

</ul>

<p>The <i>VFX Forth for Linux</i> family consists of a 64 bit version for x86_64 and 32-bit x86 and 32-bit ARM versions built from the same code tree as the Windows and Mac OS/X versions; please refer to the <a href="https://www.mpeforth.com/software/pc-systems/vfx-forth-common-features/">Common features</a> page for a more detailed description of aspects common to all versions, e.g. code generation. VFX Forth for Linux also works on FreeBSD with the Linux compatibility layer installed.</p>
<p>The current release is v5.1. This release includes code generation changes, an improved shared library interface, the GTK+ cross-platform GUI code, a port of Bernd Paysan’s Minos and Theseus GUI designer, and Hanno Schwalm’s fJACK audio interface.</p>
<p>Read the latest <a href="http://soton.mpeforth.com/downloads/VfxCommunity/Release.VFX64.txt" target="_blank">64 bit release notes</a> or <a href="http://soton.mpeforth.com/downloads/VfxCommunity/Release.VFX.txt" target="_blank">32 bit release notes</a>. Release notes for all earlier versions of VFX Forth can be found <a href="https://www.mpeforth.com/arena/relhist.vfx.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>The ARM version works on all 32 bit distributions that support the EABI – that’s most everything these days, including the Raspberry Pi and the Beaglebone Black.</p>
<p>A customer said:<br>
<em>“Besides the amazing optimizing compiler, I love the DocGen documentation system. The easy C interfacing and Genio driver architecture have also been key for my project. And finally, I can even generate turnkey apps customized for my eBox 2300SX.” </em></p>


<h2>GTK+ Cross Platform GUI</h2>
<hr>
<p>We have settled on GTK+ as a suitable cross-platform GUI library. Now that we have VFX Forth for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, it was time to take the original Linux interface more seriously. Now the GTK+ interface is cross platform, so it’s one of the <a href="https://www.mpeforth.com/software/pc-systems/vfx-forth-common-features/">common</a> features.The four pictures are from Windows, Mac OS X, x86 Linux and ARM Linux. All four were produced by compiling the same source code with no changes. The library interface file contains a small amount of conditional compilation for library file names, but that’s all that changes between operating systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mpeforth.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CrossPlat.jpg" alt="GTK + Cross Platform GUI" width="600" height="175"></p>



<h2>Minos and Theseus</h2>
<hr>
<p>Minos is an OOP-based GUI display system and widget library written by Bernd Paysan, ported to VFX Forth and released under an LGPL license. It is dependent only on the presence of the X-Windows libraries and the OpenGL libraries for graphics displays. As a consequence, it uses little RAM and can be used on low-powered systems.</p>
<p>Theseus is the GUI designer component, also by Bernd Paysan and released under LGPL. The screenshot below shows it in use constructing a prototype GUI front-end for VFX Forth.</p>
<p>LGPL exemptions and technical support contracts for Minos and Theseus are available separately. Minos and Theseus are supplied with all editions of VFX Forth for Linux.</p>
<center><img src="https://www.mpeforth.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/menuexample1.png" alt="Theseus screenshot" width="769" height="599">&nbsp;<em>Theseus</em><a name="examples"></a></center><center></center>&nbsp;


<h2>Examples and Libraries</h2>
<hr>
<p>VFX Forth comes with a wide range of application examples.</p>
<p>Libraries include multitasking, floating point, serial and socket-based communications, benchmarks, BNF parsers, binary overlays, full file system support, and more than a dozen application-oriented examples to get you off to a flying start.</p>
<p>VFX Forth for ARM Linux includes a direct GPIO access example for the Raspberry Pi with a bit toggle rate of about 10 MHz using the generic GPIO functions, and somewhat faster using functions dedicated to the peripheral pin. Root privilege is required. This example can easily be modified for other ARM Linux platforms. It is particularly useful for writing simple peripheral drivers in user space, e.g. I2C master – no kernel driver required.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><b>x86_64/AMD64:</b> Any 64 bit Linux with 64 bit libraries; all 64 bit distros that we know about</li>
<li><b>x86:</b> Any version of x86 Linux with 32-bit libraries, e.g. any Red Hat or Debian distribution or derivative. An x87 compatible maths co-processor is required for floating-point maths.</li>
<li><b>ARM</b> Any version of ARM Linux with EABI support and 32-bit libraries, e.g. any Red Hat or Debian distribution or derivative. A VFP floating point unit is required for floating-point maths.<a name="mpecomp"></a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatible with other MPE Products</h2>
<hr>
<p>The VFX Forth kernel is source-code compatible with MPE’s Forth cross compilers, and compatibility for other versions of VFX Forth for Windows or Mac OS X has been made simple.</p>

<h2>Ordering</h2>

I've led dozens of meetings in the past.  Typically I need to invest prep time and create a fancy PowerPoint presentation or a document outlining the steps for a new process.  I deliver my presentation, wrapping up with a summary of the most important points.  Ultimately I ask if there are any questions with maybe one or two questions popping up, but usually, there aren't any.</p><p id="viewer-7k88h">But the fact that there are typically very few questions gives me an uneasy feeling and reduces my confidence that the topic of the meeting was grasped by the attendants.  I know that I will need to follow-up with them or put in place measurements to ensure the message was received. </p><p id="viewer-378ak">Since my messaging isn't reaching my team effectively,  I started to ask myself how I can improve.  What can I do to make my messaging clearer?  Is my messaging too complicated? What can I do to get my team more engaged?  How can I get acknowledgment that the message was understood?</p><p id="viewer-43fli">Going through this process made me realize that the more engaged I was, the more questions I asked.  The more I wanted to learn about what the real issue was, the more questions I asked.  Maybe if I provide an environment that encouraged questions, or asking more questions, the more confident I would feel that my message was received.  </p><h3 id="viewer-em0if"><strong>Receiving more questions</strong></h3><p id="viewer-81r8h">Many management teams from older or traditional companies aren't open to receiving questions.  The inquiries might be perceived as a challenge to their authority or even worse a challenge to their expertise.  Leaders might feel they are expected to be all-knowing but questions can help leaders know what they don't know.    I don't expect the CEO of a large company to know everything about every single job function.  How could she?  She relies on people to distill the most important information from those that report directly to her.   For instance, a CEO might have many layers between them and the customers.  Would a CEO have a better perspective about her customers by seeing a dashboard with a CSAT score over a frontline support team member who works directly with the customers every day? </p><p id="viewer-cf02t">When everybody wants answers, asking more questions can feel like a distraction.  The management team could also feel frustrated by having to explain and rationalize all the things.  But if you haven't provided enough information to your employees, how can they be expected to believe in the mission.  The mind--at least my mind-- doesn't like unanswered questions and tends to create answers from the information at hand and use copious amounts of assumptions to fill in any missing gaps.  Many of those assumptions come from the "the sky is falling" segment of the brain. Being receptive to employees asking questions can fill those gaps with qualified information.</p><p id="viewer-d53j5">Questions can disrupt long-standing processes, methods, and practices.  I would argue that these practices should be among the first things questioned.  Many times we habitually go through the motions of these processes without thinking.  This blocks inspiration. Stepping back and questioning the process can improve your decision making.</p><p id="viewer-fvek5">Leveraging all the different perspectives, backgrounds, and unique experiences of the workforce can raise important issues, and focus resources are more important tasks.  </p><h3 id="viewer-ee6si"><strong>Growing People Through Questions</strong></h3><p id="viewer-7td3">Much of my background is in support so I relate stories to that specific department.  I often see larger support organizations provide a more scripted environment for handling support interactions.  They push reliance on tools like internal knowledgebases, runbooks, and response templates to provide a consistent support experience.  I would first like to state that all these tools are important in any support organization and can greatly speed up the onboarding process for new employees. The downside of over-reliance on those tools is that they can reduce the ability of the frontline personnel to learn, master the service or product they are supporting, reduce their ability to view issues from a different perspective, and ultimately not inspire them to ask questions.</p><p id="viewer-68i8f">To illustrate what I mean, I can go over an example of following a recipe. Since I love curry, we'll use that. I'm hoping to avoid being flamed by Thai Curry purists, but to keep things simple, below is a basic list of ingredients for a Thai green curry:</p><ul><li id="viewer-6ccr6"><p>1 can curry paste</p></li><li id="viewer-9m72i"><p>1 can coconut milk</p></li><li id="viewer-e99pf"><p>1 cup chicken broth</p></li><li id="viewer-5ia38"><p>1 tbsp sugar</p></li><li id="viewer-74ljv"><p>2 tsp fish sauce</p></li><li id="viewer-8r5et"><p>1 eggplant</p></li><li id="viewer-321ur"><p>1 chicken breast</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-bujht">The steps to actually prepare a curry aren't relevant to this example but you can make a good curry with that small list of ingredients.  After completing the recipe a few times, you probably won't need to use the directions as you will have memorized it and be able to produce a good result consistently without thinking. </p><p id="viewer-a7k4b">Now, what do you do if someone wants their curry with more spice?  Or less spice? Or they were out of Eggplants at the market? Or out of the certified organic chicken breast you like?  Many people will go search for another recipe.  But what if I had originally provided you with the basics of what curry was and asked you to make a curry using that framework?  A more generic ingredient list might be:</p><ul><li id="viewer-3n73p"><p>A curry paste made up of primarily Thai chiles, garlic, lemongrass, spices, ginger, and green onions</p></li><li id="viewer-6pf36"><p>Chicken broth </p></li><li id="viewer-4tf8e"><p>Can of coconut milk</p></li><li id="viewer-c80kh"><p>Sugar to sweeten</p></li><li id="viewer-i0oh"><p>Fish oil for saltiness</p></li><li id="viewer-djrqg"><p>Any Vegetables</p></li><li id="viewer-1hlid"><p>Any Poultry/Beef/Seafood</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-fnfts">You would gain a better understanding through trial and error.  Yes, the first, second, or maybe even third curry you make might be horrible. But that fourth one--amazing.  Through asking yourself questions you learn more about how to be more flexible based on the available ingredients.  What do I do if it's too spicy?   How can I make it sweeter? Can I use some of the vegetables I found at the farmers' market?  Can I use shrimp?   Now you can make better decisions as you understand how all the ingredients relate to each other.</p><p id="viewer-7rbms">Answering a question doesn't always solve the problem.  With support, you first need to understand the problem (empathy skills) and deliver the correct response (knowledge skills).   Larger support organizations are looking for keywords in the text or prefabricated response.  Sometimes a customer is only describing the symptom so asking what the end goal is (either internal dialogue or actually asking the customer) is key to figuring out what the real issue is and providing a knowledgeable response.  So instead of handing them a script for every possible customer inquiry, provide them with a basic framework to start with and build upon that. An example customer interaction framework:</p><ol><li id="viewer-8dsld"><p>What is the real issue/goal of the customer?</p></li><li id="viewer-c8vqt"><p>What is the best way to resolve this issue?</p></li><li id="viewer-2uv2s"><p>What are the expected results of the solution?</p></li><li id="viewer-16hvl"><p>What are the next steps?</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-9l0v2">Checklists and processes have their place in basic operations like closing an account, updating billing information, or other tasked based operations. Most interactions with customers require empathy and understanding to start to solve their root issue.</p><h2 id="viewer-fpg6i"><strong>How can we encourage questioning?</strong></h2><p id="viewer-b7moa">For starters, we need to provide an environment that not only welcomes questions but encourages them.  Facebook and Google (and I'm sure others do as well) have weekly question and answer sessions with the CEO.  Questions are submitted through a message board and then upvoted by other employees.  The CEO then takes time every week to answer the highest upvoted questions.  The message board gives an opportunity for employees to ask questions whenever inspiration reveals itself.   Often inspiration doesn't always follow after your manager asks "Are there any questions" in that late afternoon meeting.</p><p id="viewer-8i799">Also important is to provide a safe environment for asking questions.   There should be the ability to ask a question without fear of reprisal or having the question answered in a condescending or judgemental way.  All questions should be listened to intently and answered with respect.</p><p id="viewer-4minh">Perhaps the hardest questions for individuals to ask are questions that might cause more responsibility or work for them.  "Why are we not are we not doing X?" can lead to "That's a great idea, now you do X in addition to your current duties".  Which could make an employee less interested in asking good questions.  To mitigate that feeling, you could follow up the "That's a great idea!" by asking how they would like to contribute to making that a reality or if they would like to contribute at all.  </p><p id="viewer-5h7ut">Offer training on asking questions.  I find the best questions contain some or all of the following elements:</p><ol><li id="viewer-5aikg"><p>Open-ended</p></li><li id="viewer-bt1jk"><p>No personal attacks</p></li><li id="viewer-3i6jb"><p>Non-leading</p></li><li id="viewer-4eb11"><p>Challenge assumptions</p></li><li id="viewer-f20bt"><p>Ask only one question at a time</p></li></ol><p id="viewer-817ng">That's not a definitive list, and there are certainly more elements to qualifying a question as good or not, but it is a starting point.</p><h2 id="viewer-7he0t"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p id="viewer-ehs97">Asking questions is the best path to learning, creativity, and understanding.  Providing an environment that promotes questions has many advantages from growing frontline personnel as well as challenging upper management to communicate more effectively.  Questions can strengthen trust between manager and employee and improve belief in the company or group mission.  An insightful question from one individual can create an eruption of creativity from all parts of an organization making the whole stronger than the sum of the parts.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

Rob has a storied career in Silicon Valley having been at several noteworthy startups like Jask (acquired by Sumo Logic) and prior to that one of the architects of Netflix at a critical time in its life as it transitioned from a DVD by mail business to the global streaming giant that we know of today.

<h2>You are doing public cloud <strong>wrong</strong>.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>While all the research says companies are accelerating migration to public cloud (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-11-13-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-17-percent-in-2020"><span>$355B globally by 2022</span></a>), what’s lost in the noise is how companies are inefficient at building infrastructure once they get there. <a href="https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020?lead_source=PPC&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=NB-State-Of-Cloud&amp;campaignid=10760212027&amp;adgroupid=111812831691&amp;utm_term=%2Bstate%20%2Bof%20%2Bthe%20%2Bcloud&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw2Jb7BRBHEiwAXTR4jSZOJMCOYGWIG-ZIpwTiUHve8ALKMJZBxiCBN-KCgd7a1lN9pkV6LRoC27EQAvD_BwE"><span>Flexera’s enterprise study from 2020</span></a> has validated the customer’s pain. The study reveals the frustrating customer story as more and more loads are moved into public cloud. Highlighted in the study is how customers need help to deal with cost issues, optimization needs for cost savings, and expertise and technology to deal with complexity. To add to customer angst, as companies desire to move more loads into public cloud, they additionally want to do so with more than one cloud service provider to commoditize and diversify the services but increases the challenges mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the paralyzing realities in customers' daily lives is an inability to hire people with cloud expertise to help solve these issues. Even though public cloud has been around for over a decade, this extended period of time has not translated to providing a sufficient supply of experienced people to meet the business need for proper public cloud adoption.</p>
<p>In the years since I left Netflix, I’ve seen the customer struggles first hand and experienced them myself at companies I’ve led. Working at Netflix was an opportunity that showed me how to leverage public cloud <strong>‘right’</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Netflix adopting public cloud was an evolutionary step as a primary business model for a company. Similarly, today’s evolution in public cloud technology can help be a driving force for companies to be successful in building cloud-based architectures. Typically taking the form of a Platform-as-a-Service (Paas), these solutions abstract away complexity to provide optimized technical architectures that span globally across different public cloud providers while reducing costs and filling in the void of missing technical expertise.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I was introduced to one such team &amp; technology. At first glance, their technology seemed to be an improvement and more easily implementable approach to what is commonly referred to as Edge Computing. As I spent time with the co-founders and the technology, I realized the noticeable separation of their offering compared to the competition. If you’ve spent any time studying the Edge Computing space, you’ll quickly come to realize this term has different definitions depending on the use case and customer. However, this company had technology that could solve all of them with an impressive and broad set of exceptional customers to validate them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the excitement of realizing the potential for both the team and the technology, I’m delighted today to be part of the public announcement of the DNX Ventures lead in the seed+ round investment in Macrometa for the next stage of growth for this successful edge computing platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been such a pleasure working with the Macrometa team. Co-founders Chetan Venkatesh (CEO) and Durga Gokina (CTO) are the right mixes of intelligence, creative passion, understanding of strengths and weaknesses in the space, with high-achieving results. Watching their impressive traction and the vision of what this company could accomplish in the space will be fun to watch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is the right time for the Macrometa team and their technology. Public cloud growth is increasing. Businesses desire to handle the challenges in front of them better and require optimization and reduction of costs. All will drive adoption in the edge computing space. The expertise Macrometa brings to supplement existing engineering initiatives along with Macrometa’s technologies capability of simplifying architectures for faster innovation at a lower cost will be a few of their keys to success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the future, I think we will look back at the year 2020 as the beginning of a transformative change in what it means to build and efficiently leverage the public cloud.</p>
<p>I am excited to join this team as a board member and enjoy contributing to Macrometa’s journey to make edge computing ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p></span>

<p>
Somewhere in the concrete canyons of New York City a
recently formed rock group is using the name Jim Jones and
the Suicides. Irreverent and disarming, the name reflects
the new trend in punk rock, to take social issues head on.
Cynicism about the Jonestown deaths and its social
parallels abound in the lyrics of today's music. The
messages are clear because we all know the story.

</p><div><p>
In fact, people today recognize the name "Jonestown"
more than any other event, a full 98% of the population.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]</span>
The television and printed media were filled with the news
for more than a year, even though the tale read like
something from the <i>National Enquirer</i> tabloid. But
despite all the coverage, the reality of Jonestown and the
reasons behind the bizarre events remain a mystery. The
details have faded from memory for most of us since
November 18, 1978, but not the outlines. Think back a
moment and you'll remember.

<br>
<a name="p1">
</a></p><p>

<b>
<span face="arial,helvetica">
You Know the Official Version
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
A fanatic religious leader in California led a
multiracial community into the jungles of remote Guyana to
establish a socialist utopia. The People's Temple, his
church, was in the heart of San Francisco and drew poor
people, social activists, Blacks and Hispanics, young and
old. The message was racial harmony and justice, and
criticism of the hypocrisy of the world around his
followers.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn2">2</a>]</span>

</p><p>
The Temple rose in a vacuum of leadership at the end of
an era.  The political confrontations of the 60s were
almost over, and religious cults and "personal
transformation" were on the rise. Those who had preached a
similar message on the political soap box were gone, burnt
out, discredited, or dead. The counter-culture had
apparently degenerated into drugs and violence. Charlie
Manson was the only visible image of the period. Suddenly,
religion seemed to offer a last hope.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn3">3</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Even before they left for the Jonestown site, the
People's Temple members were subjects of local scandal in
the news.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn4">4</a>]</span> Jim Jones claimed these exposés were
attacks on their newly-found religion, and used them as an
excuse to move most of the members to Guyana.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn5">5</a>]</span> But
disturbing reports continued to surround Jones, and soon
came to the attention of congressional members like Leo
Ryan. Stories of beatings, kidnapping, sexual abuse and
mysterious deaths leaked out in the press.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn6">6</a>]</span> Ryan decided
to go to Guyana and investigate the situation for himself.
The nightmare began.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn7">7</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Isolated on the tiny airstrip at Port Kaituma, Ryan and
several reporters in his group were murdered. Then came the
almost unbelievable "White Night," a mass suicide pact of
the Jonestown camp. A community made up mostly of Blacks
and women drank cyanide from paper cups of <i>Kool-Aid</i>,
adults and children alike died and fell around the main
pavilion. Jones himself was shot in the head, an apparent
suicide. For days, the body count mounted, from 400 to
nearly 1,000. The bodies were flown to the United States
and later cremated or buried in mass graves.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn8">8</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Temple member Larry Layton is still facing charges of
conspiracy in Ryan's murder. Ryan was recently awarded a
posthumous Medal of Honor, and was the first Congress
member to die in the line of duty.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn9">9</a>]</span>

</p><div><p>
Pete Hammill called the corpses "all the loose change
of the sixties."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn10">10</a>]</span> The effect was electric. Any
alternative to the current system was seen as futile, if
not deadly. Protest only led to police riots and political
assassination. Alternative life styles and drugs led to
"creepy-crawly" communes and violent murders.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn11">11</a>]</span> And
religious experiments led to cults and suicide. Social
utopias were dreams that turned into nightmares. The
television urged us to go back to "The Happy Days" of the
apolitical 50s. The message was, get a job, and go back to
church.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn12">12</a>]</span> The unyielding nuclear threat generated only
nihilism and hopelessness. There was no answer but death,
no exit from the grisly future. The new ethic was personal
success, aerobics, material consumption, a return to
"American values," and the "moral majority" white Christian
world.  The official message was clear.

<span face="arial,helvetica">
But Just Suppose 
<br>
It Didn't Happen That Way...
</span>
</b></p></div><p>
The headlines the day of the massacre read: "Cult Dies
in South American Jungle: 400 Die in Mass Suicide, 700 Flee
into Jungle."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn13">13</a>]</span> By all accounts in the press, as well as
People's Temple statements there were at least 1,100 people
at Jonestown.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn14">14</a>]</span> There were 809 adult passports found
there, and reports of 300 children (276 found among the
dead, and 210 never identified). The headline figures from
the first day add to the same number: 1,100.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn15">15</a>]</span>
The original body count done by the Guyanese was 408, and this figure
was initially agreed to by U.S. Army authorities on
site.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn16">16</a>]</span>
However, over the next few days, the total of reported dead began to
rise quickly. The Army made a series of misleading and openly false
statements about the discrepancy. The new total, which was the official
final count, was given almost a week later by American authorities as
913.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn17">17</a>]</span>
A total of 16 survivors were reported to have returned to the
U.S.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn18">18</a>]</span> Where were the others?

</p><p>
At their first press conference, the Americans claimed
that the Guyanese "could not count." These local people had
carried out the gruesome job of counting the bodies, and
later assisted American troops in the process of poking
holes in the flesh lest they explode from the gasses of
decay.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn19">19</a>]</span> Then the Americans proposed another theory --
they had missed seeing a pile of bodies at the back of the
pavilion. The structure was the size of a small house, and
they had been at the scene for days.  Finally, we were
given the official reason for the discrepancy -- bodies had
fallen on top of other bodies, adults covering
children.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn20">20</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It was a simple, if morbid, arithmetic that led to the
first suspicions. The 408 bodies discovered at first count
would have to be able to cover 505 bodies for a total of
913. In addition, those who first worked on the bodies
would have been unlikely to miss bodies lying beneath each
other since each body had to be punctured. Eighty-two of
the bodies first found were those of children, reducing the
number that could have been hidden below others.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn21">21</a>]</span> A
search of nearly 150 photographs, aerial and close-up,
fails to show even one body lying under another, much less
500.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn22">22</a>]</span>

</p><p>
It seemed the first reports were true, 400 had died,
and 700 had fled to the jungle. The American authorities
claimed to have searched for people who had escaped, but
found no evidence of any in the surrounding area.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn23">23</a>]</span> At
least a hundred Guyanese troops were among the first to
arrive, and they were ordered to search the jungle for
survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn24">24</a>]</span> In the area, at the same time, British Black
Watch troops were on "training exercises," with nearly 600
of their best-trained commandos. Soon, American Green
Berets were on site as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn25">25</a>]</span> The presence of these
soldiers, specially trained in covert killing operations,
may explain the increasing numbers of bodies that
appeared.

</p><p>
Most of the photographs show the bodies in neat rows,
face down. There are few exceptions. Close shots indicate
drag marks, as though the bodies were positioned by someone
after death.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn26">26</a>]</span> Is it possible that the 700 who fled were
rounded up by these troops, brought back to Jonestown and
added to the body count?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn27">27</a>]</span>

</p><p>
If so, the bodies would indicate the cause of death. A
new word was coined by the media, "suicide-murder." But
which was it?<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn28">28</a>]</span> Autopsies and forensic science are a
developing art. The detectives of death use a variety of
scientific methods and clues to determine how people die,
when they expire, and the specific cause of death. Dr.
Mootoo, the top Guyanese pathologist, was at Jonestown
within hours after the massacre. Refusing the assistance of
U.S. pathologists, he accompanied the teams that counted
the dead, examined the bodies, and worked to identify the
deceased. While the American press screamed about the
"Kool-Aid Suicides," Dr. Mootoo was reaching a much
different opinion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn29">29</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are certain signs that show the types of poisons
that lead to the end of life. Cyanide blocks the messages
from the brain to the muscles by changing body chemistry in
the central nervous system. Even the "involuntary"
functions like breathing and heartbeat get mixed neural
signals. It is a painful death, breath coming in spurts.
The other muscles spasm, limbs twist and contort. The
facial muscles draw back into a deadly grin, called
"cyanide rictus."<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn30">30</a>]</span> All these telling signs were absent
in the Jonestown dead. Limbs were limp and relaxed, and the
few visible faces showed no sign of distortion.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn31">31</a>]</span>

</p><p>
Instead, Dr. Mootoo found fresh needle marks at the
back of the left shoulder blades of 80-90% of the
victims.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn32">32</a>]</span> Others had been shot or strangled. One
survivor reported that those who resisted were forced by
armed guards.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn33">33</a>]</span> The gun that reportedly shot Jim Jones
was lying nearly 200 feet from his body, not a likely
suicide weapon.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn34">34</a>]</span> As Chief Medical Examiner, Mootoo's
testimony to the Guyanese grand jury investigating
Jonestown led to their conclusion that all but three of the
people were murdered by "persons unknown." Only two had
committed suicide they said.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn35">35</a>]</span> Several pictures show the
gun-shot wounds on the bodies as well.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn36">36</a>]</span> The U.S. Army
spokesman, Lt. Col. Schuler, said, "No autopsies are
needed. The cause of death is not an issue here." The
forensic doctors who later did autopsies at Dover,
Delaware, were never made aware of Dr. Mootoo's
findings.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn37">37</a>]</span>

</p><p>
There are other indications that the Guyanese
government participated with American authorities in a
cover-up of the real story, despite their own findings. One
good example was Guyanese Police Chief Lloyd Barker, who
interfered with investigations, helped "recover" 2.5
million for the Guyanese government, and was often the
first to officially announce the cover stories relating to
suicide, body counts and survivors.<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1">[<a href="#fn38">38</a>]</span> Among the first to
the scene were the wife of Guyanese Prime …</p></td></tr></tbody></div></div>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I thought <a href="https://dev.to/blarzhernandez/just-keep-coding-a-letter-to-junior-developers-21h8">this article</a> was worth sharing, as it is a relatively inexperienced developer talking to newer devs. But as I read it, one piece of advice stuck out and is worth emphasizing.</p>



<blockquote><p>Plan first, then code</p><cite> Roberto Hernandez</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is fundamental. Unlike, say carpentry, where planning is critical because you waste material if you don’t, coding sometimes feels like you can “just start.” After all, if you make a mistake, you can delete the code and start over (as long as you’re operating on your own development environment, not production). Seeing what you’re building is satisfying, both to you as a builder and anyone else you share your work with.</p>



<p>However, “just starting” is a recipe for waste, if what you start is writing code. </p>



<p>The first thing you should do before writing a single line of code is understand the problem. Depending on the size and scale of the problem, confirming this understanding could be as simple as repeating the request back to the person who made it: “so what you are saying is you want me to change the button text to blue” and thinking through the ramifications: “that will work on form A and B, but what about form C?”. </p>



<p>Or it could be as complicated as writing up a specifications document with the proposed changes and architecture, getting feedback on it, running it by the appropriate people or committees, and getting sign-off from stakeholders, including executives and customers.</p>



<p>Then, after you confirm you understand the problem and proposed solution, plan on how you are going to execute against it. For a small problem, this could involve starting immediately by writing or thinking of a list of tasks to do, though often you’ll want to add it to a todo list or calendar to ensure this task isn’t lost among the sea of other tasks you have. For a larger problem, there may be cross team coordination required, so: meetings and documents. </p>



<p>After you understand the problem and have a plan for how to accomplish this goal, you can begin writing code.</p>



<p>Avoid jumping in and writing code because the time to feedback is long. Compared to what? Compared to text, images or meetings. These are so much easier to iterate. If you write some code to solve the wrong problem or address it in the wrong manner, you’ve used more time than you would have if you’d talked through the problem.</p>



<p>It is also harder to communicate concepts with code, especially with non technical colleagues. Even with fellow engineers, a diagram or conversation is an easier way to explain ideas than written code. I’ve often whiteboarded a solution in a fraction of the time it would have taken to prototype it. Code is more precise and you can’t handwave a problem away, but there’s lots of chaff around the germ of the idea in many code bases. </p>



<p>There are times when writing code is the right way to start, though. This is called prototyping and if there’s no way to gain an understanding of the problem by reading, learning, discussing or otherwise approaching it, write some code to explore it. However, be prepared to throw this code away, as it will be the equivalent of a hastily scratched note on a napkin.</p>



<p>I do want to emphasize that this understanding and planning process doesn’t always have to be heavyweight and formal. In fact, for smaller tasks, you may internalize this process and not even realize you are doing it. </p>



<p>Next time you are working on a small task, take a moment and think about how you break it up into even smaller bits of work: “ok, I need to add this form. Therefore I need a model and a view too, and what are the methods I should add to validate the input?” </p>



<p>You don’t need to produce documentation and artifacts for every decision, but you would do well to at least in your own head think through the tasks and the ramifications of those tasks. This will help you <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/09/16/learn-to-look-around-corners/">look around corners</a> and see issues that may arise because of your solution. If you do, you can modify the solution, again, before any code is written. </p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

<p><strong>MulticoreWare is a software development company that works on video compression, ML, heterogeneous computing, and championed the open-source x265 encoder in the past. They are now driving the x266 project to create an open-source VVC (Versatile Video Coding) encoder and use their experience from their UHDKit product to make it the premier open-source VVC encoder.</strong></p>




<h2><span id="Who_is_MulticoreWare"></span><strong>Who is MulticoreWare?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://multicorewareinc.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="MulticoreWare (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">MulticoreWare</a> is a multi-faceted company with expertise in different verticals such as high-performance Video Compression, AI &amp; Video Analytics, ADAS (Automated Driver Assistance), etc. A common thread through these verticals is their ability to design and write high-performance code for various computing platforms. MulticoreWare’s background and experience are cool, in my opinion, and how they’ve nurtured and built a strong team in a very complex niche is admirable.</p>



<p>With teams in the US, India, China, and Germany, MulticoreWare is well-placed to don the role of a thought-leader in the open-source video codec world.</p>



<p>Let’s see why and what their plans are!</p>



<h2><span id="The_Road_To_x266_%E2%80%93_An_Open_Source_VVC_Encoder"></span><strong>The Road To x266 – An Open Source VVC Encoder</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>MPEG announced three new video codecs – VVC (Versatile Video Coding), EVC (Essential Video Coding), and LCEVC (Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding). Of these three, VVC or H.266 is touted as the successor to H.265 (HEVC) and promises 50% more compression efficiency over HEVC but comes at a much higher complexity. Here’s a <a href="https://ottverse.com/vvc-evc-lcevc-mpeg-video-codecs/">brief explanation of all three</a> on OTTVerse.</p>



<p>But, first, let’s take a look at HEVC and the x265 encoder.</p>



<h3><span id="x265_and_HEVC"></span><strong>x265 and HEVC</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>MulticoreWare announced the <a href="https://x265.com/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">x265 project</a> back in 2013, and it was a success. x265 allowed video compression teams worldwide to get their hands on an efficient, standards-compliant HEVC encoder. x265 was made available under the open-source <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">GNU GPL v2 license</a> and also offered by MulticoreWare under Commercial License Agreements.</p>



<p>But, having a good encoder clearly wasn’t enough. Because, fast-forward 7 years, and unfortunately, HEVC is still embroiled in patent-wars that seem destined to give it a “death by a thousand cuts.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEVC’s situation is rather unfortunate considering that HEVC had interesting features such as the use of quadtree-decomposition, large block sizes, the concept of TU, PU, and CUs, the Sample Adaptive Offset filter, new picture types, and several innovations which made it possible to compress 4K videos quite efficiently (in comparison to H.264/AVC).</p>



<h3><span id="The_x266_Project"></span><strong>The x266 Project</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Riding on the back of their x265 success, MulticoreWare has decided to pioneer the x266 project along the x265 project lines they worked on earlier. x266 will be an open-source project with the MulticoreWare video compression team’s full attention and the backing of an industry-consortium.</p>



<p>As with any new codec, there are always early adopters (both programmers and companies) willing to give it a try, evaluate, file tickets, and contribute code. But, to get the ball rolling, you need a reliable encoder that is not only standards-compliant but also reasonably fast and with enough presets and knobs to make the early-adoption both valuable and exciting (in a geeky-sense!)</p>



<p>I spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivakumarasu/" target="_blank" aria-label="Shivakumar Narayanan (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shivakumar Narayanan</a>, Senior Director – Marketing and Product Management at MulticoreWare, about the consortium, and this is what he had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Similar to when we did this for x265 consortium, to get key consortium members on board and invest in the development of this codec. These members will be founding partners with benefits when the codec (rather encoder is ready to release for the open-source world). Consortium members being strategic, will also play an important role in the shaping of this codec as well as prioritization of functionalities as it would pertain to their and their customers’ interests.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Industry involvement bodes well for the open-source community because <strong>video encoder implementation is both an art and a science.</strong></p>



<p>It helps to have a proficient team that understands and implements concepts such as wavefront parallelism, multi-threading, intrinsics, etc. to make codec implementations practical and useful. And, of course, people with “golden eyes” to spot issues with video quality as they occur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MulticoreWare has such a team, and I feel they’ll bring their experience from x265 to the x266 development.</p>



<h3><span id="Expertise_from_UHDKit"></span><strong>Expertise from UHDKit</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>Another product in MulticoreWare’s portfolio is <a href="https://x265.com/uhdkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UHDKit</a>. It is an extended encoding library built on top of the x264 (AVC) encoder and x265 (HEVC) encoder libraries. It has a better performance and feature-set than the vanilla x264, x265, and svt-av1 encoders. UHDKit comes in-built with powerful features such as a “control system for video compression” that dynamically adjusts settings to achieve better video quality based on the computing platform’s spec. </p>



<p>Additional features include fast ABR encoding (to get the bitrate ladder faster!) and high-performance live encoding, all this on software, without any requirement for additional hardware accelerators. It can be used as a standalone encoding library or can be invoked via the FFmpeg framework, which makes it seamlessly integrate into any software encoding/ transcoding pipeline.</p>



<p>I am sure some of this expertise from building UHDKit will rub off on the x266 encoder development.</p>



<h2><span id="How_Do_I_Get_my_hands_on_x266"></span><strong>How Do I Get my hands on x266?</strong><span></span></h2>



<p>Currently, MulticoreWare is working closely with x266 Consortium members and after a few months, it will be available to them.</p>



<p>Upon enquiring about the open-source implementation, here’s what MCW had to say –</p>



<blockquote><p><em>For the larger open source community, it will be made available when we have reached critical mass required for its first release. As we near readiness, we will update here on how you can get hold of it.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>If you have any questions for the MulticoreWare team, please get in touch with Shivakumar Narayanan at <a aria-label="x266@multicorewareinc.com (opens in a new tab)" href="mailto:x266@multicorewareinc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">x266@multicorewareinc.com</a>.</p>



<p>Also, many thanks to <a aria-label="Praveen Kumar Karadugattu (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveenkpk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Praveen Kumar Karadugattu</a>, Video Architect at MulticoreWare for kicking off this discussion between MulticoreWare and OTTVerse.com. </p>

October 19, 2020 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/assorted-thoughts-on-zig-and-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I've been using <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a> for ~4 months worth of side projects, including a <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus/tree">toy text editor</a> and an <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/imp">interpreter for a relational language</a>. I've written ~10kloc.</p>
<p>That's not nearly enough time to form a coherent informed opinion. So instead here is an incoherent assortment of thoughts and experiences, in no particular order :)</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an introduction to zig - check out the excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/">language docs</a> or the new <a href="https://ziglearn.org/">ziglearn.org</a> instead. I'll try to focus instead on things that are not immediately obvious from reading intro material.</p>
<p>The obvious point of comparison is to rust. For context, I've been using rust <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/three-months-of-rust/">since 2015</a>. Mostly in research positions writing throwaway code, but also ~14 months working on <a href="https://materialize.io/">a commercial database</a> which is ~100kloc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig is dramatically simpler than rust. It took a few days before I felt proficient vs a month or more for rust.</p>
<p>Most of this difference is <strong>not</strong> related to lifetimes. Rust has patterns, traits, dyn, modules, declarative macros, procedural macros, derive, associated types, annotations, cfg, cargo features, turbofish, autoderefencing, deref coercion etc. I encountered most of these in the first week. Just understanding how they all work is a significant time investment, let alone learning when to use each and how they affect the available design space.</p>
<p>I still haven't internalized the full rule-set of rust enough to be able predict whether a design in my head will successfully compile. I don't remember the order in which methods are resolved during autoderefencing, or how module visibility works, or how the type system determines if one impl might <a href="https://github.com/Ixrec/rust-orphan-rules#what-are-the-orphan-rules">overlap another or be an orphan</a>. There are frequent moments where I know what I want the machine to do but struggle to encode it into traits and lifetimes.</p>
<p>Zig manages to provide many of the same features with a single mechanism - compile-time execution of regular zig code. This comes will all kinds of pros and cons, but one large and important pro is that I already know how to write regular code so it's easy for me to just write down the thing that I want to happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key differences between zig and rust is that when writing a generic function, rust will prove that the function is type-safe for every possible value of the generic parameters. Zig will prove that the function is type-safe only for each parameter that you actually call the function with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this allows zig to make use of arbitrary compile-time logic where rust has to restrict itself to structured systems (traits etc) about which it can form general proofs. This in turn allows zig a great deal of expressive power and also massively simplifies the language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can't type-check zig libraries which contain generics. We can only type-check specific uses of those libraries.</p>
<pre><span>// This function is typesafe if there exist no odd perfect numbers
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number#Odd_perfect_numbers
fn foo(comptime n: comptime_int, i: usize) usize {
  const j = if (comptime is_odd_perfect_number(n)) "surprise!" else 1;
  return i + j;
}
</span></pre>
<p>This means zig also doesn't get the automatic, machine-checked documentation of type constraints that rust benefits from and may face more challenges providing IDE support.</p>
<p>This might harm the zig ecosystem by making it harder to compose various libraries. But <a href="https://julialang.org/">julia</a> has a similar model and in practice it has worked very well (<a href="https://youtu.be/dmWQtI3DFFo?t=1710">eg</a>, <a href="https://www.oxinabox.net/2020/02/09/whycompositionaljulia.html">eg</a>).</p>
<hr>
<p>Zig's comptime allows expressing <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">open multiple dispatch</a> as a library.</p>
<p>It should be relatively trivial to implement specialization the same way, which has been a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">work in progress</a> in rust for years and is critical to many optimizations in julia's math libraries.</p>
<p>Julia chose dynamic typing because it's very difficult to encode the types of various mathematical operations into a general schema (eg fortress <a href="https://youtu.be/EZD3Scuv02g?t=3011">struggled with this</a>). Zig's approach of not requiring general schemas but still type-checking individual cases may be an interesting sweet spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>I used the <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1350.html">2020 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses</a> to get a sense of the relative frequency of different causes of memory unsafety.</p>
<p>(I'm assuming that the zig programmer is using release-safe mode instead of the unfortunately named release-fast mode which disables all runtime safety checks.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-bounds Write (787/1350)</li>
<li>Out-of-bounds Read (125/1350)</li>
<li>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (119/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages primarily use bounds-checked slices and relegate pointer arithmetic to a separate type (<code>*T</code> in rust, <code>[*]T</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>NULL Pointer Dereference (476/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Both languages require explicit annotations for nulls (<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> in rust, <code>?T</code> in zig) and require code to either handle the null case or safely crash on null (<code>x.unwrap()</code> in rust, <code>x.?</code> in zig).</p>
<p>Dereferencing/casting a null c pointer is undefined behavior in both languages, but is checked at runtime in zig.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integer Overflow or Wraparound (190/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>Rust catches overflow in debug and wraps in release. Zig catches overflow in debug/release-safe and leaves behavior undefined in release-fast.</p>
<p>Both languages allow explicitly asking for wraparound (<code>x.wrapping_add(1)</code> in rust, <code>x +% 1</code> in zig).</p>
<ul>
<li>Use After Free (416/1350)</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as all unsafe code obeys the aliasing and lifetime rules, rust protects completely against UAF.</p>
<p>Zig has little protection. The recently merged
<a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/575fbd5e3592cff70cbfc5153884d919e6bed89f/lib/std/heap/general_purpose_allocator.zig">GeneralPurposeAllocator</a> avoids reusing memory regions (which prevents freed data from being overwritten) and reusing pages (which means that UAF will eventually result in a page fault). But this comes at the cost of fragmentation and lower performance and it also won't provide protection for child allocators using the GPA as a backing allocator.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both languages will insert implicit casts between primitive types and pointers whenever it is safe to do so, and require explicit casts otherwise. (With the odd exception that rust will not implicitly upcast numbers).</p>
<p>Both languages support generics which almost entirely avoids the need to cast void pointers.</p>
<hr>
<p>In rust the Send/Sync traits flag types which are safe to move/share across threads. In the absence of unsafe code it should be impossible to cause data races.</p>
<p>Zig has no comparable protection. It's possible to implement the same logic as Send/Sync in comptime zig, but without the ability to track ownership the rules would have to be much more restrictive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rust prevents having multiple mutable references to the same memory region at the same time.</p>
<p>This means that eg iterator invalidation is prevented at compile time, because the borrow checker won't allow mutating a data-structure while an iterator is holding a reference to the data-structure. Similarly for resizing a data-structure while holding a reference to the old allocation. Both examples are easy sources of UAF in zig.</p>

<p>Neither language is able to produce stack traces for stack overflows at the moment (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51405">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1616">zig</a>)</p>
<p>In the future zig is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1006">intended</a> to statically check the maximum stack usage of your program and force recursive code to explicitly allocate space on the heap, so that stack overflows produce a recoverable OutOfMemory error rather than a crash.</p>
<p>This is not an academic problem - I've seen real-world crashes from recursive tree transformations in compilers (<a href="https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/pull/3996">eg</a>) and it's often painful to write the same logic without recursion.</p>
<hr>
<p>Undefined behavior in rust is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/what-unsafe-does.html">here</a>. It's worth noting that breaking the aliasing rules in unsafe rust can cause undefined behavior but these rules are not yet well-defined. So far this hasn't caused me any problems but it is a little unnerving.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a> is an interpreter for rusts Mid-level Intermediate Representation which will detect many (but not all) cases of undefined behavior in unsafe rust. It's far too slow to use for the whole materialize test suite but was useful for unit-testing an unsafe module.</p>
<p>Undefined behavior in zig is defined <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Undefined-Behavior">here</a>. This list is <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1966">probably incomplete</a> given that the core language is still under development.</p>
<p>Zig <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2301">aspires</a> to insert runtime checks for almost all undefined behavior when compiling in debug mode. So far all the easy cases are handled, which is already a dramatic improvement over c.</p>
<p>Zigs compile-time partial evaluation is done by an IR interpreter - it seems plausible that this could also be used as a miri-like tool in the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>@import</code> takes a path to a file and turns the whole file into a struct. So modules are just structs. And vice-versa - if you have a large struct declaration you can move it into a file to reduce the indentation.</p>
<p>Zig doesn't care at all where you put files on the filesystem.</p>
<p><code>@import</code> is part of the compile-time execution system so things like platform-specific modules and configurable features can be specified in regular code rather than rust's limited set of <code>#[cfg(...)]</code> macros.</p>
<hr>
<p>Array, struct, enum and union literals can be anonymous - <code>.{.Constant = 1.0}</code> is an anonymous union with it's own type, but can be implicitly cast to any union with a <code>Constant: f64</code> field because they share the same structure.</p>
<p>In rust my code is littered with <code>use Expr::*</code> and I'm careful to avoid name collisions between different enums that I might want to import in the same functions. In zig I just use anonymous literals everywhere and don't worry about it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anonymous literals are also nice when using structs to simulate keyword arguments. No need to find and import the correct type:</p>
<pre><span>fn do_things(config: struct {
  max_things: usize = 1000, // default value
  flavor: Flavor,
}) void {
  ...
}

do_things(.{.flavor = .Strawberry});
</span></pre>
<hr>
<p>There is a pattern that shows up a lot in the materialize codebase:</p>
<pre><span>let</span><span> constant </span><span>= </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(constant) </span><span>=</span><span> expr { constant } </span><span>else </span><span>{ </span><span>panic!</span><span>() }</span><span>;
</span></pre>
<p>It's common enough that many types have methods like <code>expr.unwrap_constant()</code>.</p>
<p>In zig:</p>
<pre><span>const constant = expr.Constant;
</span></pre>
<p>A similar pattern is:</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Expr</span><span>::</span><span>Constant(</span><span>_</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> expr {
        </span><span>...
    </span><span>}
}
</span></pre>
<p>Again, many types get methods like <code>expr.is_constant()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>if</span><span> some_condition </span><span>&amp;&amp;</span><span> expr</span><span>.</span><span>is_constant</span><span>(…</span></pre></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For better onboarding retention, get users to add value to your product as quickly as possible.</p><p>How?</p><h2>1. Create shortcuts to show only the relevant information (screen by preferences).</h2><p>Spotify asks users to select their favorite artists instead of going to dashboard:</p><figure id="w-node-213b4e788a3d-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8809c116cb645d12bb4594_spotify-onboarding.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you are a SaaS&nbsp;company that sells form building software, you could for example, ask what type of form the person is looking to create, then based on that selection provide an appropriate form template. This helps the user accomplish their task more quickly and they are more likely to stick with you after they've seen the value of your product.</p><h2>2. Take out unnecessary steps or save them for after the user has added value.</h2><p>SproutSocial does this well by instantly prompting to connect to social media accounts FIRST, and only then asking for additional information.</p><figure id="w-node-7da55c5c0f57-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880ef541456e5a30b5034b_SproutSocial%20Additional%20Connections.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>First the user is asked to connect their social profiles (this instantly populates their dashboard with valuable insights)</figcaption></figure><figure id="w-node-ac84d3ff6921-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f880272ff20a95ceb04363c_sproutsocial.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Then the user is asked to answer some questions that will help SproutSocial segment their audience. Notice how there were no massive forms to fill out - this is key.</figcaption></figure><h2>3. Try checklists which encourage user to take small steps to engage with your product or add their own value.</h2><p>There are all sorts of ways to present this (header notice, widget, embedded, welcome email)</p><figure id="w-node-ef9c31814aa4-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88028112b0af3c3a1e504b_checklist.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. Gamify with progression. Start them off with some steps already completed.</h2><p>If you are already using a checklist in your app's dashboard, you can start them off with some progress already made so that the user doesn't feel like they are starting from zero. </p><p>For example, you can cross off an item they've already completed (see above screenshot). </p><p>You could start them off at 20% instead of 0% when it comes to completing various steps to get to the "aha" moment of your product.</p><p>In multi-step onboarding you could visually indicate that the first step is already finished (presumably the 1st click to the form).</p><h2>5. Assist with templates - so user only has to modify contents.</h2><p><a href="http://pory.io/">Pory.io</a> is great at this. Instead of just dropping you off to let you figure out the tool on your own, they provide you with starting templates.</p><figure id="w-node-129cbdb09480-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802a8b78d93b942995c83_Pory.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If templates do not apply, you could add placeholder content so people know how to edit and where to start. Templates are a great way to get people to skip all the busy work of starting from scratch and provide a semi-finished starting point. </p><p>Canva does an excellent job by allowing people to select an asset they wish to create, and present fully-designed examples that only require some tweaking.</p><h2>6. If integrating with other tools, show personalized how-to videos specific to the integration.</h2><p>Most SaaS&nbsp;companies add their integration instructions in support documents. If the user has to leave your dashboard and hunt down support docs, they could just as easily go do something else. </p><p>By providing relevant integration videos within the dashboard, you keep the user engaged and more likely to finish the setup.</p><p>Memberstack provides a handy Webflow integration tutorial for people who are building in Webflow.<br></p><figure id="w-node-b21132cc9f9c-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8802dd24f28319c733480d_memberstack.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>7. Try adding integrations into the onboarding flow after they've already created an account</h2><p>If your tool or app integrates with other popular platforms, consider adding those integrations into the onboarding flow. </p><p>You often see companies have an "integrations" tab or section in their app, but very few add those to onboarding. </p><p>We can bypass the standard behavior and ask the user to integrate with a popular tool in a multi-step onboarding process. They have the option to skip, but once they add a one or two click connection, they are more likely to get hooked or have a chance to expose your product to everyone at their company.</p><h2>8. Reward with points and prizes if appropriate.</h2><p>Duolingo gives users virtual "lingots" which encourage user to keep going in order to collect enough to spend them.</p><figure id="w-node-ef0778b73aac-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803008701da7f3ec23ae7_duolingo-lingots.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>9. Provide the benefit of your product first, then ask user to create an account to save their work</h2><p><a href="http://priar.io/">Priar.io</a> does this by letting you preview their product with YOUR content before hitting "Generate link" to create an account.</p><figure id="w-node-6eeed1f77289-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88032af52d301ff3d87f39_piar.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>10. If product benefits from multiple people using it, prompt user to invite those people.</h2><p>BetterUptime prompts you to invite your colleagues as additional users:</p><figure id="w-node-3a1237c05f92-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f88034b16cb640d52bb33e6_better-uptime.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>11. Gift them with an upgraded version of their selected price tier, or gift full access.</h2><p>Netflix does this well by offering a free upgrade at the time of the trial.</p><figure id="w-node-ecd982c93506-d0fac31f"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f8194bf5b030146a768cd8c/5f8803bff7e683308565cef1_41.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>We have <a href="https://www.vrfinal.com/oculus-facebook-account-requirement-is-here/">previously reported</a> that the Oculus Quest 2 requires a Facebook account when setting it up. Now users are reporting that their accounts are being locked or banned by the social media giant’s verification system.</p><p>Users who do not have Facebook accounts or have to reactivate long dormant ones are reporting issues that cause instant suspensions. The account verification system is automated and in certain cases they require photographic evidence of the user’s identity. The photo will have to be assessed by a human. So, in the best-case scenario users will have to wait for weeks until the support team verifies their identity.</p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/Oculus-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/Oculus-2.png 600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/Oculus-2.png 1000w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/10/Oculus-2.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If the assessment fails, there does not seem to be any way to appeal or reverse the decision. Users have taken to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/japo1j/facebook_account_banned_within_10_minutes/">Reddit</a> and Twitter calling the Quest 2 a glorified “paperweight”.</p><p>In response to this issue, Facebook emailed a statement asking the affected customers to contact Oculus Support.</p><p><em>“People who are having trouble logging in to their device aren’t losing access to their purchased content, based on what we’re seeing in customer service reports. Someone may temporarily experience an issue accessing content if they have trouble logging in to Quest 2 with their Facebook account, but they will be able to access their content once those login issues are resolved.”</em></p><p>During an Instagram AMA, the VP of Augmented and Virtual Reality at Facebook, Andrew Bosworth, provided a response to questions about the account issues.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Boz gave me 3 clips of replies when everyone else got one, does this make me special? <a href="https://twitter.com/hmltn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hmltn</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gemisisDev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gemisisDev</a> <a href="https://t.co/E7kEAoZ8cK">pic.twitter.com/E7kEAoZ8cK</a></p>— Benjamin Bega (@thebigdev433) <a href="https://twitter.com/thebigdev433/status/1316926387664584704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p><em>“So, I mean I think people should continue to make sure their Facebook accounts are in good standing before they buy the headset. They can work through those problems before they do it.”</em></p><p>It seems controversial to place the onus on the customer; Facebook have already been in hot water over the anti-trust nature of this move and placing the blame on the user does not seem like the right way to go.</p>
